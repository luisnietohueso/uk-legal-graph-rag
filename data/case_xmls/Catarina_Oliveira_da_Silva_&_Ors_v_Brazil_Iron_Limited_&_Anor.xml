These are, or include, indigenous communities of &#8220;Quilombola&#8221; people who enjoy certain protections under Brazilian law. The evidence explains that Quilombolas are descendants of enslaved Africans trafficked to Brazil, who fled slavery and took refuge in the forests, establishing autonomous communities as a form of resistance to slave oppression whilst preserving their cultures and traditions. Self-declaration of Quilombola status earns an individual certain rights under Brazilian law, in particular as to property rights which may be relevant to their standing to make their claims. Quilombola status may also be relevant to the assessment of damages, because damages may take account not only of economic impact but also of the social and cultural impact of any damage to property.</span></p>

Cogent evidence does not mean unchallenged evidence (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Vedanta</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#160;at [96]). This is often conveniently treated as a second stage in the analysis because it usually calls for an assessment of different evidence, but it does not involve a different question: if there is a real risk of denial of justice in a particular forum it is unlikely to be an appropriate one in which the case can most suitably be tried in the interests of the parties and for the ends of justice:&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Vedanta</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#160;at [88]. &#8230; second stage factors may also be relevant to the first stage in what is juridically a single holistic exercise in seeking to identify where the case can most suitably be tried in the interests of the parties and for the ends of justice.&#8221;</span></p>

He signed a letter which was sent to the High Court (addressed to Lavender J and Ritchie J) on 21 October 2024. The letter seeks to dissuade the Court from accepting jurisdiction over these claims, suggesting that it could discourage foreign investment in Bahia. The local judiciary, it says, is perfectly able to offer a solution, and suggestions of corruption and delay are based on erroneous and outdated information. It points out that a decision by an English court could conflict with decisions in the various proceedings in Brazil and suggests that &#8220;the sovereignty of the State of Bahia and Brazil is at risk&#8221;, and that &#8220;an English judge cannot decide on the title of Brazilian lands or the status of a community as Quilombola without violating the Bahia and Brazilian sovereignty&#8221;.

He describes how a firm might assess the viability of a claim such as the present one. He says that &#8220;no win no fee&#8221; arrangements are well accepted in Brazil although it is more usual to charge a retainer fee plus a success fee. He describes how a lawyer would look into the Quilombola issue, which could be very important for the Claimants&#8217; claim for diminution in value of their land. He notes that Article 113 of the Civil Procedure Code enables multiple claimants to be joined if their claims are sufficiently connected, though the number of claimants in a single action may be limited by the judge. He provides more information about the CPA and confirms that its existence does not prevent the making of individual claims. He explains how a claimant in Brazil would go about establishing the liability of an indirect polluter and, in view of the need to establish a causal link between environmental damage and an act or omission of the parent companies and the bureaucratic hurdles of serving proceedings on foreign companies, says that he would recommend that a claimant should not sue the parent companies. If judgment were obtained against BIML and its assets proved insufficient to meet the liability, it could be enforced against the parent companies. Mr Loretti said that if his firm were not conflicted and the claim were shown to have a good chance of success, he would be willing to represent the claimants in Brazil and to investigate the possibility of a &#8220;no win no fee&#8221; arrangement. </span></p>

He says that his experience confirms that the Brazilian judiciary has full competence to deal with such claims and that underprivileged people benefit from free legal services. Distance, he says, is no obstacle, thanks to the widespread use of electronic systems in Brazil. He states that the Public Defender&#8217;s Office in Bahia has &#8220;hundreds of defenders&#8221; who can act for, for example, Quilombola communities. Where these are unavailable, parties can be represented by court-appointed lawyers paid for by the State.

He is a partner in a firm which has worked on cases arising from four major environmental accidents (three in 2009 and one in 2013) which affected thousands of fishermen, many from indigenous populations. He emphasizes the effect of the reversal of the burden of proof in environmental cases, meaning that expert evidence on the existence, causation and impact of damage is paid for by defendants. He views delay in the system as a greater problem than access to justice. He describes how he assesses the feasibility of claims, having regard to matters including the number of people affected. He sets success fees in the order of 20% to 30%. The cost of the work of lawyers is diluted by their working on several cases rather than being exclusively devoted to one matter. </span></p>

He is a Brazilian attorney, law professor, and a partner at a law firm which typically represents large companies in litigation, including mining companies. He describes how he would assess the viability of a lawsuit in Brazil and provides evidence broadly consistent with that already summarised about procedural matters such as joinder and electronic process, and about legal aid, though his experience is that typically, &#8220;an economically insufficient citizen would seek the help of the Public Defender&#8217;s Office&#8221;. His firm is representing a mining company in three lawsuits against indigenous communities who are represented by private attorneys. He feels that it would not be difficult to find private attorneys interested in representing claimants, and notes that he is representing a mining company in a suit filed by an association representing over 100 fishermen in Bahia seeking indemnity for environmental damage, and the association is represented by three private law firms. He emphasizes that a case may be more attractive to claimant lawyers because of the prospect of recovering &#8220;loss of suit fees&#8221; from the other side of 10-20% of the value of the claim. He added that he has also acted in cases where the Public Defender represented the other side. </span></p>

He has been a Brazilian lawyer for over 30 years and founded a law firm in 1997. He has extensive experience in environmental law and his firm has an &#8220;area focused on vulnerable communities affected by socio-environmental damage and human rights abuses&#8221;. He emphasizes the remoteness of places in which claims such as the present claims may arise and the logistical difficulties which this can cause. When his firm is contacted by a community wishing to bring a claim, it will analyse the legal issues and assess the costs. In his experience, collective claims such as CPAs are more common than individual lawsuits. He estimates that for the present claims, a law firm would have to invest about &#163;94,000 per year during the lifetime of the case for items which are not covered by legal aid, and that burdens of this kind often make it unfeasible for a firm to act. </span></p>

He recommended &#8220;a collective or even individual action for homogeneous rights&#8221; on behalf of the community. The distance between his office and Piat&#227; ruled out &#8220;pro bono work or a risk contract with payment at the end of the case&#8221; because of the level of overheads in an environmental damage case. He quoted initial fees but the case could not be taken any further because the Claimants could not afford them. He also felt that the judiciary in Bahia might favour the economic benefits of mining over a claim for environmental damage, and that the CPA will take years or decades and will probably end in BIML being held &#8220;minimally responsible&#8221;. </span></p>

Mr de Natividade considers that face-to-face contact with clients remains necessary in work of this kind.

On a number of assumptions broadly favourable to the Defendants in the litigation (damages per Claimant at a &#8220;mid-point&#8221; of &#163;20,750, litigation disbursements per claim at a &#8220;low&#8221; sum of &#163;12,336.49 based on a grant of &#8220;expenses legal aid&#8221; and a return for solicitors (success fee plus succumbence) of 50% of the damages), the solicitors would make a loss of &#163;205,123.47. </span></p>

Mr Reis considers that a lack of homogeneity of the damage suffered by individual claimants would be a barrier to joinder, or that it would limit the ability of the Judiciary to manage the litigation. His evidence is that in one of Mr Bonatto&#8217;s cases involving 3,000 fishermen bringing small and homogeneous claims, the litigation was organised into 25 claims, each with between 5 and 327 claimants.

Continuation of the injunction, compliance with disclosure orders and acceptance of service of proceedings in Brazil have little if any relevance to the risk that the Claimants will not obtain proper representation in Brazil. The experts do not consider that the Defendants&#8217; co-operation with a legal aid application would be material, and in any event I have made a working assumption that legal aid would be granted. For the Defendants to deal with any translation requirements would presumably reduce the costs/overheads of the claims to a degree, but not to such a degree as to solve the problem of the claims&#8217; economic viability in Brazil. An undertaking to submit to the Brazilian jurisdiction and to make prompt payment of any damages ordered by a Brazilian Court would remove one or two layers of uncertainty in the cost-benefit analysis which a prospective lawyer would conduct, but again would not remove the real risk that no suitable lawyer in Brazil would consider the case economically viable. </span></p>

This was a claim by Zambian citizens of very limited means complaining of damage caused by discharges from a copper mine in Zambia. The second defendant was the Zambian operator of the mine and the first was its English parent company. At first instance, the judge decided at stage 1 that England was the proper place in which to bring the claim, but at stage 2, after consideration of disputed evidence, that there was a real risk (in that case, a probability) that the claimants would not obtain substantial justice in Zambia because there was neither legal aid nor the possibility of CFA representation in Zambia, and that any lawyers in Zambia who would take on the case would lack the necessarily expertise to pursue specialised and complex environmental litigation. The Supreme Court disagreed with the judge&#8217;s conclusion on stage 1, ruling that Zambia was the more natural forum, but agreed with his conclusion on stage 2. That was notwithstanding &#8220;some evidence of group environmental litigation of a similar kind being conducted before the Zambian courts&#8221; (&#167;91) and evidence of &#8220;the possibility of funding cases of this kind, or the necessary underlying research, by contribution from locally based NGOs&#8221; (&#167;93).
