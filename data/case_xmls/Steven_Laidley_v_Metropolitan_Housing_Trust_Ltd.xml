	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Respondent [&#8220;MHT&#8221;] is a social landlord.  By an agreement dated 3 August 2009 MHT granted the Appellant, Mr Laidley, an assured tenancy of a ground floor flat [&#8220;the Flat&#8221;] in a purpose-built block of flats at 57 Yeats Close, London NW10 0BW.  In and from 2018, one of his neighbours complained of persistent banging coming from the Flat.  In 2020 MHT brought proceedings for possession of the Flat relying on grounds 12 and 14 in Schedule 2 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/50" uk:canonical="1988 c. 50" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Housing Act 1988</ref> [&#8220;HA88&#8221;] because of the banging.  Mr Laidley defended the proceedings and brought a counterclaim for disability discrimination.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Though he does not accept that he is mentally ill, Mr Laidley lacks capacity and is disabled for the purposes of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref> [&#8220;EA10&#8221;] because of a delusional disorder.  This has had three consequences for the proceedings.  First, by order of the Court the Official Solicitor has acted on Mr Laidley&#8217;s behalf as his Litigation Friend.  Second, his disability gave rise to considerations of proportionality and potential discrimination that fell to be addressed at trial.  Third, and flowing from the second, Ms Jill Tombs was appointed, at the request of those representing Mr Laidley, to sit with the Judge and act as an assessor pursuant to the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/28" uk:canonical="1984 c. 28" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">County Courts Act 1984</ref> [&#8220;CCA84&#8221;] and EA10.</p>

He also received medical evidence from two expert witnesses who essentially concurred in their diagnosis, one having examined Mr Laidley and the other having conducted a paper-based review.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the opening of the trial, Mr Vanhegan, who acts for Mr Laidley on the instructions of the Official Solicitor, had submitted that the Court should ensure transparency by disclosing to the parties the advice given to the Court by the assessor.  The Trial Judge rejected that submission and, at the conclusion of the trial, made an order for possession.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Laidley raised two appeals to the High Court that are relevant for this judgment.  By the first, he challenged the Trial Judge&#8217;s ruling on the disclosure of the expert assessor&#8217;s advice, in the following terms: &#8220;the Judge was wrong to refuse to provide disclosure of the assessor&#8217;s evidence.  This was a breach of common law procedural fairness and article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. &#8230; The appellant has both an Equality Act defence and counterclaim and therefore the Equality Act issues, and therefore the advice of the assessor, are very important to the determination of a large part of the case.&#8221;  By the second, Mr Laidley alleged that: &#8220;the Judge wrongly used the assessor.  He asked for advice on issues that were not within her competency, and did not seek her advice on the issues that were within her expertise and knowledge.&#8221;  The gist of the complaint was that Ms Tombs did not have expertise and knowledge on the issues of proportionality and legitimate expectation; alternatively, these were questions for the Judge and the assessor&#8217;s role did not include provision of advice about proportionality and legitimate expectation.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appeal was heard by Bacon J who dismissed both grounds of appeal.  In briefest outline, she drew a distinction between (a) a case where the assessor provides what amounts to expert (or other) evidence; and (b) a case where the assessor assists the Court in the evaluation of the evidence in the case.  Broadly speaking, she held that the first category of case could give rise to an obligation to make disclosure to the parties but that the second did not; and she concluded that the present case falls within the latter category, not the former.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Laidley now appeals against Bacon J&#8217;s order.  This second appeal is founded on two grounds, which I shall consider in greater detail later.  In outline, ground 1 asserts that Bacon J was wrong to dismiss the appeal against the Trial Judge&#8217;s refusal to provide disclosure of the assessor&#8217;s evidence.  Ground 2 challenges Bacon J&#8217;s dismissal of Mr Laidley&#8217;s appeal insofar as it challenged the Judge&#8217;s use of the assessor.  The arguments advanced by Mr Laidley on these appeals largely replicate the arguments previously made to and rejected by Bacon J.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before turning to the factual and procedural background, two preliminary points may be made.  First, although it was pleaded on Mr Laidley&#8217;s behalf that the factual requirements for making an order for possession alleged by MHT were not established, Mr Laidley himself provided no evidence; nor was any factual (or other) evidence called on his behalf.  Unsurprisingly, therefore, there is no challenge to any of the primary facts found by the Trial Judge in his detailed and closely reasoned assessment of the facts.   Second, it is not submitted that the Trial Judge&#8217;s judgment discloses any error of law in the assessment of the claim and counterclaim.  The appeal is firmly and only based on what is alleged to have been &#8220;fundamental unfairness&#8221; in the proceedings before the Trial Judge.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Between October 2021 and trial MHT had conducted three Equality and Proportionality Assessments.  The history and findings set out at [18]-[51] of the Trial Judge&#8217;s judgment show MHT attempting virtually any and every conceivable avenue in its efforts to resolve issues in a manner that was suitably supportive of Mr Laidley.  Those avenues included trying to motivate the Local Authority to take responsibility for finding appropriate housing for him, attempts to persuade the local NHS Mental Health and social care service providers to become involved to support him, and repeated attempts to communicate with Mr Laidley himself; all of which avenues proved to be dead-ends until part way through the trial when the senior officer of the LB Brent gave a glimmer of hope that something might be done.  That glimmer provoked an adjournment of the trial part-heard from April to December 2023 by which time the glimmer had not progressed to action on the part of the LB Brent.  The one potentially positive step by LB Brent came in February 2023 when it agreed to allocate a Mental Health Social Worker to Mr Laidley and to carry out a Care Act assessment.  But, as the Judge put it, &#8220;that initiative, sadly, ran entirely into the sand because, as before, Mr Laidley declined to co-operate.&#8221;</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Particulars of Claim pleaded terms of the tenancy including a prohibition on causing anti-social behaviour and nuisance to others. The Re-amended Defence put in issue whether the banging was loud or amounted to a nuisance or annoyance.  It alleged that the problem was inadequate sound insulation.  It averred that Mr Laidley is disabled within the meaning of section 6 of EA10, suffers from delusional disorder and lacks capacity.  By [12] it alleged that MHT was in breach of section 35 of EA10 because it was discriminating against Mr Laidley in the management of the property by serving the notice, bringing the proceedings and seeking to evict the defendant from the Flat.  By [13] it alleged that MHT was in breach of section 15 of EA10 and that the conduct complained of arose in consequence of Mr Laidley&#8217;s disability.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By [14] the Re-amended Defence alleged that MHT&#8217;s actions were indirect discrimination under section 19 of EA10 because, inter alia, MHT could not show that its actions were a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.  Mr Laidley&#8217;s pleaded case on proportionality was that MHT should have fitted proper sound insulation, moved Mr Laidley or his neighbour to alternative accommodation and/or helped Mr Laidley to move to supported accommodation and/or contacted social services and the Community Mental Health Team to enable this to happen.  It is convenient to note at this point that there was no factual substance in these pleaded allegations: the judge found (there being no evidence to the contrary) that MHT had investigated the sound insulation and that there was no evidence of any defects in the sound proofing at the Flat; and the other allegations also failed on the facts.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By [15] the Re-amended Defence acknowledged that MHT had carried out an Equality Act and Public Sector Equality Duty [&#8220;PSED&#8221;] assessment but alleged that it was in breach of the PSED because: (i) the assessment did not take account of the defendant&#8217;s lack of capacity; (ii) the assessment did not take account of the fact that the conduct complained of arose as a consequence of the defendant&#8217;s disability; (iii) the assessment did not take account of the inadequate sound insulation; and (iv) the assessment did not consider moving or helping the defendant to move to suitable alternative accommodation or contacting social services and the CMHT to enable this to happen.  Once again, it is convenient to note at this point that these allegations failed on the facts found by the Trial Judge and there is no challenge to his findings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the Counterclaim, it was alleged that there had been a contravention of section 35, which is in Part 4 of EA10.  On that basis [24] of the Counterclaim alleged that pursuant to section 114(7) of the EA10, the court should exercise its power under section 63(1) of CCA84 to appoint an assessor to assist the court to decide whether there has been a breach of Part 4 and the amount of damages to be awarded under section 119 of the EA10, and whether there has been a breach of the PSED.  By its Reply and Defence to Counterclaim, MHT agreed that an assessor should be appointed.  It is not necessary otherwise to refer to that pleading.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 25 August 2022 HHJ Luba KC directed that the Court would hear the trial &#8220;with an Assessor appointed in accordance with section 114 of [EA10]&#8221;.  The Court was to notify the parties of the name and relevant qualifications of the proposed assessor by 14 February 2023.  The parties would then be entitled to object to the proposed assessor within 7 days.  On 19 December 2022 the Judge varied his order so that the Court was to notify the parties by 11 January 2023 of the identity of the proposed assessor and that the assessor should be someone &#8220;specialising in disability, and particularly issues of mental health.&#8221;  On 25 January 2023 the Court gave notice to the parties that the Judge had considered the matter and had appointed Ms Tombs to sit as an assessor to assist him in trying the action.  Ms Tombs&#8217; CV was attached.  Neither party objected to her appointment; nor has it been suggested then or since that she was not in general terms suitably qualified to sit as an assessor and to assist the Trial Judge in trying this case.  </p>

Reasonableness not only embraces a consideration of proportionality in that sense, but also deals with wider matters.  The Court is required to consider all relevant circumstances including, for example in this case, matters such as the medical condition of the defendant and whether the claimant Trust has, as a public body, complied with relevant policies and procedures.  But something more than simple reasonableness and human rights proportionality is required where the context is one of a protected characteristic, protected by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref>.

The relevant protected characteristic in this case is the characteristic of disability.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 6</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> defines disability as applying where a person has a physical or mental impairment and the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on that person&#8217;s ability to carry out normal day to day activities.  Where a person has that characteristic there is special protection from discrimination provided by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.  That provides that a person discriminates against a disabled person if they treat the disabled person unfavourably because of something arising in consequence of the disabled person&#8217;s disability, and they cannot show that such treatment is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.  A person with the protected characteristic of disability is also entitled to advance a contention that they have been the victim of other forms of discrimination, including indirect discrimination defined by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/19" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 19</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.

Suffice it to say that Mr Laidley in this case contends that he is a victim of the indirect discrimination there defined.  The prohibition on the discrimination defined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> applies to those who manage premises by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/35" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 35</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/35/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 35(1)</ref>(b) expressly provides that managers of premises must not discriminate against individuals by evicting them or taking steps for the purposes of their eviction.  </p>

Then, having held that the requisite notice had been served so that the Court had jurisdiction, the Judge dealt in turn with sections entitled (a) &#8220;Are the Grounds Made Out?&#8221; ([54]-[68]); (b) &#8220;Reasonableness&#8221; [69]-[73]; (c) &#8220;Proportionality&#8221; [74]-[83]; (d) &#8220;The Counterclaim&#8221; [84]-[86]; and (e) &#8220;Outcome&#8221; [87].  In terms of structure it need only be noted that, consistently with his summary of principle at [15] of the Judgment (which I have set out at [23] above), he considered not only whether it would be reasonable to order possession if it were an &#8220;ordinary&#8221; case but also (under the heading of proportionality) to consider whether MHT had shown the necessary &#8220;something more&#8221;.  In doing so, he considered Mr Laidley&#8217;s case that MHT had not followed and applied the PSED set out in section 149 of EA10, concluding that MHT had engaged with and complied with the PSED and, if he were wrong about that, any shortcomings in its compliance with the PSED would not affect the ultimate outcome.  He then considered whether making a possession order would be proportionate and in pursuit of a legitimate aim, concluding that it would.  Turning to the Counterclaim, he assumed that all steps under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 15</ref> and 19 up to the last were satisfied and, in relation to the last (namely whether MHT could show that the treatment was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim), for reasons given, concluded that they had done so.  </p>

That is because it is recognised that all findings of fact were supported by the evidence adduced by the parties and were findings that the Judge was entitled to make; and there were no material issues left unaddressed.  I would go further and say that his conclusions on the various issues that he addressed, clearly and thoroughly set out as they were, flowed inexorably from the findings of primary fact that he had made, which were themselves based on compelling and uncontradicted evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At trial, MHT had accepted that Mr Laidley had a disability, diagnosed as a delusional disorder, and that his disability was the cause of his anti-social behaviour.  The Trial Judge was &#8220;amply satisfied&#8221; (at [68]) that the banging on the wall was to such extent and with such frequency that it amounted to conduct which breached the tenancy agreement and was also a nuisance within the terms of Ground 14.  In response to Mr Vanhegan&#8217;s submission that, even if he had made a finding of nuisance, nevertheless it was not a nuisance of such a quality as to make the granting of a possession order reasonable, the Trial Judge described the anti-social behaviour (at [69]) as &#8220;regular, consistent, disruptive noise, taking place in the early hours of the morning, at night and throughout the day.  This is certainly not insignificant.  I consider it would amply justify the making of a possession order in a context where, unless a possession order is granted, the noise is not going to stop.&#8221;  However, before reaching his concluded view, he had regard to other case-specific features including (a) that the neighbour victim was already elderly and ill; (b) an alleged absence or inadequacy of MHT&#8217;s published policies; (c) the factually incorrect allegation that MHT had not investigated or resolved an issue of sound insulation; (d) a suggestion that MHT should have considered transferring Mr Laidley, which he rejected because, on the evidence, MHT had considered transferring him but Mr Laidley had not engaged; and (e) a suggestion that MHT had not contacted the relevant statutory support agencies which, on his findings, was &#8220;wholly unfounded.&#8221;</p>

The passage from [74]-[83], where he considered whether the grant of a possession order would be a proportionate outcome to the pursuit of a legitimate aim and concluded that it would be, was a closely reasoned section that was humanely sympathetic to Mr Laidley, as was the Judgment as a whole.  As with his other findings, there is no challenge to his conclusion.  He set out and answered each of the submissions made on Mr Laidley&#8217;s behalf.  The judgment is characterised throughout by thorough understanding and analysis suitably informed and balanced by a clear appreciation of Mr Laidley&#8217;s difficulties.</p>

On Ground 1 she reviewed the authorities upon which the parties relied, to which I will refer in more detail later.  She correctly identified that there was no universal rule as to the nature of the assistance that an assessor will provide to the Court and the extent to which disclosure of their advice and evidence might be required.  That said, she drew a distinction between cases where the assessor performs &#8220;an evidential function&#8221; in the proceedings (in respect of which disclosure would be the normal rule) and cases where the assessor&#8217;s contribution would simply be to assist the judge in understanding or evaluating the evidence provided by the parties (in respect of which disclosure would not normally be required unless fairness required it in the particular circumstances).  In the present case it was common ground that Mr Laidley was disabled and that the conduct complained of was caused at least in part by his disability.  Accordingly:</p>

She also recorded Mr Vanhegan&#8217;s acceptance that the assessment of proportionality by the judge was a mixed question of fact and law, which involved weighing up the facts and evidence before the court.  That was an exercise which this assessor was well-qualified to assist, as a long-serving member of the Employment Tribunals, with experience of handling disputes involving discrimination allegations.  The Judge made the pertinent observation that neither side had taken any issue with the suitability of the assessor at the time.  Pointing out that the judge had a wide discretion regarding the use to which an Equality Assessor is put, the Judge held that there was no procedural unfairness whether the Trial Judge had or had not relied upon assistance from the assessor when considering and determining proportionality issues in relation to MHT&#8217;s PSED.  </p>

But it need not be limited to that; and, as we shall see in a moment, the role of an assessor in certain contexts has long been recognised as going beyond evaluation of the evidence adduced by the parties, to the extent of the assessor being regarded as a Court-appointed expert.  The fact that in some well-recognised contexts an assessor will be required to give evidence supports the proposition that the discretion of the court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/28/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref> of CCA84 and CPR35.15(3) can extend to asking the assessor to provide evidence in addition to the evidence adduced by the parties.

They are authority for the proposition that, where an assessor gives expert evidence, that must be transparently disclosed to the parties.  But that proposition is so fundamental that no authority is really needed for it.  Subject to one reservation, I would not accept that Christopher Clarke LJ&#8217;s reference to &#8220;observations filed with a view to influencing the court&#8217;s decision&#8221; either said or meant that whenever an assessor assists the Court in its evaluation of the evidence provided by the parties the content of that evaluative process needs to be disclosed to the parties.  The one reservation that I would add is that if the contribution of the assessor leads the Court into an area or argument that would affect its decision and of which the parties have not had notice in any event, the fundamental principle of fairness may require that contribution to be disclosed so that the parties may meet the case as now being considered.  This reservation is in accordance with what I understand to be the proper approach if a Court (however constituted) comes up with a new line of potentially influential argument after closing submissions have concluded.  In such circumstances I consider it to be axiomatic that the parties should be given a proportionate opportunity to consider the new line of argument and to make submissions if so advised.</p>

A medical assessor intimated a wish to assess a Workmen&#8217;s Compensation Act claimant and, having carried out a medical examination in private out of court, communicated his views based on his examination to the Judge who based his decision on that expert evidence without informing the parties of its content.  The decision was set aside on the basis that the Judge should have informed the parties of the advice he had received.  So far as relevant to this case, it is an example of an assessor who goes beyond providing evaluative assistance and provides expert evidence that is material to the outcome.  </p>

The court may also direct that the assessor &#8216;attend the whole or any part of the trial to advise the court on any such matter.&#8217; The absence of any suggestion that any advice must be revealed to the parties in contrast to the position where a report is directed, would indicate that even in the CPR 35.15 context, it is not envisaged, at any rate as a matter of course, that advice will be revealed in order to allow the parties to make submissions on it. </p>

It will depend on how far assessors are fulfilling an evidential role and how far simply assisting in the decision making process, and of course a judge will have in mind at all times what fairness to the parties requires. </p>

Where assessors are appointed under CPR 35.15, the court has a broad discretion on how to use the same and the type of assistance they give may vary widely, dependent upon the character of the litigation. They may have an evidential function (in which event disclosure to the parties will be the normal rule) and a function which is more involved in assisting the evaluation of evidence (in which event disclosure to the parties will not be the normal rule and only occur if fairness demands it).&#8221;</p>

Furthermore assessors, despite their primary role, may provide a piece of information akin to expert evidence, and here, once again disclosure should be made.

Making all due allowance for the fact that, at the time, assessors appointed under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/74/section/67/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 67(4)</ref> of RRA formed a distinct category of their own, the basic reasons (based on fairness) for appointing assessors under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/74/section/67/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 67(4)</ref> and under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/28/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref> of CCA84 are the same: to supply the experience and expertise that the Court may otherwise lack in its evaluation of the case in hand.

The Judge rejected that submission and, in my judgment, he was right to do so.  The initial impetus for the appointment of the assessor came from Mr Laidley&#8217;s Counterclaim, was agreed by MHT, and was implemented by the Court as set out above.  That provided sufficient &#8220;definition&#8221; both of the original reasons for appointing an assessor and of the chosen assessor&#8217;s experience and expertise.  Given that the primary role of an assessor in a case such as this is to provide assistance in the evaluation of the evidence, no further definition was necessary; and attempting to define the relevant issues more closely would run the risk of constraining the scope and limiting the usefulness of the role that the assessor could undertake.  It was then for the Judge to be astute to recognise if the assessor strayed outside the proper limits of her involvement either by purporting to assist on areas where she had no relevant experience or expertise, or by giving evidence, or by acting in such a way as to open a new line of enquiry of which the parties had not had proper notice and a fair opportunity to respond.  There is no sign that any of these possible mishaps happened in the present case and no reason to speculate that they either did or might have done.</p>

And, if the Judge is in doubt as to the requirements of fairness, they can and should lean towards disclosure so that no risk of unfairness remains.  I also note Mr Vanhegan&#8217;s concession that an assessor should seldom if ever be treated as having given evidence simply because they refer to their experience in the course of discussions.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ground 2 asserts that the trial judge &#8220;asked the assessor about proportionality and legitimate aim&#8221; and that these were matters upon which the assessor could not assist the Judge as she was &#8220;not at all placed to weigh the competing interests of the disabled person with those of the housing association.&#8221;  It also asserts that the Trial Judge decided the defence based on the PSED &#8220;apparently without any reference to the assessor.&#8221;  In support of this latter proposition it is submitted that &#8220;the PSED is not about proportionality&#8221; so that the Trial Judge&#8217;s statement that the assessor assisted on the issue of proportionality does not mean that she had any input on the issues that arose under the PSED.  It is said that the effect of these actions was that the appellant did not know the case he had to meet.   It is also asserted that there is no certainty that the assessor did not stray beyond &#8220;pure advice to help the judge evaluate the evidence.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Oral submissions for the appellant on this ground were made tenaciously by Ms Smith.  Despite her efforts, I am not persuaded that there is any substance in Ground 2.  Although, as I have said, there is no basis for speculating that the assessor strayed beyond the primary role of assisting in the evaluation of evidence, we do not (and should not) know precisely what the extent of that assistance was.  All that can be said is that the Judge had a broad discretion to decide precisely what assistance he needed or wanted.  Given the considerable experience of Ms Tombs as revealed by her CV and the fact that no objection was taken to her appointment at the time, I can see no basis for assuming or speculating that she contributed to the evaluation of the case inappropriately or strayed beyond her proper areas of experience and expertise.  Specifically, nothing in [10]-[11] of the Trial Judge&#8217;s judgment demonstrates that the assistance provided by the assessor was inappropriate. Although the PSED defence raised separate issues, Bacon J was correct to say that the central disputed question was the proportionality of MHT&#8217;s actions in relation to Mr Laidley and that the question was relevant to his Defence and Counterclaim alleging discrimination contrary to various provisions of EA10.  Turning to the PSED, the Trial Judge was entitled to take the view that the PSED assessments raised proportionality issues.  I can see no reason to conclude that the assessor was not able to contribute to issues of proportionality.  At the same time, whether and the extent to which she was asked to contribute was a matter for the Judge.  It would, in my judgment, be unjustifiably over-prescriptive to hold that the Judge was either obliged to seek her assistance or obliged not to.  This case is a paradigm example of one where the assistance required and sought by the judge is for the judge to determine; and it will be for the judge to decide whether the contribution of the assessor is helpful or not.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I return again to the terms of CPR 52.21(3).  The appellant&#8217;s submissions on Ground 2 do not demonstrate that the substantive decision of the Trial Judge was wrong; nor do they disclose any procedural irregularity, let alone one that renders the Trial Judge&#8217;s decision unjust.  I would therefore dismiss the appeal on Ground 2.</p>
