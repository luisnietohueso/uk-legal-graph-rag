But as we shall see, the application of the ECtHR and CJEU case-law is not hard-edged. It requires an assessment of the likely shape of the proposed litigation and the individual's ability to have effective access to justice in relation to it. The Director may conclude that he cannot decide whether there would be a breach of the individual's Convention or EU rights. In that event, he is not required by section 10(3)(a) to make a determination. He must then go on to consider whether it is appropriate to make a determination under section 10(3)(b). In making that decision, he should have regard to <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> risk that failure to make a determination would be a breach. These words mean exactly what they say. The greater he assesses the risk to be, the more likely it is that he will consider it to be appropriate to make a determination. That is because, if the risk eventuates, there will be a breach. But the seriousness of the risk is only one of the factors that the Director may take into account in deciding whether it is appropriate to make a determination.

It observes in this regard that in submitting their complaints in accordance with the procedures laid down in the 1976 and 1989 Acts, the applicants were seeking a ruling that they had been denied the opportunity to compete for and obtain work on the basis of their abilities and competitiveness alone and to be given security clearance for this purpose without regard to their religious beliefs or political opinions. Had it been established that the applicants were indeed the victims of unlawful discrimination, the county court in the case of Tinnelly and the Fair Employment Tribunal in the case of the McElduffs were ultimately empowered under the 1976 and 1989 Acts to assess the extent of the applicants&#8217; loss and order financial reparation in their favour including for direct and indirect loss of profits. The fact that the contracts at issue were public procurement contracts or that the applicants&#8217; offers were never accepted cannot prevent that right from being considered a &#8220;civil right&#8221; for the purposes of Article 6(1).&#8221;</p>

It also found that, where a State confers rights which can be enforced by means of a judicial remedy, these can, in principle, be regarded as civil rights within the meaning of Article 6 &#167; 1 (see, along the same lines, <span style="font-style:italic">Tinnelly &amp; Sons Ltd and Others and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom</span>, 10 July 1998, &#167; 61, <span style="font-style:italic">Reports of Judgments and Decisions</span> 1998-IV).</p>

It may or may not be. But it is for the Secretary of State to show that the discrimination is justified. Given that the Ministry has not addressed the possible impacts upon women, assessed whether there is a disadvantage, how significant it is and what might be done to mitigate it or to meet the particular circumstances of women offenders, it cannot show that the present distribution of APs for women is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.&#8221;</p>

Public law is often concerned with the process by which a decision is taken and not with the substance of that decision. This is for at least two reasons. First, good processes are more likely to lead to better informed, and therefore better, decisions. Secondly, whatever the outcome, good processes help to make public authorities accountable to the public. We would add, in the particular context of the PSED, that the duty helps to reassure members of the public, whatever their race or sex, that their interests have been properly taken into account before policies are formulated or brought into effect.&#8221;</p>

The underlying premise of the article was that all existing member states of the Council of Europe had, and all future member states would have, an established system of state education. It was intended to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to that system by those within the jurisdiction of the respective states. The fundamental importance of education in a modern democratic state was recognised to require no less. But the guarantee is, in comparison with most other Convention guarantees, a weak one, and deliberately so. There is no right to education of a particular kind or quality, other than that prevailing in the state. There is no Convention guarantee of compliance with domestic law. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">There is no Convention guarantee of education at or by a particular institution. There is no Convention objection to the expulsion of a pupil from an educational institution on disciplinary grounds, unless (in the ordinary way) there is no alternative source of state education open to the pupil</span> (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Eren v Turkey</span> (Application No 60856/00) (unreported) 7 February 2006). The test, as always under the Convention, is a highly pragmatic one, to be applied to the specific facts of the case: have the authorities of the state acted so as to deny to a pupil effective access to such educational facilities as the state provides for such pupils? &#8230;&#8221;</p>

I am unable to accept that for four main and to some extent overlapping reasons which individually and cumulatively lead me to that conclusion. First, there is no suggestion whatsoever in the contentions put before the Panel or in the claim form that V&#8217;s personal relationships have been interfered with in such a way whatsoever by his exclusion from the School. In other words this case was totally different from those of the claimants in <span style="font-style:italic">Wright</span>&#8217;s case. Second V has not wanted to return to the School and that decision undermines an Article 8 claim. </p>

Indeed, the Court of Appeal flatly rejected the argument that Article 8 was engaged by a child&#8217;s exclusion from school and Sedley LJ with whom Hughes and Ward LJJ agreed, explained that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I am unable to accept that the want of meaningful educational provision at home during the material period, undesirable though it was, can have amounted to a violation of A&#8217;s right to respect for his private or family life</span>&#8221; <span style="font-style:italic">A v Essex County Council</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 364 [24].

So far as the basis for intervention by a court is concerned, we respectfully consider that Lord Bridge and Lord Templeman were correct in their analysis that it is not a matter of rationality, but rather that the court will intervene when a public authority has, by issuing a policy, positively authorised or approved unlawful conduct by others. In that sort of case, it can be said that the public authority has acted unlawfully by undermining the rule of law in a direct and unjustified way. In this limited but important sense, public authorities have a general duty not to induce violations of the law by others.&#8221;</p>

As we explain in our judgment in the <span style="font-style:italic">A </span>case, the meaning of the formula used by Lord Scarman is much narrower than suggested by Mr Hermer. It involves comparing two normative statements, one being the underlying legal position and the other being the direction in the policy guidance, to see if the latter contradicts the former. Mr Hermer&#8217;s submission as to the effect of <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span> distorts this test by comparing a normative statement with a factual prediction, ie comparing the underlying legal position with what might happen in fact if the persons to whom the policy guidance is directed are given no further information. If correct, this would involve imposing on the person promulgating the guidance a very different, and far more extensive, obligation than that discussed in <span style="font-style:italic">Gillick</span>. It would transform the obligation from one not to give a direction which conflicts with the legal duty of the addressee into an obligation to promulgate a policy which removes the risk of possible misapplication of the law on the part of those who are subject to a legal duty. There is no general duty of that kind at common law. </p>

That is inherent in the nature of law, and the remedy is to have access to the courts to compel that person to act in accordance with their duty. An asylum seeker has the same right to apply to the courts as anyone else. Save in specific contexts of a kind discussed below and in our judgment in the <span style="font-style:italic">A</span> case, there is no obligation for a Minister or anyone else to issue policy guidance in an attempt to eliminate uncertainty in relation to the application of a stipulated legal rule. Any such obligation would be extremely far-reaching and difficult (if not impossible in many cases) to comply with. It would also conflict with fundamental features of the separation of powers. It would require Ministers to take action to amplify and to some degree restate rules laid down in legislation, whereas it is for Parliament to choose the rules which it wishes to have applied. And it would inevitably involve the courts in assessing whether Ministers had done so sufficiently, thereby requiring courts to intervene to an unprecedented degree in the area of legislative choice and to an unprecedented degree in the area of executive decision-making in terms of control of the administrative apparatus through the promulgation of policy.&#8221;</p>

The decision was concerned with the introduction of an order imposing fees to bring claims in an employment tribunal, but the principles stated are of general application. The test applied was whether the making of the order created &#8220;a real risk that persons will effectively be prevented from having access to justice&#8221; (para 87; see also para 85, where <span style="font-style:italic">R (Hillingdon London Borough Council) v Lord Chancellor (Law Society intervening)</span> [2009] 1 FLR 39 is referred to as authority for such a test).&#8221;</p>

In particular, the Claimant did not contend that Article 6 (or the procedural requirements of Article 8 or Article 2 of Protocol 1) will always be engaged in such proceedings and the Director did not contend that they will never be engaged in such proceedings.

The Director did not simply follow that guidance, but instead considered relevant authorities, i.e. <span style="font-style:italic">Tom Hood School</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Or&#353;u&#353; v Croatia</span>.

It could, for instance, have confined itself to deciding that the GDC had, or had not, properly addressed the allegation of discrimination.  However, I consider that a decision by the review panel that the GDC decision should be quashed because XWJ&#8217;s exclusion  had been unlawful by reason of discrimination contrary to section 85(2)(e) of the Equality Act would have been directly decisive for the purposes of Article 6(1).</p>

The review panel was obliged by section 51A(4)(c) of the Education Act 2002 to consider the GDC decision in the light of the principles applicable on an application for judicial review, which involved considering any allegation (if made) that the head teacher had acted unlawfully by discriminating against XWJ.  Moreover, any such decision made by the review panel would have been binding on the head teacher and the governing body, pursuant to regulation 25(6) of the 2012 Regulations.  It is difficult to see how it can be said that a decision made by the review panel which was both within its jurisdiction and binding on the parties would not have been decisive.</p>

Subsection 113(1) makes that jurisdiction exclusive, but that is subject, inter alia, to subsection 113(3)(a), which provides that subsection 113(1) does not apply to a claim for judicial review.  Section 51A(4) of the Education Act 2002 then provides that the review panel was obliged to consider the GDC decision in the light of the principles applicable on an application for judicial review, which, as I have said, clearly involved considering whether the exclusion decision was unlawful by reason of discrimination.  </p>

Although matters were referred to in the review panel proceedings which might be said to be relevant to the right conferred by Article 8: there was no allegation that there had been a violation of Article 8; the review panel made no decision whether or not there had been a violation of Article 8; and the Claimant did not contend, in her application for judicial review of the review panel&#8217;s decision, that the review panel had omitted to address an issue which had been raised before it.</p>

The review request and the letter before action did not provide any such explanation.  On the contrary, the letter before action enclosed the review panel&#8217;s decision, from which it could be seen that the review panel had not made a decision whether or not there had been a violation of Article 8.   </p>
