Further, she averred that in March 2020 a younger person than her, NV, was employed at &#163;24.71 per hour to replace a colleague who had left in February 2020, and who, before leaving, had been paid &#163;12 per hour for the same work which NV was then employed to do. The appellant herself had taken on an additional role for which RG had refused her request for a salary increase. The ET1 records the respondents&#8217; explanation for this as being that NV was employed under Grade 5 while the appellant merely Grade 1. It seems from her averments that the whilst the appellant may agree that such grades were ascribed to her and NV respectively, she did not accept that there was any substantive difference between her work and that carried out by NV. </span></p>

Those were allegations of rudeness and unprofessional conduct. The appellant set out &#8211; at considerable length &#8211; her reasons for disputing the veracity of those allegations. It is clear from this section of the paper apart to the ET1 that the appellant was not simply suggesting that she disputed the allegations themselves. She was also suggesting that the allegations were not the true (or only) reason for her dismissal. In particular, at page 4 of the paper apart, she stated:</span></p>

He noted that that the second respondent, which is a subsidiary of the first respondent, provided work which the appellant carried out from 27 May 2019 as a Grade 1 administrator. (ET &#167; 7).  The appellant was apparently a hard worker and conscientious (ET &#167; 8). Part of her role was to ingather time-sheets from other employees, some of whom were slow in submitting them (ET &#167; 9). Concerns were expressed that the tone of the appellant&#8217;s communications when chasing up time sheets was peremptory and rude (ET &#167; 10). In particular, RG found the appellant&#8217;s style of communication to be unprofessional and raised this with her (ET &#167; 11 and 12). After months of &#8220;escalating difficulties of this kind&#8221; RG contacted human resources and said that he wanted to bring the appellant&#8217;s employment to an end because of her unprofessional conduct and lack of teamwork. The appellant was then summarily dismissed in October 2020 (ET &#167; 13). Thus far, the &#8220;basic facts&#8221; recorded by the judge largely reflect the respondent&#8217;s position as to its reason for dismissing the appellant as set out in paragraph 2.4 of its response form (ET3).</span></p>

That is necessarily implicit in the suggestion that RG was allowed to dismiss her &#8220;under false pretences&#8221; and in the appellant&#8217;s references to how she claims RG treated women and, in particular, older women in the office. The judge seems to have failed to recognise that a disputed issue of fact was whether the appellant&#8217;s sex or age played any part in the decision to dismiss her. That was an issue that could not properly have been determined only on the papers. </span></p>

Even after the equal pay complaint pursuant to section 66 </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">EqA </span><span style="font-size:12pt">was withdrawn, the appellant could still potentially rely upon the protected characteristic of age in relation to a pay differential.
