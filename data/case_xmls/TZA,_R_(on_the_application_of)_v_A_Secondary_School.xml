	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an appeal against a decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Church, sitting as a High Court Judge, dismissing a claim for judicial review arising out of the permanent exclusion of a 15-year old boy from his secondary school.  The child was of black Caribbean heritage and had special educational needs (&#8220;SEN&#8221;).  The claim is brought by his mother.  An anonymity order was made in the High Court in order to protect the identity of the child, and when Newey LJ gave permission to appeal he made an equivalent order as regards the proceedings in this Court.  Accordingly, the mother has been anonymised as &#8220;TZA&#8221; (though in this judgment I will call her &#8220;the Claimant&#8221;), the son as &#8220;TZB&#8221; and the Defendant as &#8220;the School&#8221;.  The Claimant has been represented before us by Ms Stephanie Harrison KC, Mr Ollie Persey and Ms Nadia O&#8217;Mara<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>and the Defendant by Mr Tom Cross.  All four counsel also appeared before the Judge.</p>

It is not quite so straightforward as regards disability because there was no evidence in this case either that the exclusion rate for disabled pupils is disproportionately high or that TZB suffers from a disability within the meaning of the 2010 Act.  But Ms Harrison contended that special educational needs will typically be the result of a mental health condition amounting to a disability, and that the disproportionate exclusion rates for pupils with SEN can be treated as implying a disproportionate rate also for pupils with a disability.  She told us that the case had proceeded below, without challenge, on the basis that TZB&#8217;s acknowledged special educational needs were the result of a mental health condition amounting to a disability and that that fact, as well as his Caribbean ethnicity, engaged section 149.  Mr Cross did not dispute that, so I will say no more about the point, which in any event does not affect the actual issues that we have to decide.</p>

It is one thing to say that, in the light of the disproportionate exclusion rates for high-risk pupils, section 149 (1) (b) requires schools to consider early intervention and other policies for such pupils which may reduce the risk of them behaving in a way which may lead to exclusion.  But the situation is different where such behaviour has in fact occurred, and the school is having to decide whether a pupil should be permanently excluded.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I see some force in that point.  There will certainly be cases where the seriousness of the pupil&#8217;s conduct and/or the harm to the school of allowing them to remain will be such that it can make no difference that they belong to a high-risk group or that they may have received inadequate support in the past.  It may be, if schools truly treat permanent exclusion as a last resort, that those cases will be the great majority.  However, it would be wrong to treat the <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">two-fold test as entirely definitive or entirely hard-edged.  For one thing, it sets a minimum threshold for permanent exclusion: it does not say that in every case where it is met the pupil must be excluded.  For another, &#8220;serious&#8221; is an imprecise term requiring a judgment by the decision-maker which can properly involve considerations of proportionality and extenuating circumstances.  For a third, we are concerned with guidance rather than legislation.  There is therefore room in principle for schools to take into account the fact (if established) that a pupil has received inadequate support in the past, though the extent to which it can make a difference will depend on the circumstances of the case.</span></p>

The high-risk groups identified in para. 21 of the Guidance do not consist only of pupils with protected characteristics within the meaning of the 2010 Act; and if in breach of para. 22 such a pupil has received inadequate support in the past that would in principle be a relevant factor in an exclusion decision irrespective of the PSED.  I say this not in order to downplay the importance of the PSED generally but because I am concerned that an undue focus on it may risk over-complicating, and over-legalising, the decision-making process in exclusion cases<span style="color:#000000">.</span></p>

The first assault occurred following a text interchange with the victim the previous day.  TZB arranged to meet him at lunchtime in the toilets and, with another student, punched him several times and then kicked him in the face while he was on the ground.  The second assault occurred just outside the school at the end of the day as students were leaving.  The victim was a student who had intervened to stop the earlier assault.  The principal assault was committed by an &#8220;outsider&#8221; whom TZB had engaged to attack the victim, but TZB was also directly involved.</p>

The most recent exclusion, for threatening behaviour and serious violence, had been on 29 March 2021, i.e. only six weeks previously.  He was excluded for five days and warned on his return that, as the letter put it, &#8220;any repeat of such behaviour placed him at imminent risk of permanent exclusion&#8221;.  There had already been four other disciplinary incidents in March 2021, the most recent of which had consisted of TZB using social media to incite revenge and violence, leading to a &#8220;physical altercation&#8221; with two other students.

In the event it permitted such representations, but I need to identify the basis on which it did so.  The Claimant believed that the parts of the IRP&#8217;s decision relating to the PSED were wrong in law, and JFKL wrote a pre-action protocol letter threatening proceedings on that basis, in which the IRP would be a defendant and the School would be an interested party.  In response the School made clear that it would have no objection to the GDC including the PSED issue in the reconsideration which it was obliged to carry out in any event in the light of the IRP&#8217;s other criticisms; and on that basis the Claimant decided not to proceed with its proposed claim.  Although we do not have full details, it appears that it was agreed, not only between the Claimant and the School but also with the GDC, that the GDC would entertain written submissions and also that Mr Persey and Mr Wilkins could attend its meeting in order to give it further assistance on the PSED question only.  </p>

The school population, as one would expect, includes pupils with a wide variety of aptitudes, abilities and disabilities, and the School has a dedicated Inclusion Faculty. It is clear (and would have been clear to the GDC at the time of making both of its decisions) that the Headteacher was well aware both of TZB&#8217;s ethnicity and of his special educational needs and the support that had been provided to him in this regard.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Harrison&#8217;s first submission in response was that the fact that the decisions of the Headteacher and the GDC were to be regarded in law as part of a single process did not mean that a legal error by the Headteacher at the first stage could be cured by proper consideration at the second.  Para. 71 of the Guidance requires the governors to consider &#8220;whether [the headteacher&#8217;s] decision to exclude the pupil was lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair&#8221;, and the GDC had indeed at the start of the first meeting identified that as the first question that it had to consider.  If it found that the Headteacher had acted unlawfully by failing to have regard to the PSED it was obliged to reinstate.  Any other approach would deprive the duty on the Headteacher of any real content and would be contrary to what Parliament intended.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not accept that submission.  The whole object of the procedure required by regulation 24 is to ensure that the governors are in a position to make for themselves the ultimate decision as to whether exclusion is required.  The provision for a meeting and for representations by all the interested parties, including the local authority, means that they will almost certainly be in a better position than the headteacher to assess the matters specified in sub-paragraph (3) (a).  The representations may cover matters of which the headteacher was unaware at the time of the original decision, and we were told that that is not uncommon.  It would make no sense if the fact that the governors detect an error in the headteacher&#8217;s decision-making (which will have been without the benefit of the material available to them) meant that their only option was to reinstate the pupil even if it was in fact clear that the exclusion was fully justified.  It is, as Sedley LJ says, wrong to regard the role of the GDC as being simply to review the decision of the headteacher for legality and rationality.</p>

In the first place, it is couched in terms of &#8220;should&#8221; and not &#8220;must&#8221;, guidance (see para. 10 above).  But in any event its effect is only to make clear that if the governors consider that the headteacher&#8217;s decision was lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair, taking account of the evidence that they have heard, they should uphold that decision.  It does not say anything about what they should do if they find that it was flawed.  No doubt if they find that it was unreasonable, or absolutely unlawful, they would have to reinstate.  But if they find that it was procedurally unfair, or unlawful only because of some error in the decision-making processes, nothing in the paragraph suggests that they cannot proceed to make their own decision, applying procedural fairness and on a correct legal basis; and regulation 24 (3) (a) requires that they should.  </p>

She relied on a criticism made by the IRP at para. 8.5 of its decision about the GDC&#8217;s consideration of the level of support received by TZB.    I shall have to return to that later in connection with ground (B) (see para. 104 below), but subject to that I can say that I see no basis for any conclusion that in taking its decision not to reinstate him or its later reconsideration of that decision (which is ultimately what matters), the GDC failed to take the PSED into account.  At the first meeting it had been reminded of it explicitly by both KM and the local authority and it had referred to it in terms in its own reasons (see para. 10.10 of the minutes).  At the reconsideration meeting it was the entire focus of the submissions of JFKL and Mr Persey and it was extensively referred to in the relevant minutes: see paras. 56-57 above.</p>

But the Judge found that the reference in that minute to &#8220;written evidence&#8221; was to the minutes of the earlier meeting.  That being so, the GDC was aware that there was no contemporaneous written evidence of the kind that the Claimant was then contending was necessary: rather, it was relying on the record of what the Headteacher had told them at the meeting.  Her statement that she had in fact had regard to the requirements of the Act was evidence on which it was entitled to rely.</p>

His reasoning in the paragraphs which I have quoted correctly begins with the proposition that what section 149 (1) requires depends on the context.  He rightly emphasised that the decision in this case was an individual decision affecting a single pupil: cf my observations at paras. 22-24 above.  His point that the Headteacher was, and would have been known by the GDC to be, very familiar with the disproportionate exclusion rate for pupils with TZB&#8217;s characteristics, and the impact that exclusion would necessarily have on him, is important and apposite.  He considered that what she then needed to do was to consider whether, taking that factor into account, it was nevertheless right to exclude him in the light of the seriousness of the misconduct found and the harm that would be done by allowing him to remain as a pupil: if that was done the PSED would be satisfied.  That was in my view a sensible and correct approach.</p>

The proper focus for the decision-takers in this case, and thus also the focus of any challenge to their decision, was on an assessment of the individual circumstances of TZB&#8217;s case &#8211; what he had done, the risk of harm to others (and to him) if he remained at the School, and any other particular features of his case (which might in principle include the fact that he came from a group which was at disproportionate risk of exclusion and/or any failures in his past support &#8211; though as to this see paras. 22-24 above).  Packaging the necessary assessment as a compliance with the requirements of the PSED adds nothing of substance.</p>

As regards the other concerns, it was her case that the exercise carried out by the Judge in paras. 91-94 of his judgment as regards concerns (i)-(iv) was illegitimate.  He was not identifying reasons actually given by the GDC for why the IRC&#8217;s concerns did not lead it to change its decision but reasons why in his opinion it was unnecessary for it to do so.  That could not repair the GDC&#8217;s failure to give its own reasons.  Given the role of the IRP as the independent monitor of school exclusion decisions, it was essential that a GDC undertaking a reconsideration in response to a IRP decision should give reasons for each and every point of concern raised.  As regards concern (v), the position was rather different since the Judge identified passages in the minutes which he said adequately addressed the IRP&#8217;s point; but she submitted that they did not in fact do so.  She referred us to the <span style="font-style:italic">XYZ</span> case (see para. 50 above) in order to show the degree of detail in which the governors in that case had given their reasons for maintaining their original decision.  She also referred to a decision of Mr Philip Mott QC in <span style="font-style:italic">R (AT and BT) v London Borough of Barnet</span> [2019] EWHC 3404 (Admin), in which he said that cogent reasons would be required for a local authority not following a recommendation of the First-tier Tribunal (Special Educational Needs and Disability).  </p>

I can see that it might have been respectful to the IRP, and perhaps also a good discipline, for it to have done so; but I see no reason to depart from the usual approach summarised at para. 88 above.  If the concerns raised by the IRC were irrelevant, or of only marginal significance, to the decision whether TZB should be reinstated, a failure to address them specifically cannot invalidate the decision itself.  It is relevant in this connection that, as I have already noted, the IRP itself produced no definitive list of the concerns which it believed the GDC should address.  Section 8 includes a variety of critical observations about the previous process of varying degrees of significance, some of which are indeed too trivial to have been included in the agreed summary at all.  The GDC was obliged to give only such reasons as showed why the substance of the criticisms raised by the IRP had not caused it to alter its decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the first place, the Headteacher&#8217;s position on the reason for the exclusion is clear from the first five paragraphs of the exclusion letter (see para. 26 above).  The second paragraph says that she relies on the two incidents on 6 May as a breach the &#8220;seriousness&#8221; of which satisfies the first part of the two-fold test: in other words, she is relying on &#8220;serious breach&#8221; under para. 16 of the Guidance.  (The IRP seems to treat it as inconsistent that two incidents are regarded as constituting &#8220;a serious breach&#8221;: if its point is that the letter should have said &#8220;two serious breaches&#8221; that is, with respect, pedantic in the extreme.)  She says in the fourth paragraph that on the basis of that conduct alone she judges that the second part of the test is justified because TZB&#8217;s continued presence would present an unacceptable risk to others.  It follows that it was not necessary to rely on his previous record.  <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">However</span>, she explains that she intends to refer to that record for two reasons.  First, the fact that he has not responded to previous sanctions reinforces the case on risk of further harm (fourth paragraph).  Second, if she were wrong that the incidents of 6 May were sufficiently serious by themselves, if they are taken with the breaches in his past record there is a &#8220;persistent&#8221; pattern of non-serious breaches which appears from his disciplinary record (fifth paragraph).  Both points are thus by way of reinforcement to her primary reason which is that both parts of the two-fold test are satisfied by reference to the incidents of 6 May alone.</p>

It is very common for a decision-maker to say &#8220;reason A is sufficient; but if necessary I rely also or alternatively on reason B&#8221;.  The IRP appeared to regard at least the second point as wrong because it believed that para. 16 of the Guidance means that a school has to rely either on serious breach or on persistent breach but &#8220;not both&#8221;.  That cannot be right.  In some cases a Headteacher will believe the pupil both has committed a serious breach (or breaches) and has a history of persistent (non-serious) breaches.  It would be artificial and misleading if they had to plump for one or the other as the justification for exclusion; and in a case where it is possible that the parent may argue that the breach(es) relied on did not meet the required level of seriousness, it is simple prudence, not illegitimate &#8220;bolstering&#8221;, to have a fallback position based on persistent breaches (if the facts justify it).  Ms Harrison submits that it is important that the Claimant knew what case she had to meet; but the letter does that by making it clear that the School is relying (if necessary) not only on the two incidents of 6 May but also on TZB&#8217;s past record. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In fact, when the GDC reached its decision not to reinstate it was prepared to proceed only on the basis that the two incidents on 6 May constituted a serious breach: see the first paragraph quoted from its letter of 8 June 2021 and para.10.5 of the minutes.  In other words, it upheld the exclusion simply by reference to the Headteacher&#8217;s primary case.  I can see nothing wrong in that or, like the Judge, anything that needed explaining.  In her skeleton argument Ms Harrison submits that the GDC &#8220;failed to test&#8221; the Headteacher&#8217;s reasoning.  Even if, contrary to what I believe, there were some lack of clarity about the that reasoning, the point would go nowhere for the reasons given at paras. 69-75 above.  </p>

I regard that as over-simple.  Even in a case based on a single serious breach it may be relevant to consider the pupil&#8217;s past record in order to assess the risk of harm in the future, or in order to see if there are any extenuating circumstances or other features which would render permanent exclusion disproportionate: as noted at para. 23 above, the two-fold test is not necessarily exhaustive.  </p>

The IRP was concerned that TZB may have been unofficially sent home in the interval between the incidents of 6 May and his exclusion a week later and observes that the GDC did not &#8220;test&#8221; this question.  I agree with the Judge that, even if this was a justified concern, it was not a matter which could in itself have affected the decision whether to reinstate TZB.  In her skeleton argument Ms Harrison asserts that &#8220;it was plainly relevant to the lawfulness of the Headteacher&#8217;s conduct vis-&#224;-vis TZB generally&#8221;; but that does not make it material to the exclusion decision.</p>

But that ignores the very point that the Judge was (correctly) making, namely that para. 17 of the Guidance, on which the IRP&#8217;s concern was expressly based, recommends only that the headteacher should give <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">the pupil</span> an opportunity to present their case.

The IRP rejected that argument (albeit, as it said, &#8220;just&#8221;) and thus accepted that the GDC had been entitled to make the finding that it did.  However, it went on to say:</p>

Additionally, it allowed the School and staff to plan for progression, monitor the effectiveness of teaching. monitor the provision for additional support needs within the School, collaborate with parents and other members of staff and help [TZB] become more involved in his own leaming and work towards specific targets. An Education Plan supported teaching and learning and set out actions for the teacher and student that are different from or additional to those that are in place for the rest of the class. It was reported that the Education Plan was no longer a legal requirement, &#8230; but as a school that believes in doing what is best for the students, having an education plan in place for each of our SEN students is a part of our best practice in school. The provision was monitored against the plan through termly SEND review meetings. [B] It was further reported that a Pastoral Support Plan was in place which was shared with all teaching staff. A Pastoral Support Plan was a school-based document which helps students to improve their social, emotional and behavioural skills. The PSP identified precise and specific targets for [TZB] to work towards. [C] &#8230; [TZB] attended the Behaviour for Leaming programme to improve his behaviour inside and outside the classroom, to therefore assist his learning and help build strong relationships with both peers and teachers. [D] [TZB] had challenges with self-confidence and had been placed on the Friends for Life. This was an intervention based on CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) designed to support students with maintaining positive relationships. The programme used CBT to address negative thought patterns about oneself to build self-esteem and teaches students healthy coping strategies, problem solving skills and assertiveness to better maintain positive relationships. </p>

Boys were taught a bespoke scheme of work to develop their self-awareness and resilience. Lessons focused on enabling students to better understand themselves as learners and individuals and work to build healthy and positive relationships with others. The aim of the programme was to cultivate resilience, motivation and optimism for the future and to empower to view themselves and their worlds in positive terms. [F] He had access to the School's counselling service and attended 12 sessions. Sessions were run by an external agency to support [TZB] in a talking-based therapy. The counsellor was a trained, objective professional with whom [TZB] could build a healing and trusting relationship. Students engaged in this process of talking about and working through your personal problems. [G] He received 11 placements in the Inclusion Centre and received support on the Social and Emotional Aspects of learning. The placement is set up to allow bespoke specialist small group support tailored to individual needs, taught by specialist SEN and mainstream teachers with daily tracker sheets sent home to include parental support. [H] He had also been assessed by the Clinical Psychologist and had sessions with her. [I] The School had opened an Early Help Assessment Plan (EHAP) and made eight referrals to Social Services.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Cross referred to this passage not so that we could ourselves assess the adequacy of the support given to TZB, which is not the issue before us, but simply so that we could assess the context for the reasoning that appears in the minutes of the subsequent reconsideration meeting.  The substantive exercise required by what the IRP had said was for the GDC to go back over that support and decide (in the IRP&#8217;s own phrase) &#8220;whether more could be done<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="9">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span> </span><marker name="tab"/><span>   </span><span style="font-size:11pt">I think this </span><span style="font-size:11pt">includes also</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> whether mo</span><span style="font-size:11pt">re</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> could have been done.</span></p>
	      </authorialNote>&#8221;.  Whether or not the particular steps referred to by the IRP had been taken was not of the essence: what mattered was whether there had been a failure of support of a kind which might have affected the decision whether to reinstate TZB.  Mr Cross pointed out that para. 19 of the Guidance does not in fact recommend, let alone require, a formal review after each fixed-term exclusion or a formal assessment of the pupil&#8217;s social, emotional and mental health a review was undertaken.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On balance I am persuaded by that submission.  I am bound to say that it would have been better if the GDC had said in terms that the particular kinds of support identified by the IRP would not have been significant in the context of the support that TZB was already receiving, but I do not feel able to say that the failure to do so amounted to an error of law.  The duty to give reasons, important as it is, should not impose an unrealistic burden on governors undertaking a reconsideration.</p>
