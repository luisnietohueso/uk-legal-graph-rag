	    <p><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Discrimination; compensation for financial loss; causation</span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The employment tribunal upheld the appellant&#8217;s complaints of (i) disability discrimination by failure to make reasonable adjustments; and (ii) victimisation. At a subsequent remedy hearing, it accepted evidence that, as a result of the respondent&#8217;s discriminatory conduct, the appellant developed a severe depressive episode which had made him permanently unfit for work. </span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The tribunal made an assessment of past and future wage loss and pension loss to the date of retirement but reduced that figure by 80% to reflect its assessment of the possibility that the appellant would, in any event, have sought an obtained ill health retirement on grounds unrelated to his severe depressive episode or, alternatively, that </span><span style="font-size:12pt">his employment with the respondent would have terminated by 31 March 2017, either by dismissal by the respondent on the basis of an irretrievable breakdown in working relationships or by a mutually agreed termination of employment on agreed terms. </span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-size:12pt">The appellant contended that the tribunal had erred in law in applying any reduction to what was, on the basis of the findings in fact, a career long loss. The respondent cross-appealed contending that the tribunal should have awarded loss only to the date on which it had concluded that the appellant would have been lawfully dismissed in any event. Alternatively, it should have apportioned loss on the basis of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt;color:#010302">BAE Systems (Operations) Limited v.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The appellant was correct to submit that the tribunal had erred in law in several material respects in reducing the award for past and future wage loss and pension loss. The principal appeal accordingly succeeded. The tribunal&#8217;s judgment on that issue was set aside and remitted to a differently constituted tribunal. </span></p>

It was based upon the same error of law made by the tribunal. On the findings of fact made by the tribunal, there was also no basis on which to apportion harm.  The cross-appeal was therefore refused.</span></p>

Certain other complaints did not succeed. The respondent&#8217;s liability for the reasonable adjustments complaint consisted of failures by the respondent to provide the appellant with items of office equipment which would have reduced the disadvantages experienced by him by reason of his condition of multiple sclerosis. The established acts of unlawful victimisation &#8211; which all occurred in 2015 &#8211; consisted of suspending the appellant, dismissing him, and thereafter refusing his appeal against dismissal. </span></p>

As will be noted below, they are, at times, muddled. Determining what the tribunal decided and why it did so has proved challenging, but ultimately not impossible. I will refer to paragraphs of the tribunal&#8217;s reasons as &#8220;ET &#167;&#8221; with the relative paragraph number. Within ET &#167; 49, the tribunal made 100 findings in fact which I will refer to, as the tribunal did in brackets as sub-paragraphs of ET &#167; 49.</span></p>

At times this was simply by verbatim incorporation of lengthy documents including parts of the appellant&#8217;s witness statement, and most of the material elements of three expert reports. The tribunal stated that whilst it found the appellant to be, on occasions, pedantic, it considered his witness statement to be truthful. The tribunal seems also to have found the experts to be credible and reliable.</span></p>

Dr Kinniburgh&#8217;s uncontradicted evidence was that that the initial onset of the illness was the result of the unlawful failure to make adjustments from 2013 onwards and that the illness was then made worse by the continuing failure to make adjustments and ultimately by the acts of victimisation in 2015. This anomaly in the tribunal&#8217;s reasons, whilst puzzling, may ultimately be of little relevance, as the failure to make adjustments and the victimisation were both unlawful acts of discrimination which, on the accepted evidence of Dr Kinniburgh, combined to cause the severe depressive condition which the appellant now has.  </span></p>

There is nothing in the tribunal&#8217;s reasons to suggest that it rejected Dr Kinniburgh&#8217;s evidence either on causation, or on the effect and likely duration of the appellant&#8217;s psychiatric illness.

There, it concluded that Dr Kinniburgh&#8217;s evidence on the issue of psychiatric incapacity was at odds with appellant&#8217;s evidence that, had the respondent not made him psychiatrically unwell, he would have intended to work until the age of 67 and would have done so. That conclusion is obviously illogical and plainly wrong. Apart from the tribunal&#8217;s conflation of two different questions, its reasoning also illustrates a failure to appreciate that Dr Kinniburgh&#8217;s evidence on incapacity related exclusively to the psychiatric issues that were caused by the respondent&#8217;s unlawful discrimination. His evidence did not amount to an opinion about the appellant&#8217;s health prognosis more generally. Once that is appreciated, the tribunal&#8217;s observation at ET &#167; 222 that it &#8220;preferred the expert psychiatric evidence&#8221; to that of the appellant makes no sense. It is perverse, and demonstrates that the tribunal did not understand the issues it should have been considering.</span></p>

The context of the quoted averment in the ET1 &#8211; which is found in the section of the appellant&#8217;s pleadings on loss &#8211; was a suggestion that even the possibility of enhanced (Tier 1) ill health retirement had ultimately been closed off by the discriminatory dismissal. The quoted section of the ET1 was not, on any rational view of it, an averment that the appellant would have become unfit for work and sought ill health retirement for reasons unrelated to the respondent&#8217;s discrimination.  </span></p>

It made no findings of fact about what degree of incapacity as a result of those conditions would have been required before the appellant would have become eligible for ill health retirement. More importantly, it did not hear from any skilled medical witness about the extent to which the non-psychiatric conditions might have affected the appellant had his employment continued after 2015. Dr Kinniburgh could not have expressed any opinion on that issue and, properly, he did not try to do so. The outer limit of his assistance to the tribunal on multiple sclerosis and diabetes was in considering a suggestion that either or both may have contributed to the appellant&#8217;s psychiatric ill health.

Andrews</span><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> [2007] ICR 825 &#8211; a case on compensation for unfair dismissal &#8211; was also authority for a staged approach to considering compensation for financial loss in a discrimination case. Specifically, it was submitted that if a tribunal is able to conclude, on a balance of probability, that a fair dismissal would have occurred anyway at a particular date, it should stop there and award loss only to that date. Only if it is not able to conclude that a fair dismissal would, on balance of probability, have occurred by such a date should the tribunal look at the question of reduction of the award based upon a percentage chance.   </span></p>

In the present case, however, it is not necessary to decide the point because this ground of the cross-appeal is based upon precisely the same error of law as was made by the tribunal. It asks the wrong question. As already noted, what the tribunal was considering, on its own findings, was discriminatory conduct which caused a career-long debilitating psychiatric condition. The date on which the appellant&#8217;s employment with the respondent would (or even might) have ended lawfully was not, of itself, relevant in the absence of further evidence as to the effect of such a lawful dismissal upon the appellant&#8217;s mental health. As noted above, the tribunal did not consider that question, and does not seem to have had any evidence about it. </span></p>

The tribunal, it is suggested, had other evidence of cause(s) of the appellant&#8217;s ill health which were not related to the respondent&#8217;s discriminatory acts. The tribunal&#8217;s focus on &#8220;cause&#8221; was unjustifiably narrow. It should have considered other material contributory factors. The tribunal did not &#8220;engage with relevant evidence&#8221; and thus &#8220;deprived the respondent of the opportunity to benefit from a conclusion that it was only partly responsible for the appellant&#8217;s psychiatric condition&#8221;.</span></p>

An example given in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt;color:#010302">BAE Systems</span><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> was the situation of exacerbation of a pre-existing condition not itself caused by a wrongful act of the respondent. In a case of psychiatric harm, the tribunal should consider whether the evidence allows a rational conclusion to be drawn that some part of the illness was caused by the employer&#8217;s wrongful conduct and some part by another factor or factors. The answer to this will always depend upon the evidence, and the tribunal may conclude that there is no basis on which to apportion harm. Before harm can be apportioned, however, the tribunal has to be satisfied that there was more than one factor which caused or materially contributed to the harm. In principle, it would have been an error of law for the tribunal not to have considered the question.</span></p>

Its acceptance of Dr Kinniburgh&#8217;s evidence that the respondent&#8217;s discriminatory acts cased the illness is a complete answer to this ground of the cross-appeal.
