That is so not only because such a course of action does not comply with the rules; it is also because the evident intent behind CPR 31 is that the disclosing party should apply their mind to the exercise.  The disclosing party is presumed to know the strengths and weaknesses of their own case and so is likely to be in a better position than their opponents, at least initially, to identify documents which will be relevant to the issues in the case, as seen through the eyes of the disclosing party, and in particular to identify documents capable of undermining their own case.  </span></p>

Furthermore, whilst Mr Jones&#8217; assertion may be accurate, in litigation of any complexity or value the disclosing party is likely to have instructed solicitors, and any competent solicitor would not countenance such conduct.  So, in this case, where the Phoenix Defendants have instructed highly competent solicitors, the involvement of those solicitors in the disclosure exercise would greatly increase the likelihood of disclosure of relevant material even if it is adverse to their clients&#8217; interests, because the alternative is that the solicitors would refuse to continue acting for the party.</span></p>

The risk of whether the Bank's documents might be relevant to such issues would clearly have to fall on the side of the Bank. In my judgment, the Court can properly except certain issues from a debarring order if it is satisfied, first, that such issues can fairly be tried without the Bank's disclosure; second, that such an exception would be in the interests of justice and fair to both parties; third that the conduct of the Bank is not so inexcusable that a full debarring order is deserved and is proportionate, and fourth that making exceptions from the debarring order in that way does not undermine the authority of the Court.

But the extent and ambit of any debarring order depends on the facts of the particular case and the nature and effect of the default.  Here it seems to me that the refusal to give proper disclosure must be met not just by a strike out order, but also by an order debarring the Phoenix Defendants from taking any substantive part in the proceedings.  In particular, it must debar them from advancing a positive case, cross-examining the Claimants&#8217; witnesses, or making submissions.  The reason why so comprehensive an order is appropriate is that it is impossible to see how it would be fair, or in the interests of justice, to permit the Defendants to take any such step when they have refused or failed to provide proper disclosure.  To do otherwise would mean that the court would be considering challenges to the Claimants&#8217; case without being able to ascertain whether the challenge was soundly based.</span></p>

They do not argue that this is a case which, on the evidence, ought to be determined summarily without a trial.  Instead, they argue that if, as I have indicated will happen, the defence is struck out, then there is no defence to the claim.  Referring to CPR 16.5, they argue that a defendant who fails to deal with an allegation is to be taken to admit that allegation, that as a result of the defence having been struck out, there is no defence dealing with the allegations made in the particulars of claim and so these Defendants must be taken to admit them.  In those circumstances, say the Claimants, the Phoenix Defendants now have no real prospect of resisting the claim and so summary judgment should now be entered.</span></p>

It assumes the Defendants can avoid their obligation to give proper disclosure by making available to the Claimants the unsorted material they hold. But, first, as is inherent in their argument, that only goes to the fairness of the proceedings and, as they correctly point out, the fairness of the trial is not an issue under CPR 24.2. Second, the defences of the Phoenix Defendants are going to be struck out for the reasons set out above. There will then, as the Claimants submit, be no pleaded defence from those three Defendants. The Phoenix Defendants will then be in the same position as a defendant who fails to deal with an allegations made in the Particulars of Claim; pursuant to CPR 16.5 (5), they will be taken to admit them. The qualifications to CPR 16.5(5) do not apply here; on this premise the Defendants have not set out the nature of their case; and this is not a money claim.</span></p>

They argue that if the Defendants were to plead a response, it is hard to see how they could have a reasonable prospect of defending the claim. They say that a permanent injunction will be necessary not only to ensure the Claimants have the benefit of the jurisdiction clause on which Butcher J&#8217;s decision rested, but also to protect the integrity of judgments entered in their favour by the English court.  They say that the damages claimed consist entirely of US attorneys&#8217; fees, which are a matter of record. There can be no substantive basis for saying that the fees were not incurred, and no reason to incur them other than to defend the claim which the Phoenix Defendants brought in breach of an exclusive jurisdiction clause.</span></p>
