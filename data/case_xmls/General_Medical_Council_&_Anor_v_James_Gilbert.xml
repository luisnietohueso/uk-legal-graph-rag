The conduct concerned five junior colleagues; and Mr. Gilbert had further abused his senior position in respect of two of them.

The lack of understanding that or why it was racist may, indeed, give rise to a separate concern. Antisemitism may sometimes be more difficult to spot than other forms of racism, in part because of the circumlocutions used to disguise it. But in my judgment, comment (d) fell into the obviously racist category. The word "Zionist" was a euphemism for "Jew": otherwise, it made no sense. The comment was an instance of two well-worn, racist conspiracy theories: that Jews control the government and that they use that control to commit acts of murder</span>.&#8221;</p>

The comments were indeed objectively racist. A remark can be objectively racist even though the person to whom it is uttered may not take offence, or may not perceive it to be motivated by hostility or prejudice. </p>

The Tribunal&#8217;s duty is to safeguard the public interest by correctly applying the law. The public would expect doctors to be sanctioned for uttering racist remarks, and public confidence in the medical profession may be harmed if they are not. If the test for racism were that a comment is only to be deemed racist if the recipient his/herself perceives the comment to be motivated by hostility or prejudice, despite the fact that any reasonable person would consider it objectively to be racist, that would seriously hinder this aspect of public confidence. The hearer of the racist remark may be junior to the clinician who makes the racist statement and be too intimidated to object. Does that mean that the remark is then deemed not to be racist? Obviously not.     </p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.49in">Indeed, in fairness to the Tribunal it is important to appreciate, in relation to sanction, that in its closing submissions before the Tribunal the GMC barely mentioned the allegations of racism and very largely focussed on the sexual misconduct charges. The only mentions of racism are those brief mentions in paragraphs 19(iv), 30, 32 (last sentence) and 62-64 of its written submissions and at D11/10B-D; D11/13C-D; and D11/18A-C of the transcript of its oral closing submissions. This is no doubt why the Tribunal dealt with the findings of racism more shortly than it dealt with its findings of sexual misconduct. This is also what led Ms Morris KC, counsel for the PSA to suggest that in the Tribunal&#8217;s Determination &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the racial dimension to the case disappeared from view</span>.&#8221; As I explain below, I consider that that submission goes too far, but it is true to say that the GMC&#8217;s firm focus, and accordingly the Tribunal&#8217;s too, was clearly upon the sexual misconduct allegations.  </p>

I agree with Ms Morris KC that referring to racism as &#8220;low level&#8221; is unhelpful, as it risks minimising the seriousness of racist conduct. But it is also unrealistic not to recognise that there is a spectrum of racist behaviour and that it is always necessary, in considering impairment and sanction, to have regard to the context in which the racist remark was made. A racist comment made in anger which offends the person to whom it is directed is likely to be more serious than a racist remark misguidedly made in jest to a person in circumstances where nobody hearing the remark takes offence. This is not to doubt for one moment, however, that both racist remarks are unacceptable and serious. I consider that this was the reasonable distinction which the Tribunal was seeking to make in referring to &#8220;low-level&#8221; racism albeit that the use of the epithet &#8220;low-level&#8221; was unfortunate. </p>

The third question: has the doctor in the past, or is he liable in the future, to breach one of the fundamental tenets of the medical profession?  Mr. Gilbert, in my submission, had a responsibility to recognise the imbalance of power which existed in the relationship that he had as a senior consultant and the junior colleagues, who were there trying to learn, who were there trying to be educated, to maintain clear boundaries in the relationship that he had with them. He failed in that regard over a significant period of time. Sexual misconduct, that these women have been a victim to, is very serious.

It also gave reasons for imposing an eight-month period of suspension as the appropriate sanction at paragraphs [523]-[530].

I also consider that there was an erroneous application of the relevant legal principles by the Tribunal in respect of Allegations 15(b) and 23(a).

A suspension of 12 months, which is the maximum period of suspension, reflects the seriousness of the misconduct of Mr. Gilbert and is also necessary for the maintenance of public confidence in the medical profession. It also gives Mr. Gilbert an adequate period to reflect upon and remediate his behaviour, before a review can take place to assess whether he is fit to practise once again or not. </p>
