Later BBGM EMFs are grouped by fund or strand. JotForm EMFs have been used since a funds relaunch in 2023/24, they are grouped by fund and so more easily filtered.</span></p>

Project teams also often submit EMFs days or weeks after the main application, which can cause them to fall into a different year. EMFs can be grouped by year, but there is no confident way to determine the data is accurate.</span></p>

There is no digital connection point between the application and its associated EMF. The process is done via a combination of matching up the name of the project, the organisation name (or name of lead contact/producer), the date the EMF was submitted and the fund that it was submitted under. A visual check is needed to ensure the correct form is being used. The content needs to be verified and standardised, as not every submission may use the same terminology. There are also differences between BBGM and JotForm exports which require manual checking to ensure the same data sits in the same excel columns. Each column of data reported against must be tallied and manually verified within an excel spreadsheet that collates the EMF submission answers together. A further table is created from this tallied data which also must be verified (to check formulas are working). The statement provides time estimates which give a total of 7 to 8 hours of work for around 200 projects.</span></p>

For the time period requested by the Appellant, it seems that EMFs were held in BBGM (as JotForm was not used until 2023/4). The earlier EMFs in BBGM did not specify the fund at all. Even where they did specify the fund, they might be duplicates or relate to a different year due to the way they were provided to and completed by the applicants. BFI&#8217;s submissions explain that applicants generally do not fill in the EMF until they have submitted the main application, often there are delays as up to six individuals may be attached to a project, and the process is repeated if team members change. The witness evidence explains further why there may be duplicate forms which are not removed from the system, and why EMFs may be provided in a different year from the application.</span></p>

It is also not possible to collate this data from the EMFs without matching them to the actual applications, which are held separately and not linked &#8211; not least because some of the EMFs held in BBGM do not even name the relevant project. The Appellant has argued that the information he has requested could be provided by looking at the content of each EMF, its name and where it is stored.

We also accept that the total of 7 to 8 hours for around 200 applications is a reasonable estimate, based on her explanations. There are a number of stages to the manual checks, but these are necessary to ensure that the data is accurate. This may seem unnecessarily time consuming to the Appellant, but public authorities are required to provide accurate information in response to a FOIA request, and this is what is needed to ensure accuracy.
