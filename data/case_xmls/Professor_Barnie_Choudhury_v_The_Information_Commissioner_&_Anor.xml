The client must be sure that what he tells his lawyer in confidence will never be revealed without his consent. Legal professional privilege is thus much more than an ordinary rule of evidence, limited in its application to the facts of the particular case. It is a fundamental condition on which the administration of justice as a whole rests.&#8221;</span></p>

A person seeking information from a government department does not have to demonstrate that &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221; exist which justify disclosure. Section 42 is not to be elevated &#8220;by the back door&#8221; to an absolute exemption. Ms Proops submits in her skeleton argument, it is for the public authority to demonstrate on the balance of probability, that the scales weigh in favour of the information being withheld. That is as true of a case in which Section 42 is being considered as it is in relation to a case which involves consideration of any other qualified exemption. Under FOIA, section 42 cases are different simply because the inbuilt public interest in non-disclosure itself carries significant weight which will always have to be considered in the balancing exercise once it is established that legal professional privilege attaches to the documents in question.&#8221;</span></p>

Although your employee may regard the disclosure of personal information about them as an intrusion into their privacy, often this may not be a persuasive factor on its own, particularly if the information is about their public role rather than their private life. You must be able to argue that adverse consequences would result from disclosure of the personal data. You must show that there is a connection between the disclosure of the requested information and the adverse consequences. For example, you have a strong argument for refusing a subsequent disclosure, if a previous disclosure of similar information has led to the targeting of individuals.2 You must therefore consider the nature of the information and judge the level of distress or damage likely to be caused.

In circumstances such as judicial recruitment when only certain candidates are qualified to apply, repeat candidates are likely.

Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes.</span></p>
