	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a jurisdictional dispute. The Claimants (&#8220;Tesla&#8221;) are respectively (i) a company incorporated in the State of Delaware, USA and headquartered in Texas which is the ultimate parent company of the multinational Tesla Group, and (ii) a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary incorporated in England and Wales which sells premium fully-electric vehicles, and provides services relating to such vehicles, in the UK. The First to Third Defendants (collectively &#8220;InterDigital&#8221;) are or were Delaware corporations whose principal place of business is in Delaware. The First Defendant has been dissolved and therefore can be ignored. The Second Defendant (&#8220;IDPH&#8221;) and the Third Defendant (&#8220;IDH&#8221;) are members of the InterDigital Group, which develops and licences wireless communications technology. The InterDigital Group owns a worldwide portfolio of patents which have been declared essential (&#8220;standard-essential patents&#8221; or &#8220;SEPs&#8221;) to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (&#8220;ETSI&#8221;) 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G standards (&#8220;the ETSI Standards&#8221;). These include European Patents (UK) Nos. 3 455 985, 3 566 413 and 3 718 369 (&#8220;the Challenged Patents&#8221;), the registered proprietor of which is IDPH and which were declared essential to the 5G standard by IDH. The Fourth Defendant (&#8220;Avanci&#8221;) is a company incorporated in Delaware whose principal place of business is in Texas which carries on business as an administrator of patent pools or (to use Avanci&#8217;s preferred term) platforms, including a platform for SEPs declared essential to the ETSI Standards for use in 5G-enabled vehicles (&#8220;the Avanci 5G Platform&#8221;). The InterDigital Group is among the licensor members of the Avanci 5G Platform. At the time of the hearing in the court below there were about 66 such members who owned around 170,000 SEPs. (Since then, those numbers have increased, but in this judgment I will for the most part continue to refer to the figures that were before the judge.)</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Tesla wish to launch 5G-enabled vehicles in the UK. The UK is the Tesla Group&#8217;s fourth largest market globally. The Avanci 5G Platform includes around 11,900 UK SEPs, all of which are the subject of undertakings given to ETSI which oblige their owners to offer licences of them on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (&#8220;FRAND&#8221;) terms to anyone who wishes to implement the ETSI Standards (or in some cases equivalent undertakings given to other standard-development organisations). Tesla accept that they will need a licence under these UK SEPs, and aver that a licence on FRAND terms will be a global licence in respect of all SEPs in the Avanci 5G Platform. Tesla complain that Avanci has only offered a flat rate of $32 per vehicle for such a licence on a non-negotiable basis. Tesla contend that this rate far exceeds a FRAND rate. Accordingly, Tesla have brought these proceedings with the objective of obtaining a determination by the Patents Court of what rate is FRAND. Tesla have undertaken to take a licence on the terms determined by the Patents Court to be FRAND (subject to adjustment as a result of any appeal). </p>

The Patent Claims are brought against IDPH. The Licensing Claims are brought against all the Defendants, with InterDigital being sought to be joined as representing all relevant licensor members of the Avanci 5G Platform pursuant to CPR rule 19.8.</p>

Tesla served the claim form so far as it relates to the Patent Claims on IDPH in England, pursuant to CPR rule 63.14(2). Permission to serve out was needed and granted for the Licensing Claims pursuant to a combination of gateways (3) (in relation to IDH and Avanci), (4A) (in relation to IDH) and (11) (in relation to all the Defendants) in CPR Practice Direction 6B paragraph 3.1, although Tesla subsequently abandoned reliance on gateway (4A). Tesla served the claim form on Avanci and InterDigital on 8 December 2023. </p>

On 8 March 2024 InterDigital and Avanci separately applied pursuant to CPR Part 11 to challenge the English courts&#8217; jurisdiction to hear the claims, or for an order that they should decline to exercise their jurisdiction. On 8 May 2024 InterDigital also applied to strike out the claim, without prejudice to their jurisdictional challenge. On 16 May 2024 Tesla applied for permission to amend their Particulars of Claim.</p>

He also struck out the Licensing Claims against IDPH, if validly served pursuant to rule 63.14(2), but otherwise dismissed the application to strike out. Tesla&#8217;s application to amend the Particulars of Claim was dismissed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judge granted Tesla permission to appeal against his jurisdictional orders on seven grounds and InterDigital permission to cross-appeal, if necessary, on two grounds. In addition, InterDigital have served a respondents&#8217; notice raising no less than 15 additional or alternative grounds for the judge&#8217;s decision in so far as it was in their favour (although one of these relates to costs and therefore does not require consideration at this stage). The appeals raise important issues as to the jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales to determine disputes as to what licence terms are FRAND at the behest of an implementer rather than a SEP owner in the context of a claim concerning a patent pool or platform.</p>

Clause 6.1 is a <span style="font-style:italic">stipulation pour autrui</span>. Expressing this in language more familiar to English lawyers, the result of a declaration to ETSI in accordance with clause 6.1 is a contract between the declarant (usually, but not necessarily, the SEP owner) and ETSI for the benefit of third parties, namely implementers who wish to practice the relevant standard and thus the SEP in question. The contract obliges the declarant and its Affiliates (as defined in the ETSI IPR Policy) to grant a licence of the SEP to any implementer who wants a licence on FRAND terms.</p>

To achieve this it is necessary, in the absence of agreement between the parties, for the national court to be able to enforce its determination against both parties. The national court can only enforce its determination against the SEP owner by withholding an injunction from the SEP owner if it is unwilling to abide by its ETSI Undertaking by granting a licence on the terms determined to be FRAND. The national court can only enforce its determination against the implementer by granting an injunction against the implementer if it is unwilling to take a licence on the terms determined to be FRAND.&#8221;</p>

Avanci consent to jurisdiction if the English courts exercise jurisdiction with respect to Tesla&#8217;s Licensing Claims against InterDigital, but not otherwise. It is therefore convenient to address the grounds of appeal by first considering Tesla&#8217;s claims against Avanci as if they stood alone before turning to Tesla&#8217;s claims against InterDigital.

I should make clear before proceeding further that nothing in this judgment touches on the possible use of this jurisdiction to make declarations as to issues of fact. Not all of the authorities relevant to that question were cited in argument, because it is common ground that the issues in relation to which Tesla seek declarations are legal ones, or at least mixed issues of fact and law, rather than purely factual ones.</p>

However, if it would, that it would then be appropriate to grant a declaration was agreed. The approach is pragmatic. It is not a matter of jurisdiction. It is a matter of discretion. The deployment of negative declarations should be scrutinised and their use rejected where it would serve no useful purpose. However, where a negative declaration would help to ensure that the aims of justice are achieved the courts should not be reluctant to grant such declarations. They can and do assist in achieving justice. &#8230; So in my judgment the development of the use of declaratory relief in relation to commercial disputes should not be constrained by artificial limits wrongly related to jurisdiction.

Following the coming into force of the&#160;Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006, Rolls-Royce took the view that it would be unlawful, under&#160;regulation 3&#160;of those Regulations, to use the length of service criterion, in that it discriminated on the grounds of age and was not a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. Rolls-Royce brought a claim under&#160;CPR Part 8&#160;to determine whether the inclusion of the criterion within a selection matrix for redundancy would be in breach of the Regulations. Unite initially objected to the adoption by Rolls-Royce of this procedure, but did not pursue this objection and opposed the claim on the merits. Sir Thomas Morison sitting as a judge of the High Court, while expressing the view that the question at issue was more appropriate for determination in employment tribunal proceedings rather than in proceedings under&#160;Part 8, held that the length of service criterion was not unlawful by virtue of&#160;regulation 3 and was in any event excepted by regulation 32. He granted Rolls-Royce permission to appeal, observing that he remained uneasy about the procedure which had been adopted. The Court of Appeal was doubtful as to whether it should hear the appeal, but was urged by both parties to do so and unanimously concluded that it should do so.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Aikens LJ went on to consider the application of these principles to the instant case at [121]-[128]. He expressed two concerns. The first was that collective agreements were not themselves legally enforceable, and therefore strictly speaking there was no dispute concerning legally enforceable rights between the parties before the court. On the other hand, he acknowledged that the terms of the collective agreements were incorporated into the employment contracts of Rolls-Royce&#8217;s employees, the lawfulness of the length of service criterion could arise between Rolls-Royce and any employee who was made redundant using that criterion and all, or nearly all, the employees were members of Unite. The second concern was that the individual employees were not before the court and it was accepted that they could challenge the lawfulness of the length of service criterion before an employment tribunal, and therefore it was doubtful that the current proceedings would serve a useful purpose when the issues might well be reconsidered all over again in the context where it really mattered, namely when disputes arose between Rolls-Royce and any employees who had been made redundant. This was particularly of concern because, although the majority of employees who had voted were content for Unite to adopt the stance it had, older employees were disadvantaged by the length of service criterion compared to younger employees. For these reasons, Aikens LJ would have held, if sitting at first instance, that the court should not exercise its jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief. Given that the High Court had not declined to exercise its jurisdiction, however, Aikens LJ&#8217;s conclusion was that the Court of Appeal should answer two very narrow questions of statutory construction concerning regulations 3 and 32, but otherwise decline to exercise the jurisdiction.</p>

A condition of the planning permission required the construction of a service road in order to provide access for the rear servicing of certain commercial properties on the site, including properties owned by Milebush, as part of pedestrianisation plans for the area. By clause 3.5 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/8/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> agreement (as varied) the developers covenanted to grant a right of way over the service road. Subsequently, Tameside acquired the development, including the&#160;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/8/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref>&#160;agreement, as an investment. It was common ground that, as successor in title to the developers, Tameside was obliged to grant the right of way provided for by clause 3.5. A dispute arose as to the extent of the right of way required by clause 3.5, with Milebush contending that it covered a pedestrian emergency exit from the rear of the properties, and Tameside contending that the right could not be used as a pedestrian emergency exit or for any purpose other than allowing access and egress to service the rear of the properties. Milebush brought a Part 8 claim against Tameside and Hillingdon seeking a declaration that Tameside was obliged by clause 3.5 to grant it the right of way it contended for. </p>

The second was that, in any event, it would not be a proper exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion to grant a declaration as to the construction of clause 3.5. Milebush claimed no private law right enforceable against either Tameside or Hillingdon. It sought declaratory relief against Tameside on the footing that it was directly affected by the interpretation placed upon the agreement. But it would be a pointless exercise for the court to grant Milebush a declaration in circumstances where, even if Milebush was right on the construction of clause 3.5 as it then stood, Hillingdon would retain the power as the planning authority to decide not to enforce, or to vary, clause 3.5.</p>

The most important consideration is likely to be whether the parties have a legitimate interest in obtaining the relief sought, whether to grant relief by way of declaration would serve any practical purpose and whether to do so would prejudice the interests of parties who are not before the court.&#8221;</p>

The International Telecommunication Union (&#8220;the ITU&#8221;), a UN agency based in Geneva, was responsible for the HEVC standard for high definition television technology, which was implemented by Vestel&#8217;s televisions. A large number of patents had been declared as essential to that standard. The Court of Appeal was not shown the relevant rules of the ITU, but was told that they required that patentees who declared SEPs had to commit to licensing them on FRAND terms. Philips, a Dutch company, had declared some SEPs. Access Advance, a company incorporated somewhere in the USA, administered a patent pool for the standard, the HEVC Advance pool. It operated as a representative for the holder of the relevant patents and offered a licence on that basis. Vestel accepted that they needed to obtain a licence from Access Advance in order to sell their televisions in the UK, and sought a declaration from the court that the terms of the licence offered by Access Advance were not FRAND. Philips was joined as representing all the patent holders in the HEVC Advance pool.</p>

By the time the case reached the Court of Appeal, however, Vestel had abandoned their claim for abuse of a dominant position. Instead, Vestel relied solely upon the general jurisdiction of the Patents Court to grant a declaration. Furthermore, as Birss LJ explained:</p>

When the claim began&#160;Vestel&#160;claimed such a legally enforceable right, on the basis that for either respondent to refuse to offer a licence on FRAND terms was a tort actionable by&#160;Vestel, ie an abuse of dominant position. That claim has been dropped and no attempt is made in the consequential amendments to introduce a new claim to a right to a FRAND licence. &#8230; The argument based on the inherent jurisdiction [to grant a declaration] is not founded on a claim to a legal right to a FRAND licence.</p>

The omission from either the terms of the declaration or the particulars of claim is not an accident of drafting.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The sole claim is for declaration or declarations of what the FRAND terms would be for a licence under the UK SEPs which are in the HEVC Advance pool. That claim can be brought under the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction because it would serve a useful purpose (<span style="font-style:italic">Rolls-Royce &#8230; v Unite </span>&#8230;). It serves a useful purpose because it establishes the licence which&#160;Vestel&#160;would need to avoid infringing those patents in the UK by carrying out its activity here, such as selling standard-compliant televisions. The subject matter of the claim is UK property&#8212;ie the UK patents. That is because it is a claim about what terms are available for a licence in respect of that property. Therefore the subject matter of the claim relates wholly or principally to property within the jurisdiction and so the case falls within gateway 11. The fact that the licences of the UK patents which would be FRAND would also license patents from other countries, cannot alter the fact that what&#160;Vestel&#160;is entitled to and is seeking is a licence under the UK patents.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">Submissions</span>. Counsel for Tesla submitted that the judge was wrong because the present case was distinguishable from <span style="font-style:italic">Vestel v Access</span>. In <span style="font-style:italic">Vestel v Access</span> Vestel had not pleaded any case that they had any right to a licence of any of the SEPs in the HEVC Advance pool on FRAND terms: no terms of any relevant ITU document requiring SEP owners to give undertakings had been  pleaded, still less any legal basis for an assertion that such undertakings gave rise to contracts between SEP owners and the ITU enforceable by implementers against SEP owners. (Vestel did not even plead the applicable law. We were told that there is no governing law clause in the ITU policy, and that the applicable law has been said to be Swiss law. This appears to be confirmed by <span style="font-style:italic">Alcatel Lucent SAS v Amazon Digital UK Ltd</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2025/43" uk:canonical="[2025] EWCA Civ 43" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2025">[2025] EWCA Civ 43</ref>.) By contrast, Tesla have pleaded that they are beneficiaries of the FRAND obligations owed by all the members of the Avanci 5G Platform pursuant to clause 6.1 of the ETSI IPR Policy, which <span style="font-style:italic">Unwired Planet</span> establishes can be enforced at least to the extent explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Optis v Apple</span>. He argued that the judge had correctly drawn this distinction in the context of the second issue identified by the judge:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.02in">The first aspect is whether there is a legal right in issue that justifies the claim for declaratory relief, to which the obvious answer is: yes, so far as IDH is concerned. Even though Tesla does not seek specifically to enforce IDH&#8217;s contractual obligation in French law, the ETSI undertaking is the legal standard by which Tesla&#8217;s claim about the terms of a FRAND licence is to be measured. &#8230;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel for Avanci submitted that the judge was right. A declaration could only be made in respect of a legal right. Furthermore, the legal right must be one between the parties to the proceedings. Tesla had pleaded a legal right enforceable against InterDigital and other SEP owners, but Tesla had not pleaded any legal right against Avanci. It was not sufficient that the declarations would serve a useful purpose even if that was the case.</p>

In my judgment the present case is to be distinguished from <span style="font-style:italic">Vestel v Access </span>for the reasons given by counsel for Tesla. It follows that the judge was in error in concluding that it was indistinguishable. That conclusion is not the end of the matter, however, because it does not dispose of counsel for Avanci&#8217;s argument, which goes further than <span style="font-style:italic">Vestel v Access</span>. On this argument, it would have made no difference if Vestel had pleaded that they had a legal right to a licence on FRAND terms enforceable against the SEP owners such as Philips because that would still not have been a right against Access Advance.</p>

(As the judge observed, declaration (4) is unlikely to be disputed.) Furthermore, it is well established that, in a developing area of law such as this, the facts should be established before deciding whether a claim is legally viable: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Lungowe v Vedanta </span>at [48].</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel for Avanci correctly distinguished in his submissions between the questions of (1) whether a legal right is required and (2) who must have, or be subject to, that legal right. As I think he acknowledged, it is the second question that matters in the present case. Even if a legal right is required, Tesla have pleaded that they have legal rights against all the SEP owners who are members of the Avanci 5G Platform, namely the FRAND obligations owed by those members. What Tesla have not done is plead any legal right against Avanci. Thus the crucial issue is whether, as Avanci contends, it is a requirement for the grant of declaratory relief concerning a legal right that the defendant is either the owner of, or subject to, the legal right relied upon. Tesla dispute this.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In support of the proposition that this is a requirement, counsel for Avanci relied upon the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive v National Union of Rail and Transport Workers </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2024/37" uk:canonical="[2024] UKSC 37" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2024">[2024] UKSC 37</ref> (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Nexus</span>&#8221;). In that case the claimant (&#8220;Nexus&#8221;) brought a claim against two trade unions for rectification of a collective bargaining agreement between Nexus and the unions. As in <span style="font-style:italic">Rolls-Royce v Unite</span>, the collective agreements were not legally enforceable, but were incorporated into the employment contracts of Nexus&#8217; employees. No employee was joined as a defendant to the claim. The Supreme Court held that the collective agreement was capable of being rectified even though it was legally unenforceable, and that rectification of the collective agreement would automatically affect the legal rights of the parties to the employment contracts, but that Nexus had brought the claim against the wrong defendants. There was no dispute between Nexus and the unions as to the existence or extent of any legal right between Nexus and the unions. Nexus was asking the court to make an order which would alter the rights of the employees without giving any of them the right to be heard even by means of the representative procedure under CPR rule 19.8. The Court went on forcefully to disapprove the procedure adopted in <span style="font-style:italic">Rolls-Royce v Unite</span>, stating that the concerns expressed by the Court of Appeal, in particular by Aikens LJ, were amply justified. In this context Lord Leggatt and Lady Simler, with whom Lords Lloyd-Jones, Sales and Burrows agreed, cited the following statement of Viscount Maugham in&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">London Passenger Transport Board v Moscrop</span>&#160;<ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1942] AC 332" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1942">[1942] AC 332</ref> at 345:</p>

Accordingly, there is no discussion in the judgment of the general jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief, still less of the relevant authorities, none of which appear to have been cited apart from <span style="font-style:italic">Rolls-Royce v Unite</span>. As I have explained, the Supreme Court disapproved of the procedure adopted in <span style="font-style:italic">Rolls-Royce v Unite</span>, but the procedural objection must be distinguished from the jurisdictional question. I do not understand the Supreme Court to have held that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to make the declarations sought by Rolls-Royce.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as the first question is concerned, it is necessary to be clear as to the effect of the rival contentions. Avanci&#8217;s argument amounts to saying that the royalty rate of $32 per vehicle which it charges for licences under the Avanci 5G Platform does not have to be FRAND, because (i) Avanci does not itself owe any FRAND obligation and (ii) the FRAND obligations owed by the members are irrelevant because those obligations can only be enforced bilaterally against each SEP owner. It is implicit in this argument that the royalty rate can only be challenged, if at all, through the mechanism of competition law. In saying this, I should make it clear that Avanci contends that it can justify $32 as being FRAND if it has to.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Tesla&#8217;s argument amounts to saying that the royalty rate charged by Avanci does have to be FRAND. Tesla accept that Avanci does not itself owe any FRAND obligation, but contend that that is not determinative. Tesla allege that, as a matter of commercial reality, the only licence of UK SEPs covered by the Avanci 5G Platform which can be FRAND is a global platform licence of the kind offered by Avanci as agent for the SEP owners because negotiating bilateral licences with more than 65 SEP owners is impracticable. Tesla also allege that, in reality even if not formally, most members of the Avanci 5G Platform rely upon the availability of a licence under that platform as fulfilling their FRAND obligations. Although these allegations are disputed by Avanci (and InterDigital), I consider that Tesla have a real prospect of establishing them. Indeed, the former allegation receives some support from a striking submission made by counsel for Avanci himself, who has considerable experience in this field, that there was a stark difference between what Avanci had achieved with its Platforms in the automotive sector and what he termed &#8220;the licensing debacle&#8221; in the mobile phone sector. &#8220;Debacle&#8221; is, in my view, something of an overstatement; but nevertheless it is an inescapable fact that, in the absence of any pool or platform licence in that sector, there has been, and continues to be, worldwide litigation between multiple players. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In appraising the parties&#8217; arguments, it is relevant to enquire what the effect would be of a declaration by the Patents Court that $32 per vehicle was not FRAND, but that a specified lower amount was. When doing so, it is important to appreciate that declarations can serve a useful purpose even though they are neither enforceable in themselves nor have any enforceable consequences. This point is illustrated by <span style="font-style:italic">Panasonic v Xiaomi</span>. Xiaomi sought a declaration that a willing licensor in the position of Panasonic would agree to grant Xiaomi an interim licence on FRAND terms pending the determination by the Patents Court of what terms were FRAND for a final licence. One of Panasonic&#8217;s objections to this was that such a declaration would serve no useful purpose because it could, and would, simply ignore the declaration. This Court nevertheless concluded that the grant of the declaration would serve a useful purpose because there was a reasonable prospect that it would induce Panasonic to reconsider its position. Shortly after the Court gave its decision, Panasonic did agree to grant Xiaomi an interim licence. There can be little doubt that a key reason for this change of position was this Court&#8217;s determination as to the appropriate terms for an interim licence, which &#8220;split the difference&#8221; between the parties. Thus the declaration did serve a useful purpose despite not having any enforceable consequences.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Similarly, in the present case, it is well arguable that a determination by the Patents Court that a licence of UK SEPs covered by the Avanci 5G Platform on FRAND terms is a global licence under that Platform, but at a lower rate than $32 per vehicle, would force Avanci to reconsider its position. This is for two reasons. First, it would make Avanci&#8217;s position that its rate is in fact FRAND, even though it is not required to be FRAND, unsustainable. Secondly, it would be clear that the members of the Avanci 5G Platform could not rely upon the availability of a $32 licence under the Avanci 5G Platform as discharging their FRAND obligations. It follows that there is a real prospect that Avanci would conclude that it should revise the rate it charges under the SPLA. As InterDigital accept, members would then be faced with a choice of approving the revised rate proposed by Avanci or leaving the Avanci 5G Platform. In InterDigital&#8217;s words, &#8220;it would be untenable for the Platform to offer terms determined as non-FRAND against Avanci&#8221;. Accordingly, there is a real prospect that the declarations would serve a useful and legitimate purpose.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This takes me to the second question posed in paragraph 93 above. If the claim against Avanci proceeds, but the claim against InterDigital does not, and no SEP owners apply to be joined as defendants, it will be open to Avanci to argue that the Patents Court should not exercise its discretion to make declarations in favour of Tesla because of the effect on the interests of the members of the Avanci 5G Platform when they were not represented. In my judgment, it is not inevitable that the Patents Court would decline to exercise its discretion in favour of Tesla for the following reasons. </p>

	    <num>99.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, it is common ground between Avanci and InterDigital that the $32 rate was devised by Avanci in the exercise of its own judgment based on its own investigations. Although Avanci arrived at this rate after discussions with potential licensors and potential licensees as explained in paragraph 17 above, no SEP owner had any say in the choice of the rate. Indeed, InterDigital go so far as to say that they do not know how the $32 figure was arrived at. The same must be true of the other members of the Avanci 5G Platform. Thus the proper defendant to Tesla&#8217;s claim that $32 is not FRAND is Avanci, and the SEP owners appear to have little to contribute to the debate even though, if Tesla are right, the SEP owners rely upon $32 being FRAND.</p>

	    <num>100.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, if any SEP owners consider that they do have something to contribute to the debate, or simply wish to ensure that they are heard before any decision affecting their interests is taken, it will be open to them to apply to be joined as defendants (or perhaps to intervene in some other way). At this stage it is not known what view they all take. InterDigital want no part in these proceedings, but other members might take a different view. For example, a group of members might decide that one of them should represent their collective interests.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, a declaration in favour of Tesla would not necessarily adversely affect the interests of the SEP owners. Suppose, for example, that the Patents Court determined that the FRAND rate was $31 rather than $32. Avanci might decide to respect the decision and absorb the loss itself rather than try to pass it on to the members. As explained in paragraph 19 above, Avanci is independent of the members. This is its business, by which it aims to generate a profit. There is no evidence that Avanci could not, or would not, take the hit; and even if there was, intentions can change, as <span style="font-style:italic">Panasonic v Xiaomi</span> illustrates.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with Birss LJ&#8217;s reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Vestel v Access</span>, and in my judgment it applies to Tesla&#8217;s Licensing Claims against both Avanci and InterDigital. First, the Licensing Claims are legal claims to declarations because they are founded upon the FRAND obligations of the members of the Avanci 5G Platform. Contrary to Avanci&#8217;s and InterDigital&#8217;s submissions, I do not think Birss LJ meant that the obligation in question must be enforceable directly against the relevant defendant; but if he did, I respectfully disagree. In any event, this point would not assist InterDigital, since Tesla can certainly enforce InterDigital&#8217;s FRAND obligations against InterDigital albeit that Tesla have no claim for specific performance. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, the Licensing Claims relate wholly to property within the jurisdiction because the claims concern UK SEPs. InterDigital argue that the jurisdiction question cannot be determined by what InterDigital characterise as the artificial framing of the declarations sought by Tesla, when in reality the claim on Tesla&#8217;s own case is a contractual claim to a global licence of SEPs, the vast majority of which are non-UK SEPs. While I appreciate the superficial attraction of this argument, I do not accept it for reasons which should be familiar to students of the English courts&#8217; jurisprudence in this field. In short, it is necessary to distinguish between the property on the one hand and the FRAND obligation which affects it on the other hand. Patents are territorial rights, but (i) standards such as the ETSI Standards are global standards which are exploited globally, (ii) the FRAND obligation under clause 6.1 is a global one and (iii) a licence on FRAND terms may well be a global one (meaning that a UK-only licence is not FRAND). Thus a licence to a single UK SEP on FRAND terms can be, and often is, a global licence to all corresponding SEPs (and indeed other families of SEPs in the same portfolio). In <span style="font-style:italic">Nokia v OPPO</span> this Court upheld the jurisdiction of the English courts in respect of the claim even though the UK represented less than 0.5% of the relevant market (which does not necessarily mean that only 0.5% of the SEPs were UK ones, but nevertheless gives a sense of the order of magnitude). That case concerned an infringement claim, and so the jurisdictional analysis was somewhat different, but nevertheless it illustrates the point. Thus the Licensing Claims relate wholly to UK SEPs even though it is Tesla&#8217;s case that the FRAND obligations attaching to those UK SEPs carry with them an obligation to grant a licence of global, and not merely UK, extent. Indeed, neither Avanci nor InterDigital dispute that a licence on FRAND terms of the relevant SEPs would be a global one.</p>

Furthermore, even against InterDigital, I consider that the Patent Claims and the Licensing Claims are distinct claims which should be separately characterised for forum purposes. Even though the Patent Claims include a claim for a declaration of non-essentiality, which is tantamount to a declaration of non-infringement, if those claims stood on their own, they would not raise any issue as to FRAND. It would be different if there was a claim in respect of a threat of infringement proceedings by InterDigital, or if there was a threat by InterDigital to counterclaim for infringement, because then Tesla could invoke InterDigital&#8217;s FRAND obligations as a defence to the infringement claim. Conversely, it is common ground that a determination of the Licensing Claims would obviate the need to determine the Patent Claims. Thus the Patent Claims and the Licensing Claims could be determined in different fora without any risk of conflicting judgments.</p>

More specifically, the dispute is as to what royalty rate is FRAND. There is no dispute that a dollar-per-vehicle rate is appropriate, but the question is how many dollars per vehicle.</p>

Viewed in that manner, the factors connecting the dispute with Argentina were strong: the acts complained of took place there; the witnesses were there and mainly spoke Spanish, not English; the documents were there and in Spanish; the court there would be familiar with local conditions; the court there would not require expert evidence whereas the English court would; and the court there would be much better placed to assess the significance of related proceedings which had already taken place there.

The CAFC explained that it was common ground that the Constitution could authorise district courts to hear infringement claims based on foreign patents, but &#8220;the critical disputed issue is whether there is any statutory basis for such subject matter jurisdiction&#8221;.

This argument depended on (i) whether &#167;1367(a) authorised such supplemental jurisdiction, and (ii) whether the district court&#8217;s exercise of such supplemental jurisdiction was within its &#167;1367(c) discretion.</p>

It therefore does not matter that only 7% of the SEPs are UK patents, any more that it mattered in <span style="font-style:italic">Nokia v OPPO</span> that the UK was only 0.5% of the market.</p>

The dispute is not about the MLMA, it is about FRAND obligations under clause 6.1 of the ETSI IPR Policy, which is governed by French law. Thus the proper law is in principle a neutral factor as between England and the US: in both fora, any dispute as to the extent of the FRAND obligations will require expert evidence. If anything, this factor slightly favours England as a forum, since the Patents Court has already given detailed consideration to the relevant French law in several cases: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Nokia Technologies OY v OnePlus Technology (Shenzhen) Co Ltd&#160;</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/pat/2023/1912" uk:canonical="[2023] EWHC 1912 (Pat)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWHC 1912 (Pat)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2024] RPC 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2024">[2024] RPC 1</ref>&#160;at [168]-[201] (Meade J), <span style="font-style:italic">Panasonic v Xiaomi</span> at [46]-[49] and <span style="font-style:italic">Lenovo v Ericsson</span> at [79]-[90].

As InterDigital submitted &#8230; it is in no position to assess the value of other Patentees&#8217; portfolios, or provide the relevant comparable licences (or even the Avanci Licences that have been granted to licensees), and confidentiality and anti-trust issues in the US might well prevent it from obtaining the necessary documents.</p>

The Court and any expert valuers would need access to relevant licences granted by all Patentees and documents relating to their portfolios in order to perform the valuation exercise.

First, InterDigital contend (ground 5) that the judge was wrong to hold that the declarations sought by Tesla against InterDigital involve any relevant legal right since (i) InterDigital cannot grant a licence under the Avanci 5G Platform, (ii) InterDigital cannot compel Avanci to grant a licence and (iii) InterDigital cannot licence other members&#8217; SEPs.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I disagree. As the judge recognised, Tesla rely upon legal rights, namely InterDigital&#8217;s FRAND obligations in respect of their SEPs, and in particular their UK SEPs. Tesla are beneficiaries of those FRAND obligations. Tesla do not seek specific performance of those obligations, but nor do Tesla need to. As discussed above, an implementer who accepts the need for a licence and undertakes to take one on terms determined by the Patents Court to be FRAND can bring declaratory proceedings to determine what terms are FRAND. Thus the FRAND obligation provides an applicable legal standard and makes the issue properly justiciable. The points relied on by InterDigital go to whether a useful and legitimate purpose would be served by the declarations, not whether a legal right is engaged.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, InterDigital contend (ground 4) that the judge should have held that the declarations would not serve any useful and legitimate purpose. In my judgment the judge was correct to hold that Tesla have a real prospect of success on this question. None of the three points relied upon by InterDigital is determinative at this stage. Even though InterDigital cannot grant a licence under the Avanci 5G Platform, nor compel Avanci to do so, nor licence other members&#8217; SEPs, it is arguable that a declaration that a licence of InterDigital&#8217;s UK SEPs on FRAND terms would be a licence under the Avanci 5G Platform but at a rate of (say) $24 per vehicle would serve a useful and legitimate purpose because that would mean that InterDigital could not rely upon the availability of the current SPLA as discharging their FRAND obligations. In practice, this might well cause Avanci to reconsider its position, which might well lead to Avanci proposing and members accepting a revision to the SPLA. But even if Avanci stood firm, such a declaration would affect InterDigital&#8217;s ability to enforce their UK SEPs against Tesla. In any event, as I shall explain, Tesla&#8217;s claims against InterDigital embrace the possibility of a determination of FRAND terms for a bilateral licence.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, InterDigital contend (ground 5bis) that the judge should have held that there was no proper claim against InterDigital even if the claims against Avanci proceed. It is said by InterDigital that there would be &#8220;no incremental benefit&#8221; to declarations against InterDigital in those circumstances, and therefore the declarations would serve no useful and legitimate purpose. In my judgment it is arguable that the declarations sought against InterDigital would serve a useful and legitimate purpose even (i) if declarations were made against Avanci and (ii) InterDigital had not been ordered to represent the other members of the Avanci 5G Platform. </p>

This argument depends on the fact that InterDigital have arranged their affairs so that IDPH owns the SEPs although IDH gave the undertakings to ETSI. InterDigital accept that the FRAND obligations arising from IDH&#8217;s undertakings extend to IDPH as IDH&#8217;s Affiliate (see paragraph 9 above), but rely upon the fact that IDPH is not a member of Avanci, only IDH. I do not accept this argument. It is entirely proper for Tesla to bring their claim against IDPH as well as IDH in order to ensure that IDPH, which would be the primary claimant in any infringement claim, is bound by any declaration that Tesla obtain.  </p>

InterDigital do not dispute that they owe Tesla FRAND obligations. Nor do they dispute that a FRAND licence of their UK SEPs would be a global one. InterDigital do dispute that a FRAND licence of their UK SEPs would be a licence on the terms of the Avanci 5G Platform.

Furthermore, it would be pointless to make Tesla start again with this claim if I am right that Tesla can establish jurisdiction against InterDigital for the reasons given in paragraphs 206-217 below (compare the judge&#8217;s reasoning with respect to full and frank disclosure discussed in paragraphs 218-219 below). Whether Tesla really want a bilateral licence is not the relevant question, but whether a declaration as to FRAND terms for a bilateral licence would serve a useful purpose. In my judgment such a declaration would at least arguably be useful to Tesla even though it would be contrary to their primary case that a FRAND licence of InterDigital&#8217;s SEPs is a licence under the Avanci 5G Platform.

But even if it is supposed that InterDigital would find it impossible themselves to justify $32, the entity whose assistance they would require would be Avanci.

At this stage it is far from certain that, in those circumstances, either side would wish to rely upon evidence of comparable licences entered into by other members of the Avanci 5G Platform. Even if they did, there is no reason to suppose that it would be necessary or proportionate to adduce evidence of licences entered into by all members of the Platform who have entered into relevant licences. At most a representative selection should suffice. I acknowledge that there might well be a significant dispute about which licences were representative. Even so, the problems of identifying and obtaining representative comparable licences entered into by other members of the Avanci 5G Platform would confront both sides equally. InterDigital would not be disadvantaged in comparison with Tesla.

That plainly is not possible where there is a conflict of interest between class members (in that an argument which would advance the cause of some would prejudice the position of others) but is possible where there is a divergence of interests (in that an issue arises, or may well arise, in relation to the claims of, or against, some class members but not others) (post, paras 71&#8211;74).</p>

The judge&#8217;s answer to this question was no, at least in most cases, because it would put the represented person in a position of having to choose between having their interests represented by someone else and submitting to the jurisdiction in order to defend their interests themselves ([115]-[119]).</p>

Accordingly, Tesla have applied for permission to adduce fresh evidence on the appeal directed to this question, consisting of the fifth witness statement of Dr Bethan Hopewell of Powell Gilbert, Tesla&#8217;s solicitors. This reports the results of an analysis of a database of declarations to ETSI maintained by a company called IPlytics. The analysis indicates that, as at the date of the witness statement (6 August 2024), 57 of the then 67 members of the Avanci 5G Platform owned UK SEPs. Tesla acknowledge that this information was readily available at the time of the hearing before the judge, but nevertheless contend that the <span style="font-style:italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1954] 1 WLR 1489" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1954">[1954] 1 WLR 1489</ref> criteria are satisfied. In the case of the first criterion, Tesla say that they had no cause to adduce this evidence because neither InterDigital nor Avanci took a relevant point against Tesla, and the question was first raised by the judge in an email to the parties while writing his judgment.</p>

In the alternative InterDigital contended that, if Dr Hopewell&#8217;s statement was admitted, InterDigital should have permission to adduce responsive evidence contained in a sixth witness statement of Alexandra Brodie of Gowling WLG, InterDigital&#8217;s solicitors. This evidence suggests that there are certain errors in the analysis reported by Dr Hopewell, and indicates that, as at the date of Ms Brodie&#8217;s statement (20 September 2024), 53 of the then 67 members of the Avanci 5G Platform owned UK SEPs.

Given that the objection is not pressed, I consider that it is appropriate to grant Tesla permission to adduce Dr Hopewell&#8217;s evidence on terms that Ms Brodie&#8217;s evidence is also admitted in order that this Court may proceed upon a proper understanding of the factual position.</p>

Even if there is no hard-edged rule preventing a representation order being made in respect of such persons, it is certainly relevant to the exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion that the effect of the order sought by Tesla would be to expose these 14 members to proceedings before the English courts whose outcome will bind them when jurisdiction could not be established against them if sued in their own capacities. This can clearly be seen from the judge&#8217;s proposal for an opt-out in the event of a conflict of interest, which would lead to such members becoming self-represented.</p>

This argument was not developed by counsel for Tesla. In the absence of further explanation, I do not accept this argument.

As InterDigital point out, however, this means that a declaration against InterDigital would not bind those members of the Platform that do not own UK SEPs. Although Tesla argue that such a declaration would still serve a useful purpose, this must detract from the appropriateness of a representation order because it involves an acceptance that not of all the affected class can be represented by InterDigital.</p>

As I commented there, the members of the Platform appear to have little to contribute to that debate. As I discussed in paragraph 100 above, some members might nevertheless take the view that they wished to be heard, and might choose to be represented by one of their number. But it is difficult to see why Tesla should be able to dictate the choice of InterDigital as their representative regardless of the wishes of either InterDigital or the other members.</p>

Even if InterDigital would be a defendant anyway, they would be likely to incur additional costs as a result of being ordered to represent the other members. It is difficult to see why InterDigital should be involuntarily burdened with this. All that Tesla could point to by way of justification was that InterDigital are among the top 10 SEP owners in the Avanci 5G Platform and have experience of litigating FRAND issues in this jurisdiction. There are other members of whom this is also true, however. But in any event, the problem is caused by forcing any one member to represent the interests of the other members in the absence of a consensual arrangement. </p>

InterDigital argue that it does matter because (i) L1 cannot be forced to represent itself and (ii) the fact that L1 has a threshold share means that it could block a variation under the MLMA.

It follows that it is unnecessary to consider the additional or alternative grounds for upholding his decision advanced by InterDigital (grounds 7-10) to the extent that they extend beyond matters I have already covered, in particular InterDigital&#8217;s argument (ground 9) that the judge was wrong to accept that the members of the Avanci 5G Platform all have the same interest.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As explained above, Tesla served the claim form on IDPH within the jurisdiction in reliance upon rule 63.14(2). It is common ground that that was valid service in relation to the Patent Claims. Tesla contend that this was also valid service in relation to the Licensing Claims, and the judge accepted this. InterDigital contend that he was wrong on this point. There is no dispute that rule 63.14(2) is to be interpreted as meaning &#8220;a claim form <span style="font-style:italic">in so far as</span> relating to a registered right may be served&#8221;. The issue is whether the Licensing Claims &#8220;relate to&#8221; the Challenged Patents. This is not an issue about corporate identity: as noted in paragraph 167 above, InterDigital accept that the FRAND obligations arising from IDH&#8217;s declarations to ETSI extend to IDPH as IDH&#8217;s Affiliate. Furthermore, although InterDigital point out that Tesla only purported to serve the claim form on IPDH with respect to the Challenged Patents, the issue would be the same with respect to all of InterDigital&#8217;s other UK SEPs.</p>

Once the implementer has such a licence, they cannot infringe the SEP(s). This is why the FRAND obligation is commonly raised by way of defence to infringement proceedings brought by SEP owners against implementers. Tesla have undertaken to take a licence to (<span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>) InterDigital&#8217;s UK SEPs on the terms determined by the Patents Court to be FRAND, and they seek a determination as to what terms are FRAND. This is in order to ensure that they cannot be sued for infringement of those SEPs (among others). In my view it is impossible to say that that claim does not &#8220;relate to&#8221; InterDigital&#8217;s UK SEPs.</p>

This is because, once granted, European Patents are distinct national patents even though they are the result of a single application to the European Patent Office. Thus they are commonly referred to as &#8220;bundle patents&#8221;. A European Patent (UK) is, by virtue of provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1977/37" uk:canonical="1977 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Patents Act 1977</ref> which it is unnecessary to set out, a patent under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1977/37" uk:canonical="1977 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1977 Act</ref>, but European Patents (DE), (FR), (IT) and (SP) are not.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">InterDigital argue that this reasoning applies to the Licensing Claims. I disagree. Once again, the point depends upon the proper characterisation of the Licensing Claims. The Licensing Claims seek to enforce the FRAND obligations attaching to InterDigital&#8217;s UK SEPs, and thus &#8220;relate to&#8221; patents under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1977/37" uk:canonical="1977 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1977 Act</ref> as explained above. It makes no difference that Tesla contend that a FRAND licence of InterDigital&#8217;s UK SEPs is a licence which extends to InterDigital&#8217;s non UK-SEPs, and indeed non-UK SEPs of other members of the Avanci 5G Platform.</p>

It follows that, contrary to InterDigital&#8217;s contention, the judge was correct to hold at [143] that, if the claim was validly served on IDPH within the jurisdiction pursuant to rule 63.14(2), the Licensing Claims should not be stayed on the grounds of <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span> because InterDigital have not established that the Delaware Court of Chancery is clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum than the Patents Court. Although that conclusion would not apply to IDH, because IDH was not served within the jurisdiction, the close relationship between the claims against IDPH and those against IDH would lead to the conclusion that Tesla had shown that the Patents Court was clearly or distinctly the appropriate forum for the determination of the claims against IDH applying the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Lungowe v Vedanta</span> at [68].  </p>

Indeed, one of the owners (identified in these proceedings as L1) has agreed such a licence with Tesla. There is no suggestion, however, that any of the other owners have refused to negotiate bilaterally with Tesla, let alone that they have refused to grant a licence of their own portfolio of SEPs on FRAND terms.   </p>

The undertaking clearly and distinctly creates an obligation on individual owners to license the Patent Family of their declared SEPs, but it cannot be interpreted as extending to include licensing a portfolio which includes many SEPs owned by other organisations altogether. Tesla has not advanced a case to the contrary, as pointed out by Avanci in oral submissions on this appeal:</p>

I cannot see how it does. The fact that the owners have given undertakings to ETSI, derogating from their rights under the general law to that extent, in no way limits their freedom to exploit their rights in any legitimate way, whether on their own or jointly with others. Placing their SEPs on the Avanci 5G Platform is a convenient and highly beneficial way for a vast number of SEPs to be offered collectively to the car industry, avoiding the &#8220;licensing debacle&#8221; which has arisen in other sectors when multiple implementers have sought licences from multiple owners. Such an arrangement is in addition to (and may well, for an implementer, be preferable to relying on) the ETSI undertaking given by each owner. In my judgment the owners who have joined the Platform have not somehow extended the scope of their undertaking to ETSI or entered any other binding agreement to license their SEPs on a collective basis.     </p>

If, in financial terms, the licence would &#8220;simply&#8221; be the sum of the rates which would be FRAND for each owner&#8217;s portfolio of SEPs, the concept would add nothing: each owner would be entitled (and obliged) to be involved in the negotiation and determination of that rate pursuant to its undertaking to ETSI. But Tesla would certainly be disappointed by that exercise and its result, and that is plainly not what it intends: Tesla is plainly contending that the FRAND rate for a licence of all the SEPs on the Platform would be a single collective rate, heavily discounted for bulk and convenience. But the owners of the SEPs have simply not agreed to license their SEPs on discounted collective terms. They may offer to do so voluntarily (as they are in fact doing through the Platform), but they have not undertaken to do so and they cannot, in my judgment, be subjected to an English court&#8217;s examination and determination of the rate Avanci is offering.              </p>

In oral submissions, Mr Segan returned to his unamended Particulars of Claim and focussed on paragraph 40 where Tesla asserts a right to a licence on FRAND terms covering InterDigital&#8217;s SEPs (that is not, I think, of itself a controversial assertion), that it is a beneficiary of the FRAND commitments of all the Avanci 5G Platform members (again, that is probably not a controversial assertion) and then this: that Tesla is &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">accordingly</span>, entitled to a licence on FRAND terms covering the Avanci 5G Pool&#8221; (my emphasis).  The &#8220;accordingly&#8221; is not explained and I cannot see that it follows from the first two statements.  Tesla goes on, at paragraph 42 of its Particulars, to assert that &#8220;it would be impractical and onerous&#8221; for Tesla to have to negotiate bilateral licences with the individual SEP owners, and at paragraph 58 repeats the assertion that Tesla is entitled to enforce the FRAND commitment of each Avanci 5G Pool member, &#8220;by seeking a licence from and/or through Avanci covering the entirety of the Avanci 5G Pool&#8221; but again without explaining the basis for that asserted entitlement.  In short, I cannot identify any basis in Tesla&#8217;s pleaded case for suggesting that the SEP owners&#8217; FRAND obligations are to be transposed to, or read into, a licence granted by Avanci over its 5G Platform.    </p>

Indeed, the MLMA preserves each SEP owner&#8217;s right to offer and conclude bilateral licences with implementers.  There is no assumption by Avanci of the burden of the ETSI obligations; quite the contrary, the MLMA reflects a deliberate separation of the SEP owners&#8217; ETSI obligations owed to implementers (via the French law <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;stipulation pour autrui&#8221;</span>) from the deal struck by the SEP owners with Avanci permitting Avanci to offer their SEPs as part of a package on its platform.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, it follows that Tesla has a choice: it can take the Avanci 5G Platform licence at the offered rate; or, if it does not want to do that, it can negotiate a licence on FRAND terms with each of the SEP owners bilaterally.  But Tesla cannot legitimately claim to be entitled to the benefit of FRAND terms <span style="font-style:italic">as part of</span> the 5G Platform licence granted by Avanci.  This is to claim the &#8220;best of both&#8221; &#8211; which to Tesla is doubtless commercially attractive, but which is quite simply not on offer.  These are two commercial alternatives; they cannot be combined.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That separation is illustrated, if any illustration were needed, by the fact that Tesla has reached a bilateral agreement with L1, whose SEP licences are amongst those offered by Avanci as part of its 5G Platform licence, at the same time as engaging with Avanci about the price of its Platform licence.  This shows that the bilateral route remains open to Tesla.   It is also illustrated by the &#8220;debacle&#8221; of the telecoms licences which led to multiple bilateral agreements having to be negotiated between SEP owners and implementers. This again shows that the bilateral route remains open to Tesla.  It was to avoid the complexity of multiple bilateral negotiations that Avanci devised the &#8220;one-stop&#8221; 5G Platform licence.  Avanci&#8217;s product is not an implementation or variation of the ETSI arrangements to which the SEP owners are party.  It is a completely different commercial offering by way of alternative.  It follows that if Tesla wants the benefit of a SEP owner&#8217;s FRAND undertaking, it must pursue that entitlement against the SEP owner individually (as it has, in effect, done with L1).   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Third, commercial convenience (or avoiding an impractical outcome or onerous process) is not in my judgment, even arguably, a basis on which FRAND terms can be required of Avanci, because Avanci is not party to the ETSI arrangements.  If authority for that seemingly obvious proposition were needed, it is found in the Supreme Court&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Unwired Planet </span>at [14] which emphasises the bilateral nature of the SEP owner&#8217;s obligations to an implementer:</p>

It gives those parties the responsibility to resolve any disputes as to the validity of particular patents by agreement or by recourse to national courts for determination.&#8221;</p>

In that case, like this appeal, the appellant could not point to any legal right to a pool licence (in that case from Access Advance, in this case from Avanci); but still declarations were sought that such licences should be granted on FRAND terms.  Birss LJ dismissed Vestel&#8217;s appeal for reasons which are directly applicable here: there was no legal right in existence and Vestel&#8217;s claim was untethered to any legal standard (see para 79 of <span style="font-style:italic">Vestel</span>).  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fifth, I am not persuaded that the declarations sought would in any event meet the agreed baseline criteria of being useful and legitimate.  Any declaration which the Court might make in its discretion following a trial would, in my view, be to the effect that Tesla had no entitlement to FRAND terms from Avanci.  A declaration in those terms would not be useful because that conclusion can be delivered by a judgment of the Court at this stage without need of a trial.  Further, I doubt that any declaration would serve a legitimate purpose given the poverty of Tesla&#8217;s case, set against the potential time, cost and complexity of the proposed litigation.  </p>
