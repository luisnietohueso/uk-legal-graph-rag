It raises questions about: a barrister&#8217;s duty to plead weak arguments; reliance on counsel by a Law Centre in a Legal Aid context; causation of damage where a defence is argued unsuccessfully by a litigant-in-person after disinstructing the lawyers; limitation and valuation of a lost asset.

She says that if she had been advised properly, she never would have sold her Flat. Whilst the parties&#8217; expert surveyors agree the actual sale price of &#163;290,000 was its market value in July 2013, C has not found an appropriate alternative property. She claims for the lost value on the basis she would have kept the Flat: her expert Mr Dunsin values it now at &#163;440,000 but the Defendants&#8217; expert Mr Harris values it at &#163;425,000. There is also a pending application for permission to appeal on quantum evidence. </span></p>

It contains a hotch-potch of allegations many of which appear to be of dubious relevance. Others are very broadly and vaguely drafted and would benefit substantially from further particularisation. I indicated to the claimant that there is a limit to the extent to which &#8216;catch-all&#8217; drafting can be deployed as a vehicle through which otherwise unparticularised allegations may later be introduced. Obviously, any application to amend must be judged upon its merits and it would be premature for me to comment on the prospects of success.&#8221;</span></p>

The first is dated 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> April 2011 and covers the service charge for April 2011 to March 2012 of &#163;1,014.57, but also levies ground rent at the annual rate in the lease of &#163;10 (the &#8216;2011 Rent Invoice&#8217;). The second is dated 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> March 2012 and covers the service charge for April 2012 to March 2013 of &#163;1,190.79 and again levies ground rent of &#163;10 (the &#8216;2012 Rent Invoice&#8217;). The third is dated 12</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> February 2013 and similarly levies a service charge for 2013-2014 of &#163;1,173.12 and &#163;10 ground rent (the &#8216;2013 Rent Invoice&#8217;). (Fourthly, there is also a &#8216;major works&#8217; invoice for &#163;2,465.13 dated 12/02/13 but that is less critical). The relevance of the three Rent Invoices (especially the 2012 one) is that &#8211; as I shall explain below &#8211; they arguably gave C a defence to Southwark&#8217;s forfeiture claim on the basis it had waived the right to forfeit by charging </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">rent</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> (as opposed to service charges) after C&#8217;s breach of covenant for which it sought forfeiture. That breach was C&#8217;s failure to pay the service charges of &#163;7,815.09 once confirmed by the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal (&#8216;LVT&#8217;) in April 2011 (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">after</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> the 2011 Rent Invoice: which is why the 2012 and 2013 Rent Invoices are more important) - as ordered with interest and costs by the County Court in January 2012. Moreover, C paid Southwark &#163;3,000 on 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> April 2013, but that appears to have been attributed to the existing debt on the service charges, rather than being allocated to rent. </span></p>

Paragraph 15 of C&#8217;s Particulars of Claim alleges the Defendants were negligent in their: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;Failure of D1/D2 to determine and advise the Landlord waived its right to forfeit in accordance with the Lease&#8230; it served demands for ground rent / service charges &#8230;.continuously from 24/04/2005&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. That paragraph went on to a separate point about the validity of notice of forfeiture (which is on the List of Issues at (a)(iv)).

However, I permitted that point to be added as a late but minor amendment which did not unfairly prejudice the Defendants, who said the argument lacked merit (although I considered it had realistic as opposed to fanciful prospects of success). So, I add the following issues: were the Defendants negligent in failing to investigate or determine and advise whether waiver of right to forfeit on grounds of levying ground rent in the 2011-2013 Rent Invoices ?</span></p>

She was enmeshed in that with Southwark relating to service charges since 2004, around the time she paid her mortgage off on the Flat which she had purchased in 1999. She was involved in an incident at work in 2007, causing both a physical and a psychological disability for which she receives Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit and has not been able to work since. Indeed, from 2007-2012, she was not capable of doing any work or even studying on a bed, which is the reason she said she involved solicitors in the forfeiture proceedings. She was candid that at least since then, in the two phases of this dispute &#8211; for the first decade or so with Southwark directly; and the last decade with Ds - she had spent a great deal of time working on it, although she needs to do so resting on her back in a bed. This long immersion in the case has three consequences.    </span></p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The first is a practical consequence. The two decades of this dispute have generated a huge volume of documentation. I have a bundle consisting of two large boxes of lever arch files of over 1000 pages. As typical in a trial, I was only referred to some of those. I have relied on the C &#8211; who knows this case better than anyone &#8211; and Counsel to refer me to all relevant documents. However, as I had a reading day, I was able to go beyond the reading list and at least skim read every page of the whole bundle. So, I believe I have identified most of the relevant documents in my &#8216;working bundle&#8217;, although I supplemented it with all the relevant documents I was referred to in evidence. However, in this judgment, I will not refer to every single document I have read, but I confirm that I have taken them all into account in reaching my findings and conclusions. </span></p>

She bristled when she was asked about the GCRO in 2017 and said whilst Southwark obtained it, she now has a good relationship with them. Ironically, C has come to forgive the authority who effectively forced her out her home with whom she was embroiled in litigation almost non-stop from 2009 to 2017. Instead, she has come to blame the lawyers who advised her for less than a year, albeit the crucial time when she lost her Flat: from Summer 2012 to Summer 2013. It is clear C has never really recovered from losing her Flat. She told me she ruled out another leasehold property as she could not bear to go through forfeiture again and she has not found an appropriate freehold property. So, she is now a tenant of the authority that evicted her.    </span></p>

I have no doubt whatsoever that she was an honest witness &#8211; she clearly believed the truth of what she was telling me. Indeed, on several topics - including the key Rent Invoices issue, she candidly accepted she did not really remember key information &#8211; such as whether she had given the 2011-2013 Rent Invoices to D1. However, that did not stop her making assertions in evidence that contradicted contemporary documentation &#8211; e.g. D1&#8217;s attendance notes and letters in January 2013 that C refused to agree for Southwark to have a charge on the Flat pending sale. Her recollection also shifted in cross-examination. Initially, she claimed she had &#8216;agreed&#8217; with Southwark to pay &#163;20 a week to the service charge arrears throughout 2012, but later accepted Southwark had never actually agreed (indeed, letters at time suggest they actively rejected it). Therefore, I do not find parts of C&#8217;s evidence reliable.    </span></p>

Judges may have preconceptions of a litigant-in-person who has previously had a GCRO, but whatever those preconceptions, Ms Christie confounded them. She gave evidence in a courteous and measured way. I gave her the chance after her evidence had finished to reflect overnight and to ask to give further evidence the next day on anything she had missed, that she took in a limited and fair manner. Her recall of some detail (consistent with contemporaneous evidence but without needing to be reminded of it) was impressive. This is particularly true of the earliest stages of the dispute, well before the Defendants became involved. Yet C said herself that by the time of the forfeiture proceedings in 2012-2013, she was under immense stress, which is borne out in contemporary notes of her emotional state, affecting her ability to listen to advice. Whilst C no longer pursues her pleaded argument that she lacked litigation capacity at the time, her stress plainly affected her </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">judgement at</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> the time as well as her </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">recollection</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">of</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> the time.

	  <content>
	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">By contrast, Ms Twigg&#8217;s evidence was straightforward &#8211; if limited. She was not involved in advising C but investigated the complaint later. As Ms Twigg explained, C was actually represented by two solicitors working in 2012-13 for D1: Susan Holman (who has retired) and Sarah Talboys, who now works elsewhere. Ms Twigg has spoken to them and more than a decade on, neither have any recollection of C&#8217;s case independent of D1&#8217;s file, so Ms Twigg gave evidence on behalf of D1. She clearly had some familiarity with C&#8217;s case from investigating her complaint. Ms Twigg made appropriate concessions, including about Ms Holman&#8217;s expertise in debt (if not in leasehold) and struck me as a straightforward reliable witness. She was responsible for providing D1&#8217;s file to C in 2016 (and took copies) and affirmed it did not include the 2011, 2012 or 2013 Rent Invoices. I also heard briefly from D1&#8217;s solicitor Mrs Oldfield who confirmed her firm had also checked D1&#8217;s file for the 2011 and 2012 Rent Invoices (they had not checked for the 2013 one) and could not find them. This is not so surprising when &#8211; as D1&#8217;s briefs to Mr Dymond said at the time &#8211; at the time C was not opening all her post because she was so stressed by the forfeiture proceedings. C herself could not remember whether she handed over the 2011-2013 Rent Invoices. I will find C never handed them over to D1, which is why they are not on its file. It therefore follows that Mr Dymond would never have seen the Rent Invoices either, as he said. </span></p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I found Mr Dymond a straightforward and fair witness. He readily accepted the 2012 Rent Invoice would have provided a complete defence &#8211; without trying to avoid that conclusion, but insisted he had not seen it, otherwise he would have run that argument, which I accept. He explained his advice and view on other issues fairly and in detail. Mr Dymond&#8217;s expertise in the field was evident in his evidence, but what was also evident was his patience and courtesy to C, who in turn was courteous, although that did not stop her from asking searching questions, which I developed with him. Mr Dymond fairly accepted several points Ms Christie put to him without trying to avoid them or bog them down in legal technicalities. As well as his commendably straightforward concession that had he seen the 2012 Rent Invoice, he would have advised it gave C a defence, he accepted his view of the &#163;20 payments had been different from the view of a District Judge who had directed evidence about it before his instruction; and that the first notice of forfeiture from Southwark was technically invalid. Moreover, he accepted that Southwark had agreed generous loans with other leaseholders secured by land charges for them to repay loans in excess of &#163;30,000 over several years. Yet he also clearly explained why he had not advised seeking relief from forfeiture on that basis. As he pointed out, Southwark had been much more aggressive in its determination to repossess C&#8217;s Flat. Mr Dymond believed Southwark would never have agreed to such a loan, or even time to pay (and indeed contemporary evidence he had not seen at the time proves that it had already refused C such a loan). Therefore, Mr Dymond explained his view that had C sought relief from forfeiture in the form of a loan from Southwark allowing her to keep the Flat in the face of Southwark opposition to it, the Court would never have granted it &#8211; as he said &#8211; in all his experience he had never known a Court make such an order. I will have to evaluate later whether Mr Dymond&#8217;s advice was negligent, but I have no doubt at all that his honest and fair evidence was factually reliable and I have no hesitation in accepting it in preference to C&#8217;s more coloured perspective where they disagree. </span></p>

However, this is less of an issue for the earlier stages of the dispute &#8211; before the forfeiture proceedings began in 2012. </span></p>

The essential complaint was that since the caretaker had left, Pallant House had not been properly cleaned and its condition had deteriorated. Southwark Arbitration Tribunal upheld this complaint and found Southwark in breach of the Lease and ordered it to paint the tenants&#8217; external doors, windows and balconies, to investigate whether asbestos existed on the balconies and to pay compensation of &#163;500 each.

Despite that, C did not pay the service charge &#8211; she only offered half which Southwark did not accept. She paid nothing towards it even after she paid off her mortgage in 2004.

Secondly, on 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> January 2012 (strictly too early as I explain later), Southwark issued its first notice of forfeiture for breach of the lease by C for non-payment of the judgment debt plus additional costs, requiring C to repay the sum in full within 21 days. In her letter of 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">rd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> January 2012, C asked the Court for a stay of proceedings on grounds of her health and explained she had set up the standing order for &#163;20 pw. Ironically, as Mr Dymond observed in evidence, the fact C had already paid off the mortgage left her in a worse position on this point than if she still had a mortgage, because she could not simply seek additional lending from her mortgage company as other leaseholders could. Moreover, whilst as C later discovered, Southwark had agreed to other leaseholders servicing much higher debts with voluntary charges (in a couple of cases, even in excess of &#163;30,000), or with long-term loans (in two cases, higher debts with repayments of only &#163;12 and &#163;15 per week), Southwark was showing no such indulgence to C, possibly because she had on principle not made any service charge payments, or asked for loans, from 2005 to 2012.   </span></p>

Ms Twigg&#8217;s research suggested that between January 2010 and December 2013, D1 opened 1,250 files relating to debt, but only 16 cases (1.3%) concerned service charge arrears and forfeiture. Having said that, it is clear this was an increasing area of demand, as D1 arranged for training on leasehold law and forfeiture from Mr Dymond and a colleague.

However, as I have found, C had not opened those letters and did not give them to D1. Indeed, that finding is consistent with the fact that neither C nor D1 challenged Southwark&#8217;s assertion that it had not demanded rent, which as Mr Dymond said, would be standard practice for a landlord pursuing forfeiture &#8211; to avoid waiving it. The waiver raised by DJ Pearce and C&#8217;s instructions and squarely alleged by D1 to Southwark which it rejected was not waiver based on demand for rent, but alleged acceptance of the &#163;20 payments.  Therefore, because C had not opened the Rent Invoices or given them to D1 to open, there was a missed opportunity to raise a defence based on waiver by Southwark, at least in relation to the 2012 Rent Invoice, as I shall explain later. </span></p>

This was entirely appropriate. Whilst I will have to consider the allegations against him, his reputation and expertise was (and remains) unquestionable. Mr Dymond was called to the Bar in 1991 and practiced from the start in Landlord and Tenant Law. Indeed in 1993, he joined the specialist Housing set, Arden Chambers, under Andrew Arden QC. Mr Dymond then assisted Mr Arden with what I am aware from my own experience of Housing Law is the leading law report in the field, the Housing Law Reports (of which they are now co-editors). Mr Dymond and Mr Arden also co-wrote textbooks on Housing Law, including Manual of Housing Law, published in 2012 (latest edition 2020). Mr Dymond was recognised by Chambers and Partners as a Leading Junior and is a member of all relevant professional associations. Mr Dymond was an appropriate choice of Counsel by Ms Holman. Doubtless he was in her mind due to the training he and a colleague gave on forfeiture earlier in 2012.    </span></p>

Unlike mortgage repossession of freehold or leasehold property where the mortgage company repossesses the property, sells it and accounts to the former owner for any balance, with forfeiture of a long lease, the leaseholder can lose a valuable asset (especially if mortgage free as C was) which is worth far more than the debt they owe. This is why it is so imperative to avoid forfeiture &#8211; whether by a defence to it, an application for relief from it, or otherwise by selling the property at least to retain the equity less the debt.   </span></p>

In this case, we are not concerned with payments of rent because the service charges were not reserved as rent. The acceptance of rent falls into a special category. If there has been payment of rent, the courts do not look at the circumstances to see if there can be another explanation for payment. In the context of payment of service charges, however, the court is free to look at all the circumstances to consider whether it was so unequivocal that it can only be regarded as having been done consistently with the continued existence of the lease: Yorkshire Metropolitan Properties v Co-Operative (1997)&#8230;.In this case, given that the payments were accepted by way of standing order at a time when the Council had served notice under s.146, I do not consider that a court would find that there had been waiver. </span></p>

That is not an issue. All that Ms Christie can do is obtain relief from forfeiture. Relief will only be granted where a leaseholder pays: (i) the arrears which form the basis of the forfeiture proceedings (i.e. the arrears in the s.146 notice); (ii) all the landlord&#8217;s costs; and (iii) any arrears which have accrued subsequent to the s.146 notice. This includes the current year&#8217;s service charges. (For a clear case on this, see Martin v Maryland Estates (2000) 32 HLR 116 (CA)). </span></p>

If she does not sell it, then the Council will get a possession order and she will lose her only asset, which is a very substantial one. It is crucial this is avoided at all costs. That does not mean that, by paying the sums due, Ms Christie loses her rights in respect of them. Paragraph 2 of the draft order records that if she pays them, the sums are not agreed or admitted by her. This was included specifically to protect her rights to challenge the amount of the service charge. She can, therefore pay the service charges but later challenge them in the LVT. She can even do this after the property has been sold. I have no details at all as to what arguments she has about the current service charges and so cannot comment on the strength of any application. I do observe however that some service charges are bound to be payable. The only issue will be the amount&#8230;..</span></p>

It removes the real risk that the Court may order possession. In principle, the Council are entitled to the current service charges as a term of relief. In any event, the current service charges need to be paid to enable a sale. Ms Christie can always challenge the service charges in the LVT at a later date (even after the property has been sold). If there is a hearing on Friday, her equity in the flat will reduce still further. In my view the position could not be clearer.&#8221;     </span></p>

However, this was not evidence, not put to D&#8217;s witnesses and had no written evidence to support it and I do not accept it).

It was a long hearing, with the transcript of proceedings running to 39 pages. Mr Walsh, Counsel for Southwark, set out the history. Notably, DDJ Couch had some experience in Property Law and asked Mr Walsh whether there had been any new rent demands and was told (presumably as Mr Walsh had been told by Southwark) that there were not, which was wrong. Indeed, a few minutes later, C interrupted to say that new sums had been demanded. However, C did not develop any argument based on waiver through new rent demands. Her point was still waiver through the &#163;20 payments, as DJ Pearce considered in June 2012. Mr Walsh for Southwark directly said DJ Pearce had been wrong, but in any event had not determined that there had been waiver (and the latter was correct). Just before DDJ Couch gave judgment, there was discussion of the possibility of a loan from Southwark, which Mr Walsh said &#8216;was not for consideration&#8217; and which C said had been refused. </span></p>

In such circumstances it would be surprising if every such piece of advice were reasoned with as much comprehensive precision as may be applied in hindsight by an appellate tribunal which has had the benefit of extensive argument and leisurely reflection. Since the decision in Hall, advocates have been liable to their clients for negligence in the same way as other professional persons. It would not be in the interests of those clients if they were compelled by the effect of over-prescriptive decisions to adopt a practice of defensive advocacy in the conduct of litigation or advising litigants about the course to be taken&#8230;[I]t would be unfortunate if [barristers] felt they had to hedge their opinions about with qualifications. It would be equally unfortunate if another effect of the same syndrome were to be an abdication of responsibility for decisions relating to the conduct of litigation and a reluctance to give clients the advice which they require in their own best interests.&#160;Nor do I consider that to give clients a catalogue of every factor which might affect the course of action to be adopted... would be a productive discharge of advocates' duty to give them proper advice.</span></p>

In holding, as this court does, that [the judge below] has erred in the latter of these directions, we ought also to recognise his desire to maintain a high standard of professional trustworthiness. The law does not, however, demand either omniscience or infallibility in lawyers any more than it does in doctors or architects. The law&#8217;s standard of reasonable competence means not only that there will be errors which are not compensable but that legal advisers are not expected to divine every claim that a client may theoretically have. The barrister said: &#8216;You are suggesting that it was my obligation to tell [my client] that he might have an action against somebody who I thought had not been negligent for losing something which I never thought he had.

He may either choose to enforce his right of forfeiture, and to treat the lease as being at an end; or he may choose not to enforce his right of forfeiture and to treat the lease as continuing to exist. In this respect the landlord is in no different position from that of a party to a contract who, faced with a repudiatory breach of contract, may choose either to accept the repudiation or to affirm the contract. &#8216;Waiver&#8217; of forfeiture takes place where the landlord chooses to treat the lease as continuing to exist or, in other words, where the landlord affirms the contract. It is based on the doctrine of election. It is possible for a landlord to waive the right to forfeit even before the landlord is in a position to exercise the right, for example, because the landlord has yet to comply with the requirements of s.146 of the Law of Property Act 1925 or s.81 of the Housing Act 1996 or s.168 of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002: Stemp v 6 Ladbroke Grove Management [2019] L &amp; TR 10 (UT)&#8230;. Waiver of the right to forfeit is not the same as waiver of a breach of covenant. The former depends on the principle of election and only bars one remedy, leaving the landlord&#8217;s right to damages intact. The latter depends upon the inference of consent, and bars all the landlord&#8217;s remedies in respect of the breach in question. Neither of these kinds of waiver will prevent the landlord from relying on the covenant in respect of subsequent breaches.  Furthermore, waiver in respect of continuing as opposed to once for all breaches of covenant will not prevent a subsequent forfeiture.&#8221;</span></p>

However, it is entirely unnecessary because if there is a public law defence against a local authority landlord, then it can be raised as a tenant as a defence to possession proceedings in the County Court: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Wandsworth LBC v Winder</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> [1985] AC 461 (HL). The real question was whether there was any public law defence available to C. The only one Mr Dymond specifically considered was a defence under the Equality Act 2010, but rightly there is no criticism by C of his rejection of such a defence. Whilst C is clearly &#8217;disabled&#8217; for the purposes of s.6 of the 2010 Act, there was no arguable disability discrimination or failure to comply with the public sector equality duty under s.149. Moreover, C was not clear on what her suggested public law defence might be, other than to suggest Southwark&#8217;s decision to seek forfeiture was irrational. However, given that it had a Court judgment for outstanding service charge arrears, forfeiture was plainly a rational option, even if it was pursued with more zeal against C than others. Even if this was motivated by her previous challenges to service charges, she had not paid a judgment. Given that, it was not even arguably irrational or unlawful to forfeit. </span></p>

I would go further. I am not even convinced that C understood what she was alleging. It started out as a complaint (as stated in the List of Issues) that there was a &#8216;right to a rent contribution&#8217; under p.3 schedule 9 of the ESA Regulations. That is plainly wrong: p.3 simply sets out a capital disregard for 26 weeks after sale of a property &#8211; which is why Ms Holman mentioned it to C in January 2013 - it had nothing to do with her suggesting a &#8216;rent contribution&#8217;. Indeed, C appeared to acknowledge this in evidence and instead suggested that because of the capital disregard, she would be entitled to Housing Benefit which Southwark would have had to pay, it could have been used as &#8216;leverage&#8217;. However, the problem with that, as Mr Dymond rightly said, is that Southwark were taking a very hard line with C, to the point of re-starting possession proceedings. It is unlikely they would have been dissuaded by the risk of having to pay Housing Benefit because (i) it was primarily funded by central government; (ii) came out of a different departmental budget (and as this case shows, the left hand in Southwark often did not appreciate what the right hand was doing); and most importantly: (iii) Southwark would be getting a valuable asset &#8211; a flat in a good location which they could in due course sell and in the meantime use as valuable stock for emergency or homeless housing. Therefore, it is entirely unsurprising (and certainly not negligent) that Mr Dymond did not consider raising this argument, which again would have been bound to fail. </span></p>

Certainly, the suggestion that Southwark could have been persuaded to change its mind is totally untenable.

It was entirely consistent with the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re Debtors</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> (which Mr Dymond cited, later approved in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Faiz</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">) that payments of sums accruing </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">before</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> the right to forfeit could be accepted without waiving that right. In this case, C&#8217;s &#163;20 payments were all allocated to the judgment debt, as was Southwark&#8217;s right (he did not refer to authority for it, but it is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Cory Bros</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">).

Even if that is incorrect, as Mr Maxwell submitted, even if service charge demands in 2005-2008 were waived by later ones, failure to pay the 2009 demand was a new breach which was not waived, indeed led immediately to the service charge proceedings and judgment debt (see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Woodfall</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> at p.17-092). Also, as Mr Dymond said, this was a service charge to which the strict &#8216;rent rule&#8217; does not apply as confirmed by </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Co-Operative</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">; and there was no unequivocal waiver by accepting the &#163;20 given the terms of letters and comments by Mr Strauss at the time.

However, there is a distinct question whether he was negligent not to raise and plead the &#163;20 payments waiver point anyway (and not to contest a recital by DJ Worthington at the hearing on 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> November that Southwark had a right to forfeit) given DJ Pearce&#8217;s view that waiver was arguable and C&#8217;s reluctance to accept his advice (although she eventually did). However, in my view Mr Dymond was not negligent in that respect either, for three alternative reasons:</span></p>

Mr Dymond knew Mr Brown would take DJ Worthington to the same legal principles as Mr Dymond had discussed in his Advice at the hearing on 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> November and explain why there was no waiver defence. (C rightly did not argue DJ Pearce&#8217;s decision created an issue estoppel that waiver was &#8216;arguable&#8217;: circumstances had since totally changed given the refund of the payments, new notice etc). So, Mr Dymond was entitled to advise C in conference the waiver defence would not succeed. Given the true legal analysis and Southwark&#8217;s evidence including Mr Strauss&#8217; letters, whether or not Mr Dymond said it, the defence was bound to fail, so would have been contrary to his professional duties to plead: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Buxton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.</span></p>

After all, Mr Dymond did not have the transcript of DJ Pearce&#8217;s comments (or even her order), so could not have shown the Judge what DJ Pearce had said. The stakes were simply too high: if waiver was rejected by the Judge (as Mr Dymond believed it would be and as it was in the end by DDJ Couch), a possession order would almost certainly follow and the chance for C to have time to sell could be lost, along with her only asset (since Mr Dymond &#8211; rightly &#8211; did not consider any other relief application to be arguable as it stood). Indeed, that course might have been negligent. It was certainly not negligent to advise C to seek an adjournment to sell the Flat (or find a third-party loan). Notably, DJ Worthington took some persuasion even to adjourn and agreed Southwark had a right to forfeiture before he even checked whether Mr Dymond objected to that recital (to which he could not realistically). </span></p>

Mr Dymond said in 2012/2013 the point would have been arguable and likely appealed either way). By contrast, the 2013 Rent Invoice was issued in February 2013 during the second forfeiture proceedings and therefore would not waive forfeiture. However, as Mr Dymond also readily accepted, if he had known about the 2012 Rent Invoice, he would have pleaded waiver &#8211; indeed it would have been negligent not to have done so. </span></p>

Whilst this is an evaluative issue of negligence not a simple issue of fact, I equally have no hesitation in deciding Mr Dymond was not at all negligent in failing to investigate and discover any of the Rent Invoices (including the 2012 one) for five reasons, one overarching and others spanning the four points in time when he was instructed to act:</span></p>

And while he knew the Lease required rent to be paid, it was common practice for landlords to pause rent (and service charge) demands when pursuing forfeiture. Given Mr Dymond was advising that rent demands waived forfeiture, he was entitled to proceed on the basis that he would be told if there had been rent demands.

Yet even if C had not said what she now claims, she said nothing to suggest she received new rent demands. Moreover, Mr Dymond was also entitled to rely on the fact Southwark were saying there had been none and to trust in the duties to the Court owed by his opponent Counsel Mr Brown that he would have said if he had known that Southwark&#8217;s statements were wrong.

By that time, the 2013 Rent Invoice had been issued and whilst I accept he was not told about that invoice &#8211; still less provided with it &#8211; he was told Southwark were insisting on including &#8216;the current service charge&#8217;. Had Mr Dymond asked to see it and C had provided it, he would have seen the demand for Ground Rent and whilst the 2013 Rent Invoice would not waive forfeiture, that could well have prompted him to ask about the 2012 Rent Invoice which he might have discovered did so. I pressed both Mr Dymond in evidence and Mr Maxwell in submissions about this point (which really lay behind my decision at the start of trial to grant C permission to amend to allege negligent &#8216;non-investigation&#8217; of Rent Invoices). However, Mr Dymond was being asked to advise about adding </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">service charges</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> to the debt not rent; and demand of service charges (especially during current proceedings) does not constitute waiver in the same way as rent (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Co-Operative</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">).  In any event, as Mr Dymond explained, not only was it standard for current service charges to be included in an application for relief from forfeiture (as he advised in April 2013 citing</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> Martin</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">), it would be standard for service charges to continue to accrue (and to be demanded of other leaseholders) even if not demanded of a leaseholder facing forfeiture. Therefore, Mr Maxwell was justified in submitting that even in April 2013 Mr Dymond was not told anything that would have put him on notice that C had been </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">sent </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">a service charge demand in 2013, let alone a rent one (or even less obviously previous rent ones). There was no &#8216;chain of enquiry&#8217; from the existence of the 2013 service charge back to previous Rent Invoices which would have revealed waiver. I accept that submission and I find Mr Dymond was not negligent not to investigate whether there had been any demands for rent, even when advising in April 2013. </span></p>

Indeed, I go further. I have set out what I hope are detailed findings of fact which exonerate Mr Dymond from any criticism whatsoever. He was not given crucial information and gave exemplary advice on the information he had. If C had not followed his initial advice to put the Flat up for sale, there is every chance it would have been forfeited in November 2012 by DJ Worthington, who had to be persuaded to adjourn it to allow a sale and was more than willing to recite he was satisfied there was a right to forfeit before asking Mr Dymond. If it had been forfeited in November 2012 not June 2013, C would have been left with nothing and no prospect of a sale, still less any sort of realistic application for relief. As it is, because of Mr Dymond, she saved the equity in her Flat, if not sadly the Flat itself. I can entirely understand why C may have felt bitter for a long time towards Southwark (even if that cannot excuse her conduct which led to the GCRO). But I struggle to understand why she ever came to blame Mr Dymond for trying to help her as he did. In fairness to C, to the extent her blame of him was fuelled by her misunderstandings about potential arguments that could have been run (which were in truth hopeless); and why his view was different from DJ Pearce&#8217;s months earlier; and why he never advised her to run a defence on the Rent Invoices, I have spent as long as I have in explaining this to her in the hope, which may be forlorn, that she will come to accept it. However, even if she does not, I can take the opportunity to say clearly Mr Dymond has been waiting over a decade to clear his name of these allegations and he has emphatically done so.  </span></p>

Having found that Mr Dymond was not negligent, to the extent that D1 could rely on his opinion, it too is not negligent. Likewise, just as I have found the complaints of negligence against Mr Dymond relating to the &#163;20 Payment waiver, Service Charge Loan, ESAR and Judicial Review fail against him, I will also find they fail against D1.

Firstly, as I shall explain, the reliance principle is that in certain circumstances, solicitors are entitled to rely on a barrister&#8217;s advice. However, with the Rent Invoices issue, Mr Dymond&#8217;s advice of 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> November 2012 was that rent demands waived forfeiture. From that time (even if not earlier) D1 were aware of that principle and the critical significance of any new demands for rent C may have given it or told it about. Secondly, the primary way C puts the Rent Invoice allegation against D1 is that she gave the 2011, 2012 and 2013 Rent Invoices to D1. Just because I have found Mr Dymond was not given them and did not know (nor ought to have known) about them, it does not follow that D1 itself did not know nor ought to have known about them. D1 may simply &#8211; but itself negligently - not have told or shown them to Mr Dymond. Thirdly, when the issue is the factual one of whether lawyers were told about a particular &#8216;smoking gun&#8217; document such as the 2012 Rent Invoice here &#8211; it is the solicitors who are primarily in the frame, not the barrister. If anything, the barrister is generally (subject to the &#8216;investigation&#8217; point I have already considered) entitled to rely on what she is given or told about by the solicitor. If anything, the &#8216;reliance principle&#8217; works rather the other way around.</span></p>

Yet at no point did C raise the existence of rent demands, even when complaining about the 2013 service charge. They could assume C would be forthcoming with information and her views &#8211; they had to deal with the robust expression of those views regularly. Yet C never mentioned receiving rent invoices, so they were not put on enquiry.</span></p>

That will be a particular issue for specialist Legal Aid solicitors who need a barrister&#8217;s advice on a technical point that does not commonly occur in the normal run of their caseload, since unlike solicitors in large commercial firms, they cannot simply refer the client to a colleague in the relevant department, as there probably will not be one.

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In my judgement, that is precisely the position in the present case. As C rightly argued, Ms Holman and Ms Talboys were specialists in debt and housing (and Ms Holman in welfare benefits too). As Turner J also noted, the Mary Ward Centre held itself out as having specialism in housing and debt - and I would add, did indeed have that specialism. As he added, this is doubtless why the Duty Solicitor Ms Pearce referred C to Ms Holman, whom she knew as a former colleague. However, whilst I have not heard from Ms Holman and Ms Talboys, I accept Ms Twigg&#8217;s evidence that they and D1 generally had very little experience in the technicalities of leases and relief against forfeiture. That issue simply only rarely arose in the more typical social housing cases they conducted. Therefore, it was wise of Ms Holman and Ms Talboys to instruct a true specialist in that field - Mr Dymond - and in my judgement, they were entitled to rely on his advice. It is clear they also exercised their own individual judgment. Ms Holman in November 2012 directed C to equity release schemes with which she was familiar from her specialism in debt and in January 2012 checked with Mr Dymond whether the Equality Act 2010 might afford a defence. Ms Talboys specifically instructed Mr Dymond for the fourth time in April 2013 on the service charge issue but then continued to deal with C herself. However, neither of them had significant experience of forfeiture generally, let alone the technical issue of waiver on which Mr Dymond had advised. As it happens, as I have found, that advice was not only not negligent but entirely sound in any event. </span></p>

Therefore, &#8216;the reliance principle&#8217; has no real application to these points (as opposed to the two waiver points on which he did advise and which D1 was entitled to rely: the &#163;20 payment waiver point and the discontinuance waiver point).

She never asked them to follow that up with Southwark. In any event, it was always hopeless for the reasons discussed. A far better source for a loan would have been &#8216;equity release&#8217; (since C had plenty of equity) which Ms Holman specifically raised with C but which C has not said that she did anything about. Even if she did explore it and it was refused, that simply underlines that the only realistic option was for C to sell her Flat to avoid forfeiture of it. </span></p>

However, Ms Holman never told C there as a &#8216;rent contribution&#8217; because there was not one - that was C&#8217;s misunderstanding. Nevertheless, the ESA rule would have enabled C to sell her Flat but not lose her benefits. This was an example of Ms Holman actively helping C. </span></p>

Ms Holman, Ms Talboys and D1 were more than &#8216;reasonably competent&#8217; as practitioners in the fields of debt and housing. They recognised when they needed specialist input from Counsel and got it. They patiently took C&#8217;s instructions (even when intemperately expressed as in January 2013). They dealt efficiently and effectively with Southwark and the Court, skilfully negotiating consent orders (including Ms Talboys drafting the consent order in April which Mr Dymond rightly noted preserved C&#8217;s rights to challenge the service charge). Indeed, Ms Talboys even offered to assist C with an application for relief from forfeiture after C had dis-instructed D1, which went above and beyond the call of duty. In my view, as with Mr Dymond, it is regrettable that C has come to blame the Mary Ward Centre (a legal charity providing invaluable assistance to vulnerable people such as herself) for Southwark&#8217;s actions &#8211; albeit in response to C&#8217;s own decision of principle not to pay service charges for several years. I acquit the Mary Ward Centre of any negligence. </span></p>

I have explained that was not realistic, but even if he was negligent not to do so, that was only DDJ Couch&#8217;s second reason for rejecting the waiver defences. His primary reason was the same as Mr Dymond&#8217;s analysis &#8211; that payments towards a pre-existing judgment debt did not unequivocally recognise the continuing existence of the lease. It would be very odd if a judge dismissed an argument for similar reasons as a barrister advised against running it, yet their disgruntled client could still argue the defence had a more than negligible prospect of success even though it failed.

Lord Lloyd-Jones said that if a claim was negligently not made and would have succeeded on the available evidence at the time, the defendant solicitors could not rely on subsequent medical evidence suggesting the injury was not as grave as it first appeared, at least in the absence of dishonesty as in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Perry. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This was because if a claim had been made, the scheme would not have sought such further medical evidence.

By analogy in my judgment so too would the actual result of the actual trial, provided the argument did not fail because of the negligence. This applies as much to a situation where a litigant-in-person ran the point which failed as it would if new solicitors ran the point which failed.

In those circumstances, the prospects of success would depend not on legal merit, but on whether Southwark made the right argument, the chance they might not do so would have been very slim &#8211; no more than 15% at most. </span></p>

Moreover, if C had issued proceedings in March 2019, just after the GCRO expired, she would have been in time. She has not explained why she did not do so.

The expert valuation evidence of Mr Dunsin for C and Mr Harris for the Defendants agreed that C sold her Flat for the market value in July 2013 of &#163;290,000. Moreover, Mr Dunsin and Mr Harris agreed there were both leasehold and freehold properties available for C to purchase in the Southwark borough of London in 2013-2015 for a price range of &#163;200,000 to &#163;275,000. The only issue of disagreement between the experts was the extent the Flat had risen in value since. On that issue, Mr Dunsin estimated the Flat&#8217;s value in October 2024 as &#163;450,000 (although he accepted &#163;440,000 would be a reasonable price). Mr Harris considered the value of the Flat would be &#163;410,000 to &#163;425,000. This is not a dramatic differential in price. </span></p>

When a property is lost through lawyers&#8217; negligence, the loss is normally assessed by looking at the market value of that property at that point, not its market value at some later date taking into account movement in the market. As Arden LJ (as she was) said, assessing value at some other date of the claimant&#8217;s choosing would cause uncertainty as there would be no finite date for loss. Therefore, the value of the lost asset in July 2013 was &#163;290,000 and the claimant got &#163;290,000, so she has not suffered a (recoverable) loss of value in the Flat. </span></p>

D1&#8217;s retainer was to represent C in the forfeiture proceedings and assist her to keep the Flat or its equity, not advise her about a development opportunity. Moreover, the scope of Mr Dymond&#8217;s duty was even more focussed on the specific instructions he had. The Flat&#8217;s 2024 value was simply outside the scope of their duties. </span></p>

C decided not to purchase an alternative as she could have done. I prefer not to analyse that as an issue of mitigation of loss, nor get into the emotive territory of whether C was reasonable in ruling out leasehold properties as she did. However, as Lords Hodge and Sales explained in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Manchester</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> at [6], losses are only recoverable if they are caused by the negligence, not some new effective cause and are not too remote.  It was not foreseeable for the Defendants that C would not use the proceeds of sale to buy an alternative property &#8211; that was the very advice that Mr Dymond gave and which D1 supported. Therefore, C&#8217;s decision not to use the funds to buy an alternative &#8211; understandable or not &#8211; broke the chain or causation from any negligence and was too remote. </span></p>

I need not consider them in detail because those losses are irrecoverable for the same reason and in any event are insufficiently evidenced. Likewise, the costs of sale are accounted for as a necessary cost that would have been borne at some point in any event. Therefore, even had C succeeded, I would not have awarded any more than nominal compensation. However, as it is, I dismiss the claim in its entirety. </span></p>

Mr Dymond and D1 gave good advice which enabled C to rescue the equity in her property avoiding C losing her only asset. Whilst these proceedings have been dragging on for over five years, they have resulted in the Defendants exoneration of any wrongdoing. I appreciate that will be bitterly disappointing for C and the loss of her Flat has consumed more than a decade of her life because she loved it as not just a financial investment but as her home. I understand her anger that it was taken from her by Southwark when she actually had a good defence. It was no-one&#8217;s fault that was not deployed: she was very stressed and so did not tell the Defendants, who were blameless. </span></p>
