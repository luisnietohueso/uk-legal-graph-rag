You should have checked it was secure, and/or asked your colleague if it was secure before you moved away, and not assume your colleague had done it. Whilst you stated your colleague was the 'lead carer' you still had equal responsibility for the welfare of the service user.</span></p>

You had worked with the service user for 3-4 weeks and was therefore aware that she was non-communicative and could not indicate her pain or injuries. Despite you seeing the bruising to her face you did not suggest to your colleague you seek medical attention nor did you get an ice pack to help with the swelling. You could not have known, at that point in time, the extent of any injuries caused and should have sought assistance to ensure there were no other more serious injuries which were not visible. It is therefore concerning that you stated you followed your colleagues lead despite having been trained on the appropriate course of action to take and the obvious need for the service user to receive further attention. You have therefore demonstrated a lack of insight into the harmfulness of your behaviour.</span></p>

You had already confirmed you had left the home without providing a clear account of the incident. You therefore failed to report it accurately to others. It is concerning that you have demonstrated an attitude that your behaviour was ok because you were following your colleagues lead, despite knowing this was incorrect. </span></p>

It's acknowledged that you have since undertaken work in a classroom since September 2022, however there is no evidence that you've encountered any similar situations and been able to demonstrate that you can react without panicking or that you can challenge poor practice when you witnesses it. </span></p>

This demonstrates a lack of insight/understanding into the need for you to</span><span> </span><span style="font-family:Arial">speak up against poor practices which may place vulnerable adults at risk. You had a responsibility to challenge your colleague, even if she was the 'lead' carer, when you knew what your colleague was doing was wrong, was harmful and was against policy and procedures. The DBS are concerned that you may not report harmful behaviour in regulated activity in the future, if you were subservient, or if you had established relationships/loyalties with colleagues who may perpetrate harmful behaviour. </span></p>

		    <p class="Numbered" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-family:Arial">As such the DBS are satisfied that you carried out neglectful behaviour which caused and had the potential to cause significant harm to a vulnerable adult - you ignored a service user's medical and physical care needs and failed to challenge your colleague's harmful behaviour. </span></p>

However, given your most recent conduct the DBS are concerned that you don't have the right problem solving skills to deal with stressful situations which often occur within regulated activity. The DBS are satisfied that you failed to recognise the seriousness of the incident and the service user's potential injures despite your experience in care. The DBS are therefore satisfied that vulnerable adults placed in your care are in danger of being subjected to physical and emotional harm through your neglectful behaviour. </span></p>

The likelihood of you repeating your behaviour is therefore considered high, given you have already acted contrary to your training. The potential level of harm, if you repeated your behaviour, is significant and the DBS is satisfied your behaviour indicates the need to impose a preventative mechanism in order to protect vulnerable adults. </span></p>

	    <p class="Numbered" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">In respect of the first core finding (the failure to secure the commode/shower chair), SB accepts that on the balance of probabilities the commode/shower chair was not appropriately tilted or secured and that the service user&#8217;s care plan stated that it should be. However, it is argued that the DBS erred in failing to make any findings of fact as to the role and responsibility of SB&#8217;s co-worker that day (&#8220;HA&#8221;). It is said by SB that HA was the service user&#8217;s regular carer at the time of the incident and that HA&#8217;s own evidence was that she sometimes did not secure the service user&#8217;s chair.  SB argues that factual findings as to HA&#8217;s behaviour were plainly material to an assessment of SB&#8217;s responsibility and culpability. It is said by SB that the mistake of material fact here was the DBS&#8217;s failure to make findings of fact: per paragraph [39] of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">PF v DBS</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> [2020] UKUT 256 (AAC).    </span></p>

	    <p class="Numbered" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The second mistake of material fact ground of appeal is about the second core finding in the DBS&#8217;s decision, that SB had failed to seek medical assistance for the service user and had moved her without assessing her injuries.  SB argues the DBS here made a material error of fact in finding that the service user was &#8220;non-communicative&#8221; when it had previously (and SB says correctly) found the service user to be &#8220;non-verbal&#8221;. It is argued this was highly relevant because when the service user fell, she made no noise to indicate pain and, initially, showed no signs of injury, and SB therefore reasonably believed her uninjured and acted as she did (in moving the service user) on that basis. It is argued the DBS rejected this explanation as &#8220;not considered credible&#8221; on the erroneous basis that the service user &#8220;could not indicate her pain or injuries&#8221;. It is further argued that the statement that the service user&#8217;s injuries were not assessed is simply incorrect. It is submitted that SB (and HA) both initially believed that the service user was unharmed, they then assisted her to her bed where they performed an injury assessment.</span></p>

	    <p class="Numbered" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">In respect of the third core finding &#8211; that SB had failed to accurately record and report the incident &#8211; it is argued by SB that the DBS made a mistake of fact because she had been placed in an exceptionally difficult situation. Her colleague, HA, initially misled the service user&#8217;s daughter and another member of staff as to the cause of the service user&#8217;s injuries, but contradicting HA&#8217;s account would have meant SB undermining the trust developed in HA&#8217;s years&#8217; long care relationship with the service user, which SB was reluctant to do before having discussed the incident with her superiors. It is argued that, nonetheless, at no point following the incident, did the SB make any false or inaccurate statements regarding the service user&#8217;s fall. HA had stated she would phone the employer, Excelcare, to report the incident, and HA did so. It was for this reason that SB did not report the incident herself by phone. However, it is said, SB did provide an accurate report of the incident to Excelcare on leaving the service user&#8217;s home. It is further argued that the third core finding incorrectly apportions HA&#8217;s misconduct to SB. </span></p>

It is further argued that the DBS made a further error in failing to consider whether it was a realistic and reasonable approach in all the circumstances for patients to never to be touched and an ambulance called in any situation where there was a fall. SB argues here that so to act would have required her to leave the service user lying face down on the floor (in a position where her breathing would likely be impaired) for an indefinite period despite believing her to be uninjured. This prima, facie, would to be an irrational approach.</span></p>

SB argues that the DBS wrongly focused only on SB&#8217;s most recent representations to it and thus ignored other evidence of SB&#8217;s insight and remorse. This it is said is demonstrated by the fact that the DBS&#8217;s previous barring decision, of 29 March 2023, &#8220;acknowledged that [SB had] accepted responsibility for [her] behaviour and [had] apologised for it&#8221;. It is argued by SB under this ground in particular, and as a result, that the DBS was wrong to find (i) she had not accepted responsibility for her actions and had placed all the blame onto her colleague; (ii) that she had demonstrated an attitude that her behaviour was ok; and (iii) that she had focused only on the impact the incident had had on herself and her future aspirations.</span></p>

The DBS&#8217;s decision to bar SB it is argued was based on a single unfortunate accident which lasted less than an hour and where SB was not the service user&#8217;s regular carer, she generally cared for people with less advanced needs, and had not experienced a scenario such as the incident in issue before. It is argued in addition, inter alia, under this ground of appeal that (i) the DBS failed to consider the character references provided by SB, and (ii) that barring her, as an otherwise excellent carer, for a single incident for which she immediately took responsibility and into which she demonstrated insight, was wholly disproportionate.  </span></p>

HA had finished feeding VA and VA was then showered and dressed. They then put a sling on VA whilst she was sitting in the shower chair/commode. The sling was to aid transferring VA from the chair to the bed. HA would usually stand next to VA but on this occasion had moved from her side to make up VA&#8217;s bed. SB was standing a couple of feet away with her back to VA, putting some cream away. As SB turned around, she saw VA fall from the chair face down onto the floor. SB later told us that she did not know the chair had a tilted position, but it was (in her view) stable. It is common ground that the chair had not been secured in its tilted back position. SB initially told us that as neither she nor HA heard VA scream, they immediately lifted her back from the floor back onto the chair, and then checked VA over when she was in the chair.  VA was then transferred to bed.  SB then said that it was when VA was in the bed that she and HA &#8220;needed to see if she was okay or not on the head or the body&#8221;. This evidence was seemingly at variance with SB&#8217;s initial evidence that checks were made on VA when she was in the chair. In either event, SB&#8217;s evidence was that neither she nor HA had checked VA before moving her from the floor back to the chair.  </span></p>

However, HA told SB they were going to to tell the daughter her mother (VA) had hit her head in the hoist, which was part of the mechanism used to move VA in the sling. SB told us she had said to HA &#8220;How can you say this?&#8221;, but SB then froze. As HA in SB&#8217;s view had a good relationship with VA&#8217;s daughter, SB wanted to see if HA would lie to the daughter.  HA then suggested she and SB just left VA&#8217;s home, but SB&#8217;s evidence to us was that she told HA they could not do that and &#8220;no matter what we must tell the daughter the truth&#8221;. The daughter was in another room downstairs in VA&#8217;s house, and came into the room. The daughter was crying. When she asked what had happened, HA (wrongly) told the daughter her mother had hit her head on the hoist.

It was the third carer who ran to the kitchen to get an ice pack to put on VA&#8217;s bruised face.

She has reflected further on the incident and understands further what went wrong. She realises, she told us, that she ought not have picked VA up from the floor and should have reported what had occurred immediately.  She knows it was both her and HA&#8217;s responsibility to care for VA, but she thought HA would take the lead.  SB told us she had learnt from the incident and evidenced this by referring to a neighbour who had fallen and for whom she had called an ambulance and then waited until the ambulance arrived. She had become more cautious that nothing should go wrong when working as a teaching assistant.  Her dream job is to work with children but the barring decision had limited her career in this respect. SB said she deeply apologised for what had happened to VA. VA was like, and about the same age as, SB&#8217;s grandmother, and SB said she wanted to save VA otherwise the ambulance was going to come. She considered she had saved VA (by moving her from the floor) because VA&#8217;s face was down, she might not have been able to breathe and her condition could have worsened if she had been left lying face down on the floor. However, SB later accepted in cross-examination that they should not have moved VA after she had fallen to the floor and that they should have called the ambulance (and VA&#8217;s daughter) immediately. On the face of it, and consistently with what SB had told her employer on 10 and 11 August 2022, SB accepted that both the need to call the ambulance immediately and not to move VA arose from her (manual handling) training.  However, she had been shocked by the fall and as a result those steps were not taken.      </span></p>

Moreover, this was the only time she had not read a person&#8217;s care plan.  SB did not have VA&#8217;s care plan and had been told just to go to VA&#8217;s house and HA would tell her about VA&#8217;s care needs. She had asked HA about what exactly they had to do for VA, but HA had not given SB all the information and was quite bossy. In questions from the tribunal, SB told us that care plans for individuals were kept in their homes and on SB&#8217;s phone and &#8220;it was always suggested if going to a new home to read the care plan&#8221;. However, in this case SB had assumed HA would tell her what VA&#8217;s care needs were. SB&#8217;s evidence was that VA may have had a care plan in her home, but SB had not checked. Nor had she had &#8220;the opportunity&#8221; to say to HA that she (SB) needed to see the care plan, although this evidence was in our view somewhat undermined by SB&#8217;s later evidence that she had asked HA what VA&#8217;s care plan required, evidence which was itself somewhat undermined by earlier evidence of SB that she should have asked about the care plan. </span></p>

When Mr Ryan (for the DBS) put to SB that she had accepted in the interview with her manager on 10 August 2002 that she knew (from manual handling training) that she should never support someone up from the floor following a fall, particularly where they have hit their head, and she should have called for medical assistance, SB said she and HA had panicked. Once VA was back in the chair, HA had checked her for injuries, and once VA was in the bed both SB and HA had checked VA for injuries. In questioning from the tribunal, SB told us that she had had first aid training two years before the incident and was herself a first aid trainer.  SB accepted that when she saw the swelling on VA&#8217;s face she needed to tell the daughter so that the next steps to be taken could be identified. However, it had not come into SB&#8217;s mind that VA might have suffered a head injury as a result of the fall.      </span></p>

However, we consider this finding of fact was not properly open to the DBS on the evidence, and it was therefore mistaken. We have so concluded because in the absence of evidence as to the exact terms of the incident reporting procedure, we consider there was (and is) no secure basis for finding that SB, instead of or in addition to HA, was obliged by the incident reporting procedure to record the fall.  SB told us, which we have no reason to disbelieve on the evidence before us, that it was for HA as the more experienced care worker to report the incident, including the fall, and HA had done this when HA went to Excelcare&#8217;s office on 10 August 2022. Insofar as HA when so acting was acting on behalf of SB, there was no evidence before us, or the DBS when it made its decision, that HA did not record the fall via the incident reporting procedure.  </span></p>

Mr Ryan clarified later that the DBS was not, and had not, relied on SB herself having lied about VA having hit her head on the hoist. That clarification was welcome. There is nothing in the evidence before us to support any finding that SB had said VA had hit her head on the hoist. Moreover it should be noted that Excelcare in its letter of 17 August 2022 acknowledging SB&#8217;s resignation stated &#8220;[w]e appreciate your honesty in this matter&#8221;.  However, we should add that we did not see the relevance of whether SB and HA had (or had not) agreed to lie to the daughter about the fall.

It may be, as the DBS argued, that its earlier decision of 29 March 2023 had a more nuanced basis: because, having made the acknowledgement set out in paragraph 56 above, it continued &#8220;however your insight appears limited to the impact your behaviour has had on yourself and your career rather than the harmfulness of it&#8221;. Those concluding words may themselves have failed to take account of SB&#8217;s evidence in her 10 and 11 August 2022 interviews. However, the DBS&#8217;s acknowledgement quoted in paragraph 56 above is no more than demonstrative of the evidence from SB which supports her having accepted responsibility for her behaviour, and apologised for it, and it is that evidence of SB which the decision has not sufficiently taken into account. Nor are we persuaded by the DBS&#8217;s arguments about the quality or depth of the responsibility shown by SB.  That judgement had to be made having considered all the relevant evidence, which was not done in SB&#8217;s case.   </span></p>

We recognise that the assessment of risk is for the DBS. However, in making that assessment it had to take into account all relevant evidence. How SB viewed her role in what had occurred with VA on 10 August 2022 (including whether SB considered she had acted correctly in following and not correcting HA) in our judgment was plainly relevant to that assessment, and that required the DBS to consider all the relevant evidence going to those issues. </span></p>

SB argued in addition, or in the alternative, that the DBS made a mistaken factual finding that she had &#8220;not shown insight and remorse&#8221; for her actions on 10 August 2022. An initial concern we have here, which was not addressed in argument before us, is can it be said to be a finding of fact whether someone has &#8220;shown insight and remorse&#8221;. It is at least arguable that this &#8216;finding&#8217; is instead an evaluative conclusion based on all relevant evidence. The latter is off limits for the Upper Tribunal: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">SB</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> at paragraph [55]. Although the discussion in paragraph [55] of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">SB</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> is about the Upper Tribunal exercising the fact finding function located in section 4(7)(a) of the SVGA, it is also relevant in our judgement to deciding whether the DBS made a finding of fact about which it may have been mistaken.  The second concern we have is, ignoring the first concern, whether the DBS actually made a finding of fact in its decision that SB had not &#8220;shown insight and remorse&#8221;. None of the passages in the DBS&#8217;s decision on which SB relies (see paragraphs 54 and 55 above) make such a finding. The passage from the decision letter in paragraph 54 above does refer to SB having a lack of insight, but (i) that is in a more limited context of a need for SB to speak up, rather than her insight more generally, and (b) in any event, is tied to the DBS (legally wrong) view that the sole relevant evidence was that found in the additional representations.  It is therefore not a finding of fact (if it can be a finding of fact) that SB had not more generally &#8220;shown insight and remorse&#8221;. Given these concerns, we do not consider we can or should find on the evidence before us (including SB&#8217;s oral testimony which we have set out above) that the DBS made a mistaken finding of fact that SB had not shown &#8216;insight and remorse&#8217;.   </span></p>

Mr Ryan&#8217;s argument before us was that the DBS consideration of the character reference was sufficient. We do not agree. There is no consideration of the character references in the decision letter of 12 May 2023.  We accept that the decision letter has to be read alongside the record of DBS&#8217;s decision making process set out in the Barring Decision Summary document (the BDS&#8221;). Unlike the decision letter, the character references are noted and summarised in the BDS as it appears at pages 223 and 224 of the Upper Tribunal bundle.

SB (rightly) concedes that the said chair had not been appropriately secured on that day and that VA&#8217;s care plan stated that it should have been secured. The latter obligation being imposed by VA&#8217;s care plan was accepted by SB in her interview with her manager on 10 August 2022.  That admittance provides a sufficient evidential basis for the DBS&#8217;s finding that such a requirement was part of the safeguarding procedures Excelcare had in place for VA on 10 August 2022. Nor does SB argue that the DBS was wrong or mistaken in fact in finding that she, SB, failed to secure the chair.  The requirement to do so was in VA&#8217;s care plan which SB had not read but should have read (see our comment in paragraph 36 above), and her failure to read VA&#8217;s care plan formed part of her failure to follow safeguarding procedures and her consequent failure to secure the chair.  SB was co-caring for VA with HA that day and it was the responsibility of both of them to ensure that the chair was secured in the tilting position. Although SB referred to HA being a more senior carer, that was only in respect of HA having more experience as a carer including, particularly, for VA.  It was no part of SB&#8217;s case before us, and there was no evidence to this effect, that she was required to take a subservient role to HA or only do as HA told her.</span></p>

On the evidence, including the admissions of SB, the DBS was not mistaken in finding as a fact that SB had failed to follow safeguarding procures in that she (along with HA) had failed to secure/tilt the commode chair before VA used it.  Insofar as the DBS were required as part of a judgement as to relative culpability to consider HA and SB&#8217;s respective responsibilities and roles, in our judgement it did so sufficiently in its decision.</span></p>

Again, the content of the safeguarding procedures and requirements under which SB was working that day can be inferred from her admissions with her Excelcare manager on 10 August 2022. The material safeguarding rules, which SB accepted in the 10 August 2022 interview she knew about from training, including manual handling training, were (i) never to support someone up from the floor, particularly following a fall, and (ii) if someone had hit their head (as VA had), they should not be moved and medical assistance must be called for. On her own evidence, SB (with HA) moved VA from the floor without assessing HA&#8217;s injuries and had not called for medical assistance.  </span></p>

However, the core safeguarding faults were moving VA from the floor and not calling for medical assistance (i.e. an ambulance) while VA was on the floor. SB&#8217;s assessment of VA&#8217;s injuries was irrelevant in terms of those two safeguarding requirements, unless SB was being instructed to make such an assessment by a &#8216;999&#8217; operator whilst VA was on the floor, which she was not. </span></p>

Much was made on behalf of SB of the harm that might have been done to VA had she been left lying face down while waiting, perhaps for a long time, for the ambulance.  However, on the facts SB said she could see VA was conscious and breathing. Perhaps more importantly, what this argument leaves out of account is the role the &#8216;999&#8217; or ambulance service operator would have taken in enabling SB and HA to assess VA while waiting for the ambulance, and whilst VA remained on the floor, had they followed the safeguarding procedures and called an ambulance.  </span></p>

The arguments here for SB at times treated &#8216;disproportionate&#8217; as a synonym for &#8216;irrational&#8217;. That is a mistake. As case law such as the first sentence in paragraph [84] of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">In re B (Care Proceedings: Threshold Criteria)</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> [2013] UKSC 33; [2013] 1 WLR 1991 shows, properly understood, the argument that the DBS made a disproportionate decision is not an argument that the DBS erred in law in the procedure it adopted in coming to its decision that it was proportionate to place SB on both lists. The argument here is that the DBS erred in law on 12 May 2023 because the barring decision was disproportionate. We have to decide for ourselves whether the decision was disproportionate (see the same citation from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">In re B</span><span style="font-family:Arial">).

This has to be assessed in the context (i) of the appropriateness of barring not being a matter for us (see section 4(3) of the SVGA), and (ii) there being no less intrusive measures available: the DBS </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Arial">must</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> bar a person if the person has engaged in relevant conduct, the DBS has reason to believe they have engaged (or might in the future engage) in regulated activity with children/vulnerable adults, and the DBS is satisfied it is appropriate to include the person on the lists.  In other words, the question we have to decide is whether the decision to bar was a disproportionate interference with SB&#8217;s rights to work with vulnerable adults and children. </span></p>

The decision of the House of Lords in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">Huang v SSHD</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> [2007] UKHL 11; [2007] 2 AC 167 might suggest that it is for the Upper Tribunal to decide whether the barring decision was disproportionate having established the relevant facts: see paragraph [15] of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">Huang</span><span style="font-family:Arial">. However, it may be an important consideration that the fact finding arose in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">Huang</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> because the relevant statute enabled what is now the First-tier Tribunal, under section 65 and paragraphs 21(1) an (3) in Schedule 4 to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, to review any finding of  fact on which the decision was based when deciding whether the decision against the appeal was brought was not in accordance with the law. The error of law jurisdiction in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">Huang</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> therefore could include reviewing (and redeciding) issues of fact. Under section 4(2) and (7)(a) of the SVGA, however, it may be arguable that &#8216;facts&#8217; and &#8216;law&#8217; are kept separate from one another. Moreover, the case law on proportionality is clear that the Upper Tribunal is not carrying out a full merits reconsideration (see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">B v ISA</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> [2012] EWCA Civ 977; [2013] 1 WLR 124 at paragraphs [14] and [19]) and the Upper Tribunal must give appropriate weight to the DBS&#8217;s decision on proportionality (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">B v ISA</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> at [21]), which arguably must be the DBS&#8217;s decision based on the facts as it found them. Given these features of the legal landscape, it may not be open to the Upper Tribunal to base the search for an error of law based on whether the decision was a disproportionate breach of the barred person&#8217;s human rights on what the Upper Tribunal has decided are the &#8216;correct&#8217; facts.

That risk of SB harming other vulnerable adults and children, giving appropriate weight to the DBS&#8217;s view about the same, in our judgement is properly and particularly based on SB&#8217;s reaction to VA&#8217;s fall. What happened on 10 August 2022 may have been a one-off event but that is because, on her own evidence, it is something that SB had not encountered before. This is not an issue that was explored in any detail before us (see further what we say in paragraph 74 above).  However, our judgement on the evidence which was before us is that, notwithstanding her 6 years of care work and her training, SB did not insist on reading VA&#8217;s care plan and then panicked/froze when VA fell. As a result, she did not follow that which she later accepted she knew should be done and wrongly moved VA from the floor despite knowing VA had hit her head on the floor. So acting could have had very serious consequences for VA, as moving her head and neck in an unsecure way could have exacerbated any head or brain injury. Given the risk to others evidenced by SB&#8217;s acting outwith the safeguarding rules she knew about and was expected to work under, the likely benefit to the community as a whole of barring SB from working with vulnerable adults and children did not, in our judgement, amount to a disproportionate interference with SB&#8217;s Article 8 human rights.  </span></p>
