This finding failed to take account of the fact that he was the sole or main alleged perpetrator of the discrimination and/or his consequent availability as a witness for the Respondent and the effect of the delay upon the quality of any evidence that he could give.  Alternatively, this finding was perverse.</p>

He named potential witnesses as Richard Pitt, Arthur O&#8217;Donnell, Louis Markov and Conway Crosson. The latter was a member of the HR team.</p>

In her judgment sent on 21 September 2023, she held that the claims of direct discrimination were presented after expiry of the time limit in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/123/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 123(1)</ref>(a) but that it was just and equitable to extend time under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/123/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 123(1)</ref>(b).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The procedural history then becomes a little unusual.  Tribunal Judge Iqbal decided to reconsider the Judgment of her own motion. It appears that this was because she had omitted to record part of her Judgment given orally at the hearing. In her written reasons, sent to the parties on 13 February 2024, she cited a number of authorities relevant to strike out applications.  When addressing the jurisdictional time point, she cited <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/123" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 123</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref> but did not refer to any of the well-known authorities on extension of time and the correct approach for a Tribunal considering whether it is just and equitable to extend time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">At the Preliminary Hearing, the Respondent submitted that any act or omission occurring prior to 1 September 2021 was presented out of time.  The last possible date for any act of age discrimination was in the two weeks after the Claimant returned to work in July 2020, during which period Mr Brown was his line manager.  In other words, the claim was at least 14 months out of time. The Respondent submitted that it would be prejudiced if time were extended because the Claimant relied upon undocumented verbal comments by Mr Brown who had left the Respondent&#8217;s employ in November 2020.</p>

	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In his submissions, the Claimant asserted that the alleged acts of age discrimination happened during the period from January 2019 to December 2019.  His explanation for not acting sooner was that he was trying to return to work.  The Claimant appears to have relied upon ill-health more generally but it is not entirely clear from the reasons what this ill-health was nor how it affected his ability to present a claim sooner.  The Claimant accepted that a number of the acts relied upon as age discrimination were verbal comments not supported by any documentary evidence and which would need to be tested in oral evidence.</p>

I find I am satisfied, according the Claimant with the benefit of doubt that given the timeline of the Claimant&#8217;s time of work due to (his claimed) ill-health and the period in which he returned to work and eventually resigned may have caused him to delay bringing such a claim. In any case he had in his ET1 ticked age discrimination as a claim but simply not articulated. When I consider this against the fact he has clearly identified Liam Brown who was responsible for the incidents and the fact that there appear to be other individuals such as Conway Crosson who remain employed with the Defendant (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt">sic</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt">), who advised the Claimant on matters he complains of as discriminatory, then there is no prejudice to the Respondent, simply because Liam Brown has left the company.

Whilst there is a reference to acts occurring after expiry of the time limit which could be conduct extending over a period, there is then no finding that there was any such conduct. On this basis, the last date of any alleged discrimination was January 2019.</p>

Another factor was that the Claimant had brought his age discrimination claim by ticking the box on the ET1 and, when he provided the further information, he clearly identified Liam Brown.  The Tribunal found that because there were other current employees of the Respondent who advised the Claimant, there was no prejudice to the Respondent by reason of Mr Brown being no longer employed as other employees, such as Mr Crosson remained employed.  For these reasons, she decided that it was just and equitable to extend time. </p>

When tribunals consider their discretion to consider a claim out of time on just and equitable grounds there is no presumption that they should do so unless they can justify failure to exercise the discretion. Quite the reverse. A tribunal cannot hear a complaint unless the applicant convinces it that it is just and equitable to extend time. So, the exercise of discretion is the exception rather than the rule. It is of a piece with those general propositions that an Appeal Tribunal may not allow an appeal against a Tribunal's refusal to consider an application out of time in the exercise of its discretion merely because the Appeal Tribunal, if it were deciding the issue at first instance, would have formed a different view. As I have already indicated, such an appeal should only succeed where the Appeal Tribunal can identify an error of law or principle, making the decision of the Tribunal below plainly wrong in this respect.</span>&#8221;</p>

The Tribunal failed properly to balance the prejudice between the parties.  The relevant facts were that the Respondent had no prior warning of the complaints until the provision of the further information in 2022.  There was no contemporaneous documentary evidence. The only other participant in the verbal exchanges relied upon had left the Respondent&#8217;s in November 2020.  Mr Crosson could only give hearsay evidence years after the event and was also no longer employed.  Had it taken all of those matters into account the Tribunal, properly directing itself, would have reached the conclusion that it was not just and equitable to extend time. The decision to extend time was perverse as no reasonable Tribunal, properly directing itself on the law and applying it to the facts, could have decided that it was just and equitable to do so.  </p>
