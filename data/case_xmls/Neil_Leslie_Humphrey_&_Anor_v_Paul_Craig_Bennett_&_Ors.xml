This was about the proposed Ansty Road Project but the outcome of the discussions at that meeting and subsequently are at the heart of the present dispute. The Claimants say that additional investment should not have been necessary and continued to expect that the Company would acquire the Ansty Road Land and carry out the Ansty Road Project. According to the Defendants, Mr Bennett and Ms Murphy got the opposite impression, namely that the Claimants informed them that they did not wish to be involved in the Ansty Road Project. </p>

It is accepted that the proposed new causes of action must have a real prospect of success to be allowed to go forward. In some cases that may require an applicant to adduce evidence to show that factual averments have a credible basis. In this case however, the Claimants are essentially  using the existing facts pleaded in their current Re-Amended Particulars of Claim as the basis for their new causes of action. In those circumstances, it seems to me that it  is appropriate to accept that those facts are in play at the trial and the only question on this application is whether the new causes of action are adequately pleaded and have legal coherence. (The Defendants have not sought any further information in relation to the proposed amendments, probably because their case is that they are not sustainable as a matter of law.)</span></p>

That would therefore involve the question as to whether a person acting in accordance with their director&#8217;s duties under s.172 CA 2006 would seek to continue such a claim. If they would not, permission </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">must</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> be refused: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46/section/263/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 263(2)</ref>(a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 2006</ref>.

Mr Bennett and Ms Murphy effectively transferred the Ansty Road Project from the Company to their own company EHCL, thus depriving the Company of the opportunity of pursuing the Ansty Road Project. That is hotly disputed on the facts but it seems to me that it is properly arguable that, on those facts, EHCL has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the Company, which has lost the possibility of making profits from exploiting the Ansty Road Project. If there are matters that the Defendants are unclear about, they can ask for further information.</span></p>

The former is a little difficult to understand as most of the development has been sold on to third parties and there can presumably be no question of the land itself being restored to the Company. As to the latter, EHCL will certainly be able to plead change of position by way of its Defence, but this will no doubt be met in due course by the Claimants&#8217; Reply containing their answer to this defence. It is clearly premature to determine anything in relation to that defence and it cannot be said that the Claimants have no real prospect of successfully overcoming such a defence.   </span></p>

Particulars of EHCL&#8217;s alleged dishonesty are given in paragraph 26B(iii). This includes that Mr Bennett and Ms Murphy&#8217;s knowledge, which is attributable to EHCL, was that: (a) the Claimants had not consented to the transfer of the Wyken Grange Land; (b) that transfer was for below market value; (c) the transfer was not in the Company&#8217;s interests; and (d) the transfer was in their own interests (as shareholders of EHCL).

However, as I said above, the Claimants do refer to the exploitation of the Ansty Road Project opportunity that they allege was owned by the Company &#8211; see paragraphs 11 and 26B(iii)(g) of the draft Re-Re-Amended Particulars of Claim. While, as I said during the hearing, this is a crisp pleading of dishonesty, in my view it is adequate at this stage as a matter of law and particularisation to be allowed. </span></p>

He said that the remedy for dishonest assistance is not a proprietary remedy or for any sort of constructive trust. I think this is accepted but I am not sure what he was driving at. If the Claimants succeed on this claim they may be entitled to an account of profits made by EHCL arising from its dishonest assistance or they could receive equitable compensation. I do not think that the Claimants are claiming a proprietary remedy. </span></p>

	    <p class="CourtOneL1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However I think it is at least arguable that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46/section/260/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.260(3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 2006</ref> should be construed broadly. Indeed it specifically covers not only breaches of duty, but also any default by the directors. In failing to cause the Company to obtain the members&#8217; prior consent to the transaction, the directors involved in the transaction with a potential conflict in benefitting themselves at the expense of the Company are likely to be in breach of their duties or in default in putting the Company in breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46/section/190" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.190</ref> CA 2006. It also seems to me that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46/section/195/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.195(3)</ref> CA 2006 contemplates the Company, or its liquidator or administrator, as the only claimant for such an account or indemnity. Where the allegedly wrongdoing Defendants are the majority of the members of the Company, such a claim can only be brought by way of derivative action, or possibly by way of an unfair prejudice petition under s.994 CA 2006. Furthermore, sub<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46/section/195/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 195(5)</ref>-(7) CA 2006 make liability on the directors fault-based, thus indicating that there has to have been some default or breach within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46/section/260/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.260(3)</ref> CA 2006.</p>

	    <p class="CourtOneL1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Reed&#8217;s second point was that the transaction had been affirmed by purported resolutions passed on 8 January 2025. There was a meeting on that day at which the Claimants were represented by their solicitor, Mr Michael Baxendale, who held a proxy for each of them. The first two resolutions were for the removal of the Claimants as directors of the Company. The fourth resolution was to approve the transfer by the Company of the Wyken Grange Land to EHCL that had taken place 5 years earlier on 23 January 2020. I queried whether these resolutions had even been validly passed as the voting was recorded to be on a show of hands, not a poll. Arguably there would then have been an equality of votes, 2 for and 2 against, and so no majority in favour of the resolution.</p>
