Allegations of wrongdoing go before a tribunal of the Medical Practice Tribunal Service (<span style="font-weight:bold">the MPTS</span>; <span style="font-weight:bold">the tribunal</span>).

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The tribunal decided on 29 August 2024 to uphold in part certain allegations of misconduct, including sexual misconduct, against Mr Shah; and to suspend him from medical practice for 12 months, with a review at the end of that period.  The GMC regards that sanction as insufficient for the protection of the public and appeals under section 40A of the Medical Act 1983 against the decision to impose that sanction.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The GMC does not challenge the tribunal&#8217;s findings of fact but asserts that the tribunal made errors of principle and in its analysis of the evidence when addressing the issue of &#8220;impairment&#8221;, i.e. whether Mr Shah&#8217;s fitness to practise is impaired by reason of misconduct; and at the &#8220;sanction&#8221; stage, i.e. in determining that the appropriate sanction was suspension for 12 months with a review at the end of the suspension period.</p>

The GMC invites me to substitute that sanction for the 12 month suspension imposed by the tribunal.  Alternatively, the GMC invites me to set aside the tribunal&#8217;s determination and remit the matter to a tribunal of the MPTS with appropriate directions.</p>

He has developing insight into his conduct.  The tribunal&#8217;s analysis was sound; it was entitled to find no risk of repetition of the misconduct.  The tribunal rightly observed, Mr Shah submitted, that there is a spectrum of seriousness for sexual misconduct and that erasure is not automatic in sexual misconduct cases.  The sanction of suspension includes a review at the end of the period of suspension.</p>

He was questioned by police but no criminal proceedings were brought.  The matter was investigated by the GMC.  It brought disciplinary charges against him.  A disciplinary hearing was convened.  The hearing before the tribunal lasted from 12 to 29 August 2024.  Both sides were represented by counsel.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The allegations covered the period from 2005 and 2021 when Mr Shah was working as consultant thoracic surgeon at Wythenshawe Hospital. He was charged with behaving inappropriately towards female &#8220;Colleague A&#8221; and &#8220;Colleague B&#8221;.  His conduct towards them was said to be sexual harassment and sexually motivated.  He was also charged with asking or allowing Colleague A and &#8220;Colleague C&#8221;, a medical secretary called Ms Kirsty Larkin, to complete elements of his mandatory training [2]-[8]<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first group of allegations concerned Colleague A, a medical secretary.  The detailed allegations were of treating her in a derogatory manner from 2005 to 2012, including tapping her cheeks when asking her to do something; clicking his fingers to gain her attention; calling her a &#8220;good girl&#8221;; and calling one or more other female colleagues &#8220;bird&#8221; (not to their face, but to Colleague A).  Mr Shah denied all those matters, except that he admitted to calling Colleague A a &#8220;good girl&#8221; and using the word &#8220;bird&#8221; to her.</p>

	    <num>9.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He was also charged with inappropriate touching of Colleague A without her consent, between 2011 and 2021, including, at the most serious, putting his hands up her skirt, touching her genitals over her underwear, rubbing his penis up and down her legs, attempting to touch her legs, thighs and breasts and masturbating within his trousers in her presence.  Mr Shah denied those charges, asserting in his defence that the sexual touching was consensual.</p>

	    <num>10.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All those matters were said to amount to sexual harassment within the meaning of section 26 of the Equality Act 2010.  Mr Shah admitted that the conduct alleged in the charges he denied, had occurred, but did not accept that it was without Colleague A&#8217;s consent.  He therefore admitted, unusually, that his conduct was &#8220;sexually motivated&#8221; but not that it constituted sexual harassment because it was not unwanted.  Colleague A&#8217;s credibility and that of Mr Shah were therefore central to this group of allegations.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The next two allegations concerned Colleague B, a recovery nurse.  It was alleged that on 11 October 2014, he put his arm round her, steered her towards and into a coffee room, then leaned into her to hug her and squeezed both cheeks of her bottom.  It was further alleged that nearly five years later, on 2 October 2019, he brushed his body against her breasts, put both arms round her, put his left arm on her right hip and right buttock and squeezed her right buttock.  This was alleged to be sexual harassment as defined in section 26 of the Equality Act 2010.  Mr Shah denied these charges.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, all the conduct alleged was said to be &#8220;an abuse of your professional position&#8221; in that Mr Shah was in a more senior position than the three female colleagues; and Colleagues A and B felt unable to prevent, challenge or report his actions [7].</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The tribunal recorded ([11]-[14]) that it received written, oral and documentary evidence.  The GMC&#8217;s witnesses were Colleagues A and B; Ms Larkin; Ms Claire Stepsys, a medical secretary; and Mr Richard Montague, a consultant urologist.  Mr Shah&#8217;s witnesses were himself; Professor Richard Booton, a consultant respiratory physician who was Mr Shah&#8217;s clinical director; and Mr Mark Jones, a consultant thoracic surgeon.  Mr Shah also relied on written testimonials from others.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The tribunal directed itself about how to approach the evidence, partly by analogy with principles applicable in criminal proceedings and discrimination claims [25]-[35].  This aspect of the decision is not controversial and was not criticised in the grounds of appeal.  The tribunal then went on at [36]-[79] to state its analysis of the evidence and its findings of fact.  The results were mixed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to Colleague A, Mr Shah said consensual incidental touching evolved into consensual sexual touching over years.  Colleague A said the touching was non-consensual and that she made this clear to Mr Shah.  She denied doing any of his mandatory training for him, while he admitted that allegation.  She said he was disrespectful to her.  He had referred to as &#8220;bird&#8221; a female colleague whose name Colleague A said she could not recall.</p>

	    <num>17.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The tribunal discussed the unusual nature of this conflict of evidence.  They concluded that on the balance of probabilities, the allegations about Colleague A were only proved to the extent that Mr Shah admitted his conduct towards Colleague A, i.e. that he had called her a &#8220;good girl&#8221; and referred to another female colleague as &#8220;bird&#8221;.  The tribunal noted Mr Shah&#8217;s admissions and the contrition he expressed about those admitted matters.  Having regard to the imbalance of power, they had the effect of creating a demeaning and intimidating, humiliating or offensive environment for Colleague A.</p>

	    <num>18.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no challenge in this appeal to the findings of fact about Colleague A and the rejection by the tribunal of her evidence except where it was admitted by Mr Shah.  The sexual touching had occurred, the tribunal found, and was (as Mr Shah admitted and asserted) sexually motivated, but the GMC had not proved that it was unwanted and it was therefore not sexual harassment.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As for Colleague B, the tribunal accepted that the two incidents of sexual misconduct, in October 2014 and October 2019, had occurred.  After the first incident, she had emailed her manager to place it on record, though not taking it further at the time.  She did report the second incident and made a formal complaint.  She then received what the tribunal called a &#8220;qualified letter of apology&#8221; for (in Mr Shah&#8217;s words in the letter) &#8220;making you feel uncomfortable&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">His evidence was that he is tactile by nature; there may have been social touching but it was not inappropriate and he did not touch her buttocks.  He knew nothing of the complaint dating from 2014 until five years later.  However, the tribunal accepted that the incidents had occurred and that Colleague B had found it difficult to confront Mr Shah about them.  In his letter of apology in October 2019 Mr Shah had also said:</p>

The Tribunal therefore decided that a sanction of suspension would uphold the overarching objective in the circumstances of this case. The Tribunal was satisfied that a period of suspension would maintain public confidence and uphold professional standards and conduct. The Tribunal did consider that it was in the public interest to retain a valuable doctor on the register, but this was not a significant factor in its determination. The Tribunal accepted the submission of the GMC, as did Mr Brassington on behalf of the Doctor, that &#8216;being an excellent surgeon cannot mitigate sexually inappropriate conduct to junior colleagues&#8217;.</span></p>

The example of Colleague B may test this: supposing that Mr Shah had harassed her by unwanted sexual touching ten times in five years rather than twice in five years.  His sexual harassment of her would have been more serious than it was.  It is obvious that sexual harassment may vary: from annoying unwanted verbal sexual innuendo at one end of the spectrum to serious sexual assault at the other.</p>

I note the observation that Mr Shah&#8217;s use of language towards Colleague A was harassment under section 26(1) of the Equality Act 2010.  The tribunal then said at [117] that it &#8220;did not accept that to make this finding meant that it was bound to find serious misconduct&#8221;.  That was not a misdirection of law and I did not understand the GMC to contend that it was.</p>

Breaches of section 26 were included in the charges against Mr Shah.  Ms Emsley-Smith properly referred the tribunal [139] to paragraph 138(b) of the Sanctions Guidance, which states that &#8220;[m]ore serious outcomes are likely to be appropriate if there are serious findings that involve &#8230; sexual harassment &#8230; [or] unlawful discrimination (see paragraphs 139-141)&#8221;.</p>

That is not controversial.  But one must be careful not to overstate the relevance of the 2010 Act.  It is not a trump card leading to an automatic finding of serious misconduct, still less automatic erasure.</p>

The conduct of a doctor in a particular case could be just as much deplorable sexual harassment if the causes of action in tort had never been enacted.  The fact that a legal label fits the doctor&#8217;s conduct does not change what the doctor did and did not do.  Many wrongs in our society contravene more than one law.  The appetite for adding to the list of legal labels to describe wrongs is very strong but it is still the same conduct being judged.</p>

The doctor&#8217;s conduct is judged according to the regime laid down in the Medical Act 1983, the relevant Fitness to Practise Rules (which were not in the authorities bundle) and the Sanctions Guidance.</p>

The tribunal&#8217;s analysis was detailed and careful.  Its decisions were &#8220;multifactorial&#8221;, as Mr Brassington put it.

The GMC has not sought to criticise the tribunal&#8217;s directions.  At [174] they commented, perfectly reasonably said Mr Brassington, that there would not be evidence of &#8220;full remediation and insight so soon after Dr Shah had maintained his denial of the offending behaviour&#8221;.

The words were used in testimonials saying what an excellent doctor Mr Shah is.  Furthermore, the testimonials included statements from female colleagues saying they felt comfortable in Mr Shah&#8217;s presence and that he behaved professionally towards them.

The GMC therefore cannot say the point was overlooked.  It was, indeed, treated as an aggravating factor at the sanction stage.

The tribunal recorded Ms Emsley-Smith&#8217;s submission at  [140.1] that the testimonials predated the adverse findings and was not bound to address in terms &#8220;this satellite issue&#8221;, as Mr Brassington characterised it.</p>

It was relevant context that the tribunal had noted at [169] the guidance at paragraph 97(g) of the Sanctions Guidance that suspension may be appropriate where &#8220;the doctor has insight and does not pose a significant risk of repeating behaviour&#8221;.

He would be expected to produce evidence about this at the review stage, as the tribunal noted ([178]-[179]) and &#8220;the onus will be on Dr Shah to demonstrate how he has remediated and developed full insight into his misconduct&#8221;.

Thus, Mr Brassington submitted below (as recorded at [103]), that Mr Shah &#8220;accepts there will be a finding of current impairment in respect of his conduct relating to Colleague B, and is aware of the impact this will have on what would otherwise have been an exemplary career and legacy.&#8221;</p>

The tribunal was right not to expect a Damascene overnight revelation of full insight the day after the findings of fact.  Ms Grey did not explain what was wrong with the way the tribunal addressed that issue.  To describe the doctor&#8217;s insight as developing and subject to examination at the review stage was not wrong or unfair on anyone.</p>

An absence of risk of repetition does not have to be driven wholly by remorse, shame or self-loathing about past conduct; just as offenders leaving prison may think twice about reoffending not just out of sympathy for their possible future victims.</p>

There is no point in reflective statements if they cannot, at least sometimes, be accepted at face value.  If they are to be rejected as insincere (or even used <span style="font-style:italic">against</span> a person as in <span style="font-style:italic">Lusinga v.

Accordingly, I reject the second and fourth grounds of appeal.</p>

The only words of substance missing from the tribunal&#8217;s consideration of paragraph 109 of the Sanctions Guidance are, as the GMC would have it, the adjectives &#8220;deliberate or reckless&#8221; to describe the quality of the doctor&#8217;s &#8220;disregard&#8221; of principles of GMP.  This omission may have been because the tribunal overlooked 109(b) or it may have been because it did not consider that (b) applied on the facts.</p>

It is the disregard of GMP that must be deliberate or reckless, not the misconduct.  The tribunal analysed Mr Shah&#8217;s conduct carefully and in detail in its decision.  If it was the former, which I think unlikely since the tribunal had paragraph 109 well in mind, I accept the submission of Mr Brassington that the omission would not have made any difference to the analysis or the conclusion and does not vitiate the decision to suspend not erase.</p>

There, a GP had entered into a sexual relationship with a patient over two years and nine months, while continuing to act as her GP; the patient had suffered from depression and tried to take her own life.  The tribunal found dishonesty as well, when the matter came to light.  It is not surprising that the judge found a 12 month suspension inadequate to protect the public and maintain confidence in the profession.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Bramhall</span>, these were that the doctor had taken advantage of vulnerable patients and abused his power and their trust in him.  The determination appealed against did not address these indicators.  There was &#8220;an important part of the picture missing&#8221; (see the judgment at [35]-[36]).</p>

I do not think &#8220;reckless disregard&#8221; of GMP fits well with the tribunal&#8217;s assessment of Mr Shah&#8217;s conduct.  In relation to Colleague A, the misconduct was not found to be serious, albeit it was sexual harassment.  In relation to Colleague B, the misconduct was serious but there were two episodes five years apart.  I cannot view this case, as the GMC does, as one where there is a gap in the tribunal&#8217;s reasoning and an unexplained departure from an authoritative steer in the Sanctions Guidance.</p>

However, difficulty in remediating is, as Ms Grey accepts, considered in the next paragraph of the tribunal&#8217;s decision [173] where the conclusion is that &#8220;the conduct was potentially remediable, and &#8230; it had evidence that Dr Shah had commenced that remediation&#8221;.</p>

The reasoning of the tribunal is adequate and (echoing Morris J&#8217;s words in <span style="font-style:italic">Byrne v.
