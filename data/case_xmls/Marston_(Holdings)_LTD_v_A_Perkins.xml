      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Indirect sex discrimination &#8211; section 19 Equality Act 2010</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Unfair dismissal &#8211; reason for dismissal &#8211; redundancy &#8211; section 98 Employment Rights Act 1996</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000">The claimant had complained of indirect sex discrimination arising out of a provision, criterion or practice (&#8220;PCP&#8221;) that she travel significant distances, which put her at a disadvantage due to her childcare responsibilities.  She had also complained of unfair dismissal.  The Employment Tribunal (&#8220;ET&#8221;) had upheld both claims.  The respondent appealed. </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Held:</span><span style="color:#000000"> allowing the appeal</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000">Indirect sex discrimination</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000">It was unclear from the reasons provided whether the ET had approached the question of group disadvantage on the basis that the childcare disparity meant this was intrinsic in the PCP or simply an obvious consequence of it.  It had also failed to properly engage with the application of the PCP as a general rule, rather than in terms of its particular application to the claimant. </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000">Unfair dismissal</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000">Although the ET had appeared to accept that the claimant had previously accepted that she had been dismissed by reason of redundancy, it considered she should not be bound by that earlier statement of her position, going on to find that she had not been made redundant and that the respondent had failed to demonstrate a fair reason for the claimant&#8217;s dismissal, which was thus unfair.  The respondent had, however, understood that redundancy, as the reason for dismissal, was not in dispute and it was unfair for the ET to adopt the course that it did without first permitting the parties to address this issue.  Moreover, the ET&#8217;s reasoning did not properly engage with the ways in which the respondent had put (or would have put) its case, such that it could not properly understand why it had lost. </span></p>

This is the full hearing of the respondent&#8217;s appeal against the judgment of the ET sitting at Liverpool (Employment Judge Ainscough sitting with Mr P Dodd and Mrs J Pennie over three days in August and October 2023, with a further two days of deliberations in chambers in October and November 2023), sent out to the parties on 16 January 2024, upholding the claimant&#8217;s claims of indirect sex discrimination and unfair dismissal.  The respondent appeals against that judgment on seven grounds, falling under the following headings: (1) indirect sex discrimination: disadvantage (grounds 1-4); (2) indirect sex discrimination: justification (ground 5); (3) unfair dismissal: reason for dismissal (grounds 6 and 7).</span></p>

The claimant&#8217;s continuous employment started in 2005, albeit her contract was dated 2009; she was employed by the respondent as Head of Enforcement, Local Taxation, and her contract recorded that her place of work was Helmshore.  As Head of Enforcement (a grade 3 manager role within the respondent), the claimant was responsible for the management of the administrative team and for field agents; as the ET found, there was no contractual requirement for her to travel within her role. At the relevant time, the claimant had primary caring responsibility for her two children, both under five.  </span></p>

On 27 July 2021, the claimant&#8217;s then line manager (Ms Alessi) advised that it was the respondent&#8217;s intention to create one enforcement services centre, based in Helmshore, to be managed by the claimant as </span>Head of Enforcement Services/Head of Enforcement Services Centre; <span style="color:#000000">the management of the field based enforcement agents would be transferred elsewhere, but enforcement work from Darlington, Epping and Birmingham would transfer to Helmshore and the claimant would be responsible for a bigger administrative team.  The ET found that the claimant experienced no reduction in her work as a result of this re-structure, although there was a change to the tasks she was required to undertake.</span></p>

In September, October and November 2021, the claimant declined to attend face-to-face team meetings in (respectively) Epping, Birmingham, and Daventry, explaining that this was due to her childcare responsibilities; on each occasion, Mr Burton accepted she could attend the meetings remotely, by Teams.  On 18 August 2021, the claimant asked Mr Burton for clarification of her new job title and job description; ultimately, in October 2021, she was advised to create her own job description, which she sent to Mr Burton on 1 November 2021. </span></p>

In early February, the claimant responded, saying that if her role required travel it was no longer suitable for her, confirming that, although she could travel reasonable distances, she had to be able to return in time for childcare.  On 23 February 2022, Mr Burton added the phrase &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">travel as when required</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221; to the respondent&#8217;s job description for a grade 3 manager.  On 3 March 2022, he told the claimant that, if she did not comply with the travel requirement, this could lead to disciplinary action. </span></p>

Mr Burton responded on 24 March 2022, saying she had already informally agreed to the new role; as the ET found, it was Mr </span>Burton&#8217;s view that the work the claimant had carried out over the last ten months was in transition to the position now clarified following the restructure.  He informed the claimant that the confirmed position was that enforcement services would be transferred to Helmshore as previously advised, but the Epping office would remain open longer than anticipated.  Recording the claimant&#8217;s position as being that she was unable to travel due to childcare, Mr Burton said there was a need to travel to link in with other services and other operational managers (the ET found this rationale differed to the requirement to travel to manage the staff in Epping), and she was officially put on notice of a potential redundancy situation. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 25 March 2022 the claimant responded, saying she was unable to travel and therefore unable to perform the role.  In a letter that day, inviting the claimant to a consultation meeting, the respondent&#8217;s position was stated to be that travel could be limited to one day per month; if this was not acceptable, however, the change would be enforced and could lead to the termination of the claimant&#8217;s employment by reason of redundancy.   On 28 March 2022, Mr Burton clarified that the options for the claimant were either enforcement of the respondent&#8217;s changes, fire and re-hire under a new contract, or redundancy. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 2 April 2022, the claimant attended the first consultation meeting with Mr Burton and a member of HR; she confirmed that if her employment was to be terminated, she would rather proceed down the redundancy route.  Mr Burton advised that, because of her position and seniority, there was an expectation that the claimant would travel; it was said this was the culture within the respondent&#8217;s business and that travel would break down barriers, whereas a failure to travel could impact on future acquisitions. </p>

At the meeting on 25 April 2022, however, Mr Burton was unable to give specific examples of barriers created by the claimant's lack of travel, albeit he reiterated it was the company&#8217;s culture to travel to meetings.  The conclusion of that meeting was that a role existed, but with travel. No alternative roles were identified.</p>

Despite repeated attempts by myself to be provided with a new job description, no formal process was undertaken at that time or in subsequent months ... I was informally advised of an alternative suitable role, which I agreed to on the basis it was expressed to me.  It was not until March 2022, 8 months after I had taken on significant additional workload to enable my transition in to this new role, that the goal posts were moved to include an element of significant travel (to London and Epping which are a 9 hour-plus round trip for me).  Furthermore when I had raised my limitations regarding travel over the course of the 8 months, I was told that it was not a problem and could continue to meet via MS Teams as was done throughout the business.  As I was unable to fulfil this new requirement (which I believe was a disingenuous requirement), due to childcare limitations, a formal consultation process was undertaken which resulted in my redundancy.  Had a formal consultation taken place at the point my role of Head of Enforcement Local Taxation was identified for redundancy, my opportunities might have been different. </span></p>

I therefore maintain that there was a reasonable alternative role which I was the most suitable candidate to undertake.  I believe the reason this was rejected was because the structure had been pre-determined, which did not involve me in the position ... Therefore, the discussions around travel were disingenuous as this requirement was added as a way to ensure I could not accept the alternative role, and it could therefore be successfully given to the pre-determined individual.&#8221;</span></p>

I informed them that if my circumstances permitted, I would attend any face to face meeting, but as I hold the burden of childcare for my two young children, I could not commit to a carte blanche statement.  Their inconsistencies in correspondence, and unwillingness to provide any solid clarification in verbal discussions, created a situation where there was no option for me.  The travel locations included London and Epping, which would have involved a 9-hour plus round trip from my home address which they were unwilling to take into consideration.  I therefore believe I have been the subject of indirect sex discrimination as a mother and a female.  I evidenced to them that adjustments could be made, and in fact in the appeal hearing, it was confirmed that feedback regarding my performance from across the business was &#8220;amazing&#8221;, despite the vast majority of communication held with colleagues remotely.  Therefore, the role could have continued to be done with meetings held over MS Teams when required, as is done extensively throughout the business on a daily basis, and I could have continued in the alternative role of Head of Enforcement Services, as offered to me in July 2021.&#8221;</span></p>

In this regard, the respondent submitted that requiring the claimant to travel significant distances in her new role was a reasonable alternative, particularly as it had sought to minimise this and to help arrange travel in line with her childcare.

Acknowledging that the ET could take judicial note of the fact that women were primary carers of children, the respondent argued this was insufficient to prove group disadvantage, observing that there was no statistical or actual evidence that others were unable to comply with the requirement to travel significant distances; further, there needed to be evidence that this disadvantage was caused to the claimant.  In any event, the respondent contended that this was a proportionate means of achieving its legitimate aims of improving business efficacy and staff morale, relying in this regard on the evidence of Mr Burton, who had spoken of why in-person meetings were considered necessary in the respondent&#8217;s business in helping to &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#010302">break down barriers and cement relationships</span><span style="color:#010302">&#8221;, in particular in coming out of the pandemic and where flexibility was needed &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#010302">with new acquisitions, to properly transition knowledge</span><span style="color:#010302">&#8221;. </span></p>

In this regard, the ET noted that Mr Burton had been unable to provide details of any suggested barriers at the second consultation meeting and there was no evidence that the claimant had been unable to manage the team or that her performance had been hindered as a result of not travelling in the previous ten months.  The ET concluded: </p>

We are sympathetic to the notion that if a party seeks to rely upon a matter in respect of which judicial notice is to be taken, then it should identify that matter up front. There are several reasons for taking that approach: a. First, it seems to us to be consistent with the principle, which was not disputed, that the burden in terms of establishing that a matter is capable of being judicially noticed lies with the party seeking to rely upon it.  b. Second, it is preferable that all parties and the Tribunal are aware of precisely what it is that should be judicially noticed. Whilst the childcare disparity is uncontroversial and accepted by the Respondent, other related matters are not. For example, it is not accepted that the childcare disparity necessarily means that&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt;color:#000000">any</span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">&#160;requirement to work flexibly will put women at a disadvantage compared to men. Flexible working can mean different things in different contexts. Some types of flexible working, e.g. the ability to work any seven-hour period between the hours of 8am and 6pm, might even be considered advantageous by some with childcare responsibilities. It seems to us that giving advance notice of the matters sought to be relied upon would reduce the scope for disagreement later. A matter in respect of which judicial notice may be taken, by its very nature, ought to be one that is uncontroversial. The fact that it is not might cast doubt on whether it really is so notorious and well-established that it can be accepted without further inquiry.  c. It is in the interests of fairness that the other party be given an opportunity to respond and comment. The Tribunal would be entitled to take judicial notice of a matter, notwithstanding any objection by the opposing party, if it is satisfied that that is warranted. However, the Tribunal may well be better placed to make that assessment once it has heard any argument to the contrary.  d. However, that does not mean that a party needs to plead the term &#8220;judicial notice&#8221; expressly in order for adequate notice to have been given. Depending on the context, the nature of the claim and, if relevant, the specialist nature of the tribunal, it might suffice if the allegation being made contains an assertion that could be established by evidence or by the taking of judicial notice. In a claim of indirect discrimination, an assertion that a particular PCP puts women at a disadvantage because of their childcare responsibilities as compared to men, would be sufficient, in our view, to identify a matter in respect of which judicial notice could be taken. The childcare disparity is very well-established. It is frequently referred to in the authorities (see above) and is also referred to in the EHRC Code of Practice, which the Tribunal is obliged to take into account. As such, there is little need for more to be said by way of pleading. Furthermore, as a specialist employment tribunal, the childcare disparity is a matter that falls within the scope of its specialist expert knowledge and can be taken into account without more. We consider that approach to be consistent with the general direction of travel of making it easier for litigants to establish claims of indirect discrimination, and the fact that claims are often brought by litigants in person, who may be aware of the childcare disparity, but who may have no knowledge of the principles relating to judicial notice.  e. The Claimant and the Intervenor appeared to go further in suggesting that the Tribunal was bound to take judicial notice of the childcare disparity even where there is no notice of the issue ... [but] the Tribunal cannot be treated as a &#8220;repository of knowledge&#8221; that will rush to the aid of a party whose case lacks clarity or would otherwise flounder for want of evidence.&#8221;</span></p>

Whether or not it is will depend on the interrelationship between the general position that is the result of the childcare disparity and the particular PCP in question. The childcare disparity means that women are more likely to find it difficult to work certain hours (e.g. nights) or changeable hours (where the changes are dictated by the employer) than men because of childcare responsibilities. If the PCP requires working to such arrangements, then the group disadvantage would be highly likely to follow from taking judicial notice of the childcare disparity. However, if the PCP as to flexible working requires working any period of 8 hours within a fixed window or involves some other arrangement that might not necessarily be more difficult for those with childcare responsibilities, then it would be open to the Tribunal to conclude that the group disadvantage is not made out. Judicial notice enables a fact to be established without specific evidence. However, that fact might not be sufficient on its own to establish the cause of action being relied upon. As is so often the case, the specific circumstances will have to be considered and one needs to guard against moving from an &#8220;indisputable fact&#8221; (of which judicial notice may be taken) to a &#8220;disputable gloss&#8221; (which may not be apt for judicial notice): see&#160;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">HM Chief Inspector of Education, Children&#8217;s Services and Skills v Interim Executive Board of Al-Hijrah School</span><span style="color:#000000">&#160;[2018] IRLR 334 (CA) at para 108.

An amendment before any evidence is called is quite different from a decision on liability or remedy which departs from the list of issues agreed at the start of the hearing. Another factor is whether the list of issues was the product of agreement between legal representatives. A third is whether amending the list of issues would delay or disrupt the hearing because one of the parties is not in a position to deal immediately with a new issue, or the length of the hearing would be expanded beyond the time allotted to it.&#8221;</span></p>

Tribunals sometimes make errors, having stated the principles correctly but slipping up in their application, as the case law demonstrates; but if the correct principles were in the tribunal's mind, as demonstrated by their being identified in the express terms of the decision, the tribunal can be expected to have been seeking faithfully to apply them, and to have done so unless the contrary is clear from the language of its decision. ...&#8221;</span></p>

As the respondent points out, the only person the claimant had identified as being subject to the application of the PCP was herself.  The ET had, however, found as a fact that the requirement in issue had been inserted into the job description for grade 3 managers and that the PCP was thus applied to all men and women employed in such roles.

Having found that the claimant was the only woman within the pool of grade 3 managers, the ET accepted her evidence as to the particular disadvantage she would suffer by reason of the application of the PCP: she was the primary care provider for two children under the age of five and the requirement to travel significant distances would not be compatible with her childcare commitments.  To the extent that the ET extrapolated from the claimant&#8217;s situation to reach its finding that the PCP would put female grade 3 managers, as a group, at a disadvantage, the respondent says it erred, in particular as it failed to consider whether the claimant&#8217;s circumstances were likely to be representative of the difficulties that women, employed at grade 3 manager level, might experience.  The respondent further points out that the ET made no findings as to the circumstances of the men who were employed as grade 3 managers, simply assuming (ET, paragraph 78) that &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">female Grade 3 managers, as primary carers, in comparison with male Grade 3 managers, would be put at a particular disadvantage by the requirement to travel significant distances</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">&#8221;.  </span></p>

No evidence had been led by either side as to the particular circumstances of the male grade 3 manager colleagues of the claimant, but it was the respondent&#8217;s case (summarised at paragraph 44 of its written closing submissions before the ET) that there were &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">no other employees at C&#8217;s level who are not required to travel</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">&#8221; and &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">there was no evidence ... of any other colleagues of C&#8217;s put at such a disadvantage</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">&#8221; (where &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">such a disadvantage</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">&#8221; was understood to relate to an inability to accommodate a requirement &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">to travel significant distances on 6-12 occasions a year</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">&#8221;).  In the circumstances &#8211; given the apparent acceptance by the respondent that the men within the pool of grade 3 managers suffered no disadvantage as a result of the application of the PCP &#8211; I cannot see that the ET erred in proceeding on the basis that the relevant male comparators did not suffer a similar disadvantage to that identified by the claimant.  </span></p>

It is, however, not necessarily an error of law for an ET to infer group disadvantage from the fact that there is a particular disadvantage in the individual case (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">per</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000"> </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">Dobson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">, paragraph 56).  Moreover, even if the claimant&#8217;s particular circumstances &#8211; whereby her husband would be unable to assist with the childcare difficulties presented by a requirement for the claimant to travel significant distances once a month &#8211; might not be representative of the position of many other women, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">disadvantage</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">&#8221; does not require that it is impossible to comply with the relevant PCP, it can be sufficient that there is a &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">real difficulty</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">&#8221; (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">Dobson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">, paragraph 53).  Thus, to the extent that the ET drew an inference from the claimant&#8217;s circumstances, it would have been entitled to see that as providing an example of the kind of disadvantage that other women might face arising from the childcare disparity.

Ms Ling suggested that the ET&#8217;s reference to a different paragraph number from the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">EHRC Code</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000"> (paragraph 4.11 being relevant to cases in which the link between PCP and disadvantage might be &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">obvious</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">&#8221;) suggests that this was in fact the point it had in mind.  However, a more substantive error of approach can (as the respondent urges) be implied from the fact that the ET&#8217;s reasoning then appears to suggest that there is an intrinsic link between childcare responsibilities and being a woman, apparently losing sight of the rather more nuanced characterisation of the childcare disparity provided by the EAT in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">Dobson</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">.</span></p>

Accepting, as I must, that the EAT&#8217;s role is not to comb through the reasoning of the ET to strive to uphold its conclusions (and see the observations in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">Anya</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000"> and </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">Frame</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000"> to this effect), somewhat reluctantly, I am drawn to the conclusion that the ET&#8217;s decision on disadvantage is rendered unsafe by the lack of clarity as to its approach.

For completeness, however, I note that the respondent had made clear that it did not accept that the childcare disparity necessarily gave rise to a particular disadvantage for women employed in roles comparable to the claimant&#8217;s.  Given the dispute thus identified, I can accept that, if the ET intended to draw upon its own understanding of the difficulties of finding childcare outside particular hours, it ought properly to have raised that issue and provided the respondent with the opportunity to make submissions in response.  That said, although relying on this as giving rise to a potential unfairness, the respondent&#8217;s criticism is essentially limited to suggesting the ET was wrong to consider that (absent live-in assistance) it was &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">only possible</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">&#8221; to secure childcare after 7 am and before 6 pm.  Whether the ET was correct to put the point so high, there does not seem to be any real dispute that cover at other times (absent live-in care provision) might well present difficulties for those who have the primary responsibility for childcare in a family (who, given the childcare disparity, are most likely to be women) and thus give rise to a disadvantage.  </span></p>

For the claimant it is objected that the ET&#8217;s judgment is adequate to its task: it had plainly concluded that the respondent had not established reasonable necessity and any paucity in the explanation provided arose from the absence of cogent evidence, rather than any error in the ET&#8217;s approach. </span></p>

If the answer to that question was that, having carried out the requisite critical evaluation, the ET was satisfied that the respondent had failed to discharge the burden it carried to show that this was a reasonably necessary way to achieve its aims of addressing staff moral and promote business efficacy, then its reasons needed to make this clear.

Accepting that, if the claimant&#8217;s case of indirect sex discrimination was properly to be upheld, the ET would inevitably have found any dismissal to have been unfair, Ms Seymour referred back to her earlier submissions and noted that the ET had not, in any event, gone on to actually consider the question of fairness for the purposes of section 98(4) </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">ERA</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">. </span></p>

On this point, it is the respondent&#8217;s case that the change thus identified by the ET arose from the fact that there had been a diminution in its requirement for employees at Helmshore to carry out work of the kind involved in managing field agents; that, it submits, was sufficient to meet the definition of redundancy under section 139 </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">ERA</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">.
