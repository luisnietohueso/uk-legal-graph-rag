      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Whistleblowing and protected disclosures; sex discrimination; victimisation</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The appellant was employed by the first respondent, Highways England, from March 2018. </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In early 2019, Highways England entered into a contract for management consultancy</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">services with the fourth respondent, KPMG. It was intended that the appellant would form</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">part of a team of Highways England employees who would engage with KPMG in its </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">performance of that contract.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The appellant subsequently presented claim forms to the employment tribunal in which she </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">made complaints against KPMG of being subjected to detriments on the ground of having</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">made protected disclosures (section 47B of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Employment Rights Act, 1996 </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">(&#8220;ERA&#8221;);</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">direct sex discrimination (section 13 of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Equality Act, 2010 </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">(&#8220;EqA&#8221;); and victimisation </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">(section 26 EqA). KPMG resisted all three claims on the basis that it had never been the </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">appellant&#8217;s employer. It requested a preliminary determination of that issue and also applied</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">for the claims against it to be struck out on the basis they had no reasonable prospect of </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">success. In the alternative, it sought a deposit order. The appellant accepted that she had no </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">express contract with KPMG, but submitted that she had an implied contract either of </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">employment or as a worker. In relation to her whistleblowing claim she submitted that, in any</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">event, KPMG was her employer under the extended definitions of &#8220;worker&#8221; and &#8220;employer&#8221;</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">in section 43K ERA. Alternatively, she submitted that, in its dealings with her, KPMG and / </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">or KPMG&#8217;s employees acted as agents of Highways England such that KPMG was liable</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">under section 47B(1A)(b) ERA and sections 109 and 110 EqA. Finally, she submitted that</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">KPMG had instructed caused, induced or aided Highways England to commit basic</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">contraventions against her such as to engage sections 111 and 112 EqA. </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">A preliminary hearing was fixed to determine the substantive issue of whether or not the </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">appellant had an implied contract with KPMG and to consider the applications for strike-</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">out / deposit order. Having heard evidence on the substantive issue, the tribunal concluded </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">that the appellant had failed to establish the existence of any implied contract between her </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">and KPMG. It struck out her complaints against KPMG under section 47B ERA and 13, 26</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">and 112 EqA on the basis that they had no reasonable prospect of success. The tribunal&#8217;s </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">reasons referred to the section 111 complaint, but no reference was made in its judgment to</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">the complaint under that section.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Held: </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The employment tribunal was correct to conclude that the appellant had failed to </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">establish any implied contract between her and KPMG. It had erred, however, in striking</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">out her compliants under section 47B ERA and sections 13 and 26 and 112 EqA. KPMG </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">could potentially be liable under those sections without having any direct contractual</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">relationship with the appellant. Potential grounds for such liability included the argument</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">that KPMG was acting at the material time as an agent of Highways England and, in respect</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">of the section 47B ERA complaint, that KPMG fell within the extended definition of </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;employer&#8221; in section 43K ERA. The section 112 complaint might also be established on </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">the basis that KPMG had &#8220;knowingly helped&#8221; Highways England to commit a basic </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">contravention against the appellant. All of these issues were fact sensitive and could not</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">properly be determined in the context of an application for strike-out. The employment </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">tribunal should, however, have struck out the complaint under section 111</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">EqA having regard to the terms of section 111(7) EqA.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The judgment of the employment tribunal was, therefore, set aside. A determination in fact </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">and law was substituted that there was no implied contract between the appellant and KPMG</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">at any time to which the appellant&#8217;s claims against KPMG relate. The complaint against </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">KPMG under section 111 EqA was struck out, and the case was thereafter remitted to the </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">employment tribunal. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.3in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The claims have a protracted procedural history. The appellant plainly feels very strongly about the merits of her complaints. Identifying with any clarity the factual and legal grounds for those complaints has, however, proved to be difficult. Prior to the hearing which resulted in the judgment now under appeal, the employment tribunal made extensive efforts to do so between 2019 and 2021. The normal principles of written pleading were largely abandoned. Instead, the complaints were particularised in notes produced by judges after lengthy in-person case management hearings. One of these &#8211; in November 2020 before EJ Camp &#8211; took 2 days. Another &#8211; in November 2021 before EJ Flood &#8211; took 3 days. The latter resulted in a substantial hearing note and a case management order dated 17 December 2021 which contained, amongst other matters, a list of the issues for the preliminary hearing which has led to this appeal .</span></p>

Understandably, having regard to the terms of the EAT Practice Direction, these were not permitted to proceed to a full hearing. Instead, a preliminary hearing was held on 29 February 2023 at which HHJ Shanks heard from the appellant in person. At that hearing, the grounds of appeal were substantially amended and were limited to six numbered paragraphs. These were then recorded by HHJ Shanks in an Order dated 29 February 2023 and permitted to proceed to a full hearing.  </span></p>

The appellant represented herself. The respondents were represented by counsel. At the start of the appeal, I reminded the appellant that the scope of the appeal was limited to the six grounds which had been allowed to proceed at sift. As the appeal progressed, however, it became clear that the appellant&#8217;s understanding of her grounds was, in some respects, different to mine. That being so, I considered all points that the appellant sought to advance and applied a broad interpretation to the permitted grounds of appeal. </span></p>

In early 2019, Highways England engaged the fourth respondent, KPMG, as a contractor to provide management consultancy services (ET &#167; 24). KPMG&#8217;s role under its contract with Highways England included the provision of advice on how processes might be improved and a review of a system known as Oracle Fusion on which the appellant worked (ET &#167; 24-26).

To decide this question a Tribunal must make a summary assessment of the available material and is not required to hold a mini trial of the issues. It would not be usual for evidence to be considered at this summary assessment stage. There is clearly going to be some crossover in this particular matter, as the preliminary hearing will also determine a substantive point, namely whether there was an implied contract between KPMG and the claimant. This may well touch on some of the arguments on agency and other matters. For that reason I consider that a further order for specific disclosure on the agency issue should be made as set out below.&#8221;</span></p>

When she attended meetings with KPMG, that was only to assist KPMG in fulfilling its contract with Highways England, and KPMG had no right to insist upon her attendance (ET &#167; 70). In the time that KPMG was contractually involved with Highways England, the appellant had two meetings with KPMG (ET &#167; 52). The appellant was unable to identify in her evidence any specific work she carried out for KPMG (ET &#167; 52) or any terms and conditions of the implied contract the existence of which she claimed (ET &#167; 56).</span></p>

In that context, her involvement with KPMG was explained by the fact that she was an employee of Highways England.

It noted that agency is a fiduciary relationship which exists between two persons, one of whom expressly or impliedly gives permission to the other to act on his behalf and to affect his legal relations with third parties. It is not appropriate to describe someone employed by a contractor as an agent simply because they performed work for the benefit of a third-party employer (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Kemeh v.

Accordingly, the mere fact that KPMG was employed as a contractor by Highways England did not of itself give rise to any reasonable prospect of showing that KPMG (or any of KPMG&#8217;s employees) was, as a result, an agent of Highways England. The contract between Highways England and KPMG made clear that KPMG was merely providing a consultancy service, and clause 50.1 of that contract stated that nothing in its terms should be taken as creating the relationship of principal and agent between the parties, or as authorising either party to make representations or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of the other. </span></p>

As the tribunal correctly recognised in this case, it is not generally open to the tribunal which is considering an application for strike out to conduct an impromptu trial of the facts. There may, of course, be cases where the central facts in the case are undisputed or where it is instantly demonstrable that a claimant&#8217;s averments in the pleadings are untrue. There may also be cases where the claim is plainly irrelevant or incompetent as a matter of law.

The issue for the tribunal was not whether the appellant had reasonable prospects of establishing that, as a generality, KPMG acted as an agent for Highways England. Rather, the issue was whether KPMG and / or its employees could be said to have done so expressly or by necessary implication on any of the particular occasions when the contraventions of the relevant legislation are said to have occurred.

Those facts could only be properly explored at a full hearing. There is also a consideration of procedural fairness. The agency point was only ever expected to be considered in the context of a strike out application rather than by a full examination of the facts or a mini trial of evidence.
