		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.75in">&#8220;The conduct complained about is that the failure to respond to the drop hands offer, and I note what is submitted that that does not amount to an offer, but it is that, and then further, to the timing that the discontinuance was made and the reason for the discontinuance.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.75in">In the DJ having set out that the failure to accept the previous offers does not amount to unreasonable behaviour and the rejection of offers does not amount to unreasonable behaviour, it would appear that the finding of unreasonable behaviour had been tipped by the timing at which the notice of discontinuance was made and was influenced by the reason it was made, namely that the Claimant considered it was not economically viable to proceed. </p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.75in">There was no requirement for the Claimant to set out a reason of discontinuance. The test in <span style="font-style:italic">Ridehalgh</span> is to ensure as to whether the conduct complained of permits reasonable explanation. The conduct, as I have just set out, is the act of discontinuance and the act of not responding and accepting the late drop hands offer.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.75in">The test of unreasonable behaviour is not a low bar and in view of the matters set out I find that there is a real prospect of success to the submission that the DJ was wrong to find unreasonable behaviour in the circumstances, notably on that specific point that I have just set out, about the reason for discontinuance, and therefore I grant permission to appeal. I do, however, note this is by far a straightforward appeal, as noted by my refusal on paper indicates&#8221;.</p>

However, in this case, the claimant&#8217;s position is that the arithmetic did not add up, arithmetic readily available from the outset, and in the context of its decision of commercial unviability it reflects that it was not going to proceed to trial. </span></p>

I do consider there is a need for parties to be able to discontinue their cases brought on the small claims track without there being a too readily immediate risk of a costs order. There is real concern that if costs, save for court fees, are awarded too freely on the small claims track it runs contrary to the intention of Part 27 of the CPR and may have a deterrent effect to bringing claims, which in turn would impact on access to justice. However, when considering the circumstances of this case, the claimant&#8217;s solicitor failed to respond to matters raised by the defendant&#8217;s solicitors for over 8 months. Critically to the decision in this case, the claimant&#8217;s solicitors then failed to respond in a period of 9 days set out by the defendant&#8217;s solicitors in their correspondence on 22 May 2024 knowing that thereafter the defendant&#8217;s solicitors would proceed to instructing counsel.

It would be manifestly unfair to the defendant in these circumstances if it was to be faced with absorbing all those costs caused by such unreasonable behaviour. I do not consider the reference to the tables for fixed costs for claims on the small claims track or intermediate track under CPR 44 is particularly helpful, as CPR 27.14(2)(g) is a separate mechanism for the recovery of costs following a finding of unreasonable behaviour.</span></p>

With that in mind, it is perhaps useful for me to set out an approach which may assist parties in similar situations. It is an approach which has echoes, to some extent, of the test for applications for relief from sanction, but with modification to the particular circumstances. Such a test is well understood by practitioners and injects a practical approach. However, parties and the court must not fall into a trap of considering there is any such breach from the outset, as that would be to put the cart before the horse, and hence the need for modification of the test.

Conversely, if the conduct is sufficiently serious or significant, then assessment must move on to consider the next stage.
