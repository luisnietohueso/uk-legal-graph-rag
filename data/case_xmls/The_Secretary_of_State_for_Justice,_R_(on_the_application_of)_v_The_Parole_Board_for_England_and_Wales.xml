	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this claim the Secretary of State for Justice seeks to quash an order of 5 October 2023 by which the Duty Member of the Parole Board (&#8220;the Board&#8221;) directed that some of the sensitive material (&#8220;the contested material&#8221;) supplied to the Board by the Secretary of State should be served on the Special Advocate so that he could make submissions in CLOSED as to its relevance.  The Secretary of State had supplied the material to the Board at its request but asserted that it was irrelevant to the issue before the Board.  That issue was whether the Interested Party, Mr Abdal Raouf Abdallah (&#8220;Mr. Abdallah&#8221;), was suitable for release or whether the public interest required that he should be detained until his sentence expiry date.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 11 July 2016, Mr Abdallah was convicted of terrorism offences. On 15 July 2016, he was sentenced to an extended determinate sentence of 9&#189; years and a sentence of 2 years imprisonment (to run concurrently).   Mr Abdallah was released on licence on 26 November 2020. His licence was revoked and he was recalled to custody on 18 January 2021. As a recalled prisoner not suitable for automatic release under s.255A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, Mr Abdallah&#8217;s case was referred to the Board by the Secretary of State in accordance with s.255C of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 30 June 2021 the Secretary of State applied to the Board to withhold material from Mr Abdallah and his legal representative, pursuant to Rule 17 of the Parole Board Rules 2019/1038 (&#8220;the 2019 Rules&#8221;).   The Board granted that application on 4 August 2021 and Mr Abdallah was provided with an &#8216;OPEN gist&#8217; of the withheld material. Mr Abdallah appealed that decision and filed grounds of appeal dated 27 August 2021. </p>

The Secretary of State&#8217;s position was that the material was irrelevant; and accordingly, the Department did not serve the material and submissions on the Special Advocate. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Duty Member invited further submissions. The Secretary of State filed submissions on the approach to relevance on 24 July 2023.  The Duty Member considered the Secretary of State&#8217;s July submissions and, on 7 August 2023, directed further submissions.  The Special Advocate filed submissions on 22 September 2023 and the Secretary of State filed submissions in response on 3 October 2023. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In a determination dated 5 October 2023 the Duty Member held that the Board had the power to direct the production of potentially relevant material and &#8220;that the starting point is that material directed to be produced must be served upon the Special Advocate&#8221;.  The Duty Member accordingly directed that the material in issue be served on the Special Advocate by 13 October 2023 with consequential directions for submissions on relevance.   This is the first ruling challenged in these proceedings.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 20 October 2023 the Secretary of State applied pursuant to Rule 6(5) of the Parole Board Rules to revoke the 5 October 2023 direction on the basis that the Duty Member had erred in law.  The Special Advocate filed submissions in response to that application on 31 October 2023.  On 30 November 2023, the Duty Member refused the Secretary of State&#8217;s application.  This is the second ruling challenged in these proceedings.</p>

	    <num>10.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The rulings of 5 October and 30 November were based on the same reasoning and the submissions filed in the context of the revocation application were in substance the same as those filed prior to the first ruling.  The issue before us is whether the ruling of the 5 October 2023 directing disclosure of the contested material to the Special Advocate was within the power of the Duty Member who made it and, if so, whether he erred in his discretion when making it such that it should be quashed.  The ruling of 30 November stands or falls with the October ruling.</p>

	    <num>11.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings were then commenced by the Secretary of State.  A request for interim relief was made staying the implementation of the order pending the determination of this claim.  It was refused.  The contested material was disclosed to the Special Advocate who agreed that it was irrelevant.  No CLOSED proceedings in relation to the contested material were ever held.  The Board determined that Mr Abdallah should not be released after OPEN and CLOSED hearings (involving other sensitive material with which we are not concerned).  He remained in prison until his sentence expiry date which was the 26 November 2024.  The issue which we have to decide is academic from his point of view since he is no longer serving the sentence, and he does not challenge the decision not to release him in these proceedings.  Specifically, no party suggests that the contested material was relevant to the issue before the Board, which was whether Mr Abdallah should be released before 26 November 2024.</p>

This argument rests on the construction of Rule 17(8) and (9) of the 2019 Rules which allow the Board to direct the appointment of a Special Advocate only when deciding that material should be withheld from the prisoner and his representative under the earlier provisions of that Rule.  The Rule therefore contemplates that at the time when the relevance decision is made there will be no Special Advocate; and</p>

The present case is one of very few cases where there is a Special Advocate, and the only case where counsel to the Board has been appointed to fulfil a role ostensibly similar to that of counsel to the Tribunal in the Investigative Powers Tribunal (&#8220;the IPT&#8221;).  The Investigatory Powers Tribunal Rules SI 2018/1334 rules 7 and 12 mean that in the IPT no Special Advocates can be appointed and Counsel to the Tribunal performs functions which are designed to assist the IPT in ensuring fairness in cases where material is not disclosed to the claimant.  The situation which prevailed in these proceedings before the Board was therefore not actually similar to the way the IPT conducts its business.</p>

Prior to that, because the judge granting permission, Heather Williams J, refused to stay the order made by the Duty Member, the contested material was in fact disclosed to the Special Advocate.  Whether there was jurisdiction to direct that this should happen is now academic because it has happened.  It follows that in reality there is nothing in issue in these proceedings because any decision by the Board in Mr Abdallah&#8217;s case has been overtaken by events and there is no longer any question for the Board to determine. The dispute between the parties over the decision of the Duty Member which is the subject matter of this case is now entirely moot. This is a change of circumstances from when permission to apply for judicial review was granted on 21 February 2024. At that time the hearing of Mr Abdallah&#8217;s application was in prospect, and the question of the treatment of this material was a live issue. Whilst when granting permission to apply for judicial review the judge referred to the aspiration of the Secretary of State to have a ruling on the point raised in the case for the benefit of other future cases, we have the benefit of additional material and have heard argument on the question of whether we should accept jurisdiction to determine the issues in the current circumstances.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his submissions, Sir James Eadie KC, on behalf of the Secretary of State, submitted that there was a residual discretion for the court to consider academic disputes in appropriate cases. The present case was concerned with a discrete question in respect of the correct construction of the Parole Board Rules 2019, in particular Rule 17,  and therefore lends itself to being resolved notwithstanding that Mr Abdallah has been released. The point which was the subject of the dispute was an important one for the Secretary of State and the Board. The provisions of the Senior Courts Act 1981 did not remove the jurisdiction to hear cases where there were no live issues if there was justification for doing so, and there was justification in the present case. The Board has taken a neutral stance in relation to this litigation and Mr Forster KC, having pointed out that the case is now academic, made no further submissions on this issue. Mr Bunting KC in both his written and his oral submissions on behalf of Mr Abdallah, drew attention to the fact that there was no longer any live dispute.  He pointed out that, applying the authorities, it was an exacting standard to demonstrate that an academic case should be heard and determined. He noted that the case was a one-off and that it related to a case management decision which, in accordance with the Parole Board Rules 2019, would not be published or otherwise reported. He submitted, therefore, that the court should decline to determine the dispute.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question of whether a court should proceed to hear a judicial review case in which the outcome is academic has been addressed previously, in particular in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex p Salem </span>[1999] 1 AC 450, in which Lord Slynn recognised that there was a discretion for the court to hear a case even where there was no longer any issue to be decided. That case concerned an appeal by a person seeking asylum who challenged the decision of the Secretary of State for the Home Department to notify the Department of Social Security that the applicant&#8217;s claim to asylum had been determined, thereby leading to the cancellation of his benefits. The refusal of his claim had been recorded on an internal file, but not communicated to the appellant. Prior to the case coming on before the House of Lords the appellant&#8217;s appeal had been allowed and his benefits restored and there was, therefore, no live issue to be determined. Nonetheless the appellant was keen for the court to hear the case on the basis that it raised important points of law of public importance which should be resolved. </p>

Having reviewed earlier authorities Lord Slynn observed the following in giving the reasons for dismissing the appeal, at 456G-457B:</p>

The decisions in the <span style="font-style:italic">Sun Life</span> case and <span style="font-style:italic">Ainsbury v Millington</span> (and the reference to the letter in rule 42 of the Practice Directions applicable to Civil Appeals (January 1996) of your Lordships&#8217; House) must be read accordingly as limited to disputes concerning private law rights between the parties to the case.</p>

Although these statements indicate that if an issue is academic, the court cannot determine it, these statements must be subject to what was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Salem</span> and which has, as far as I can discover, not been disapproved of or qualified in any manner in any later case.  </p>

The first condition is in the words of Lord Slynn in <span style="font-style:italic">Salem</span> (supra) that &#8220;a large number of similar cases exist or anticipated&#8221; or at least other similar cases exist or are anticipated and the second condition is that the decision in the academic case will not be fact-sensitive. If the courts entertained academic disputes in the type of application now before the court but which did not satisfy each of these two conditions, the consequence would be a regrettable waste of valuable court time and incurring by one or more parties of unnecessary costs.   </p>

After all one of those overriding objectives is &#8220;dealing with a case justly [which] includes, so far as is practicable&#8230; (e) allotting to it an appropriate share of the court&#8217;s resources while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases&#8221; (CPR Part 1.1)&#8230;&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view the important principle to take from these and other authorities which could have been cited and which take a similar approach, is that it is necessary for there to be exceptional circumstances to justify a court proceeding to determine a case which is academic or moot. In paragraph 36 of his judgment Silber J was not laying down an exhaustive or comprehensive list of the conditions which might justify hearing cases of this kind: the potential conditions which might amount to exceptional circumstances cannot be sensibly codified. However, it is clear to me that the two factors which Silber J identified as his examples, namely the number of other cases in which the issue may arise and whether the case is fact sensitive, will be matters to which the court will no doubt wish to have regard in considering the issue of whether to determine the case on the merits.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It appears clear that these amendments were made in order to ensure that judicial review was purposeful and that relief would not be granted where the &#8220;outcome&#8230;would not have been substantially different&#8221;. A case in which there is no live question and the dispute was or has become academic is a paradigm example of such a case since the issue will have been resolved and the question of what, if any, relief should be granted will not be a live issue. This reinforces the caution which has to be exercised in embarking on the determination of academic questions in litigation. Whilst it was pointed out in the course of argument that section 31(2B) permits the hearing of cases where the outcome would not have been substantially different &#8220;for reasons of exceptional public interest&#8221;, in my view that makes clear the high hurdle which needs to be surmounted in cases of this kind. To proceed to determine the case must not simply be in the public interest but an exceptional public interest must be demonstrated. As a further safeguard, section 31(2C) requires the discipline of certification of the reasons of exceptional public interest. Thus, whilst there remains an undoubted discretion for the court to proceed to determine academic cases where there are no live issues between the parties to resolve, these provisions further emphasise the caution and restraint which needs to be exercised in concluding that there are the necessary exceptional circumstances to justify that course being taken.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having set out the legal context the question then arises as to whether exceptional circumstances have been demonstrated in this case. It is true to say that the question which the court is asked to determine in this case is one of construction of the Parole Board Rules 2019. This is a factor which favours the determination of the issues but only in relation to Ground 1, the ultra vires argument. Ground 2 is a fact specific contention in respect of the exercise of discretion by the Duty Member, as to which it was clarified at the hearing that the Secretary of State relied upon the failure to take account of material considerations. As such, I am entirely satisfied that there is no longer any proper basis to resolve Ground 2. Even in respect of Ground 1 there are, however, other aspects of the context of this dispute which in my view strongly suggest that there are no exceptional circumstances which could warrant the determination of questions which are raised in this case in circumstances where the interested party has already completed his sentence and been released.</p>

The details of those cases are set out by Mr Atkins in the witness statement and none of them raised the issue which arises in the present case. It appears, therefore, that far from there being numerous cases that might depend on the resolution of the issues before us, this case is presently unique. In our view that is a factor which weighs very heavily against exercising our discretion to determine it.</p>

In cases of this kind the factual context of the dispute may be of assistance to a court seeking to address the points of construction that arise for decision. The detail of the facts relating to the dispute about relevance of contested material may be of use to the court by adding context to the construction exercise.  In this case there was no such dispute.  When the Special Advocate saw it, he agreed with the Secretary of State that it was irrelevant.  Construing statutory provisions in a vacuum is a dangerous exercise.  This a further reason to decline to determine the dispute. </p>

There are not exceptional circumstances demonstrated in this case which would pass the scrutiny required by either the extant authorities or the provisions of Section 31(2A) to (2C) of the 1981 Act. The certified reasons required by section 31(2C) are simply absent. Whilst this case concerns a point of construction of the 2019 Rules, the case is, so far as the evidence discloses, a one-off and there are no others awaiting any outcome from this case.   For all of these reasons I have concluded that it would be inappropriate to proceed to resolve the issues which have been raised by the Secretary of State and this application for judicial review must be dismissed.</p>
