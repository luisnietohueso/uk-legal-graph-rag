POC [41] to [44] relies on the value of the commissions which had accrued to CFB and were held by CMC as evidence of the value of CFB both at the time of the Migration Agreement and prospectively in relation to future commissions. The claim is advanced on the basis that a transfer for a consideration of &#163;1 was significantly less that the value of the CFB clients to CFC/CMC and thus undervalued CFB at the time of the Offending Transactions. The claimant submits that in entering into the Offending Transactions the defendants stripped CFB of a valuable asset (its clients) and revenue stream (future commissions) for nominal consideration leaving it with the Dubai judgment which it could not then pay.</p>

The evidence suggests that at least as between CFB and CFC there had been some intention to achieve the transfer of clients to CFC from 2017. On the evidence available those discussions were proximate in time to when the claimant had started to complain to CFB about her losses. CMC having accrued a right to immediately terminate by at latest the Dubai judgment did not do so.

The court needs to take into account when considering the location of the parties and the witnesses that the claimant has chosen to commence her claim in England, CFB has not engaged in the claim at all, and CMC is an English registered company with the benefit of an English law and jurisdiction clause. Further the location of witnesses is not a significant factor when in most cases evidence can be given remotely by video link. No party focussed on any of these issues for the purposes of forum.</p>

She says they are English assets. Certainly, the commissions generated by the investments on the CMC platform are generated as a consequence of those investments as are any fees for CMC and it seems likely they would be English assets. But it seems to me the real assets are the migrated CFB clients who invest on the CMC platform pursuant to a direct contractual arrangement with CMC albeit with an agency arrangement with CFC and generate the entitlement to commission for CFC and fees for CMC.  They are in the UAE.  The consequence of the migration is that the clients of CMC who generate the commissions and fees will be investing under an agency agreement with CFC. And given the terms of the Migration Agreement it is likely that each of those CMC clients will have entered into an agreement with CMC on similar terms to the CMC Account including the English law and jurisdiction clause. If the Offending Transactions are unravelled the income stream arises in England but assuming it has been paid it will have been paid to CFC in Dubai.</p>

CFB commenced proceedings for its own insolvency in Dubai leading to the Liquidation judgment and the Liquidation Order.

This appears to be something of a half-life where third parties/creditors can still seek to take action to enforce their claims against the company. The claimant can still therefore take action against CFB to enforce the Dubai judgment, but CFB is not trading or otherwise active. Although CFB is now the subject of a Liquidation Order its status appears to be similar to that of a company that has ceased to trade. It is not described as being in liquidation despite it following on from the Liquidation judgment and the appointment of a liquidator. Phase 1 appears to be similar to the process by which a company ceases to trade and starts to wind up its affairs.</p>

The Liquidation judgement sets out the steps which Mr Mohebi was required to take to enable the expert accountant to complete phase 1. Despite over two years having passed since the Liquidation Order was made registration has not taken place. It does not appear that Mr Mohebi has taken the steps required to enable the dissolution and registration to take place to enable CFB to move from phase 1 to phase 2. There is no indication when the work necessary might be complete and when CFB might move to phase 2. The experts agree that phase 1 one runs from the date of the Liquidation Order until the opening of the enforcement file following dissolution and registration. </p>

Assuming that took say 9 months she would then have to work through the process of getting from phase 1 to phase 2. Mr Mohebi has not achieved that in two years. Whilst there may be reasons for that delay clearly the process of obtaining a Liquidation Order and Judgment will take time and the claimant will therefore have to incur the time and costs of taking fresh bankruptcy proceedings in the UAE simply to get to a position where a liquidator may take some action to investigate the affairs of CFB.</p>

It is not necessary to reach any concluded view on that issue but if there is a risk that any claim in the UAE might not be possible yet or at all that is obviously a factor to take into account.

That is often the case where parties are undertaking business across jurisdictions.  It does mean that where parties irrevocably agree to determine their disputes in a particular jurisdiction that that factor should carry particular weight. The neutrality or equality of the many of the factors in this claim do still demonstrate some connection with this jurisdiction which add weight to the other factors which more clearly weigh in favour of there being a sufficient connection with this jurisdiction. For example, the payment of the commissions to CFC which appears to be the focus of the remedies are monies which accrue to CFC&#8217;s benefit through the CMC platform and are then sent to them by CMC. </p>
