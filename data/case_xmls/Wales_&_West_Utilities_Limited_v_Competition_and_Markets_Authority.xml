	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">On 22 March 2023, Green LJ granted permission to the Claimant to apply for judicial review of the Defendant&#8217;s decision dated 28 October 2021, on all then extant grounds, an application which is yet to be listed. By order of Ritchie J, made on 2 September 2024 and later amended under the slip rule, three applications are before me, as follows: (1) the Defendant&#8217;s application dated 26 May 2023, for an order that the Sixth Interested Party (Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission Plc &#8211; &#8216;SSEN-T&#8217;) is not an interested party and striking out its detailed grounds in support of the Claimant&#8217;s claim, alternatively striking out specified parts of its detailed grounds and/or refusing permission for judicial review on the ground of &#8216;Cost of Equity&#8217;; (2) SSEN-T&#8217;s application, dated 13 June 2023, to intervene in the proceedings, under CPR 54.17, contingent upon the grant of the Defendant&#8217;s application; and (3) the Claimant&#8217;s application for directions, dated 8 June 2023. As will be apparent from the dates of those orders and applications, regrettably this matter was overlooked by the court office following the order made by Green LJ.</p>

Amongst the grounds of appeal advanced by every appellant was the so-called &#8216;Cost of Equity&#8217; ground, by which it was asserted that the cost of equity selected by GEMA had been too low and, thus, wrong. Each grant of permission was made conditional upon common grounds of appeal being considered together. The Cost of Equity ground was designated &#8216;Joined Ground A&#8217;. On 11 August 2021, the Defendant issued its provisional determination of the appeals (&#8216;the Provisional Determination&#8217;). It was not persuaded that GEMA had erred in its approach to, or estimate of, the cost of equity. On 3 September 2021, SSEN-T made detailed written submissions which included its contention that the Provisional Determination contained material errors of law in relation to the cost of equity ground of appeal, through application of the wrong legal test. Together with all other appellants, SSEN&#8211;T also submitted a joint response on Cost of Equity. </p>

Contrary to the approach adopted by GEMA and followed by the Defendant, it is said, on the proper construction of the statute, the financing duty is one of the matters to which both GEMA and the Defendant must have regard as an intrinsic part of their principal objective, rather than having a subordinate status, and is a duty requiring an outcome to be achieved rather than a mere duty of process. Moreover, both GEMA and the Defendant are said to be required to assess the &#8216;financeability&#8217; of individual companies, including, in particular, in respect of the cost of debt, rather than adopting a &#8216;one size fits all&#8217; approach, arrived at by sector averaging, for the &#8216;notional&#8217; company;</p>

The quashing and remittal relief sought by the Claimant in its claim form is said to relate exclusively to the disposal of the Claimant&#8217;s own appeal and to require a declaration in abstract terms as to the approach to the standard of review which the Defendant should follow in appeals under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/44" uk:canonical="1986 c. 44" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref>, as set out in the Claimant&#8217;s Statement of Facts and Grounds.

The [Defendant&#8217;s] failure to intervene in respect of GEMA&#8217;s unduly low Cost of Equity figure has deprived SSEN-T and other licensees of many millions of pounds of revenue over the next five years. This is particularly problematic in circumstances where considerable investment needs to be made by licensees in order even to be on the minimum pathway to achieve mandatory legislated &#8220;Net Zero&#8221; targets. Moreover, if left uncorrected by the High Court, the [Defendant&#8217;s] failure properly to carry out its statutory role stands to have a distorting effect on future price controls, as GEMA will feel emboldened to proceed as it wishes without the prospect of the type of robust merits review by the [Defendant] which Parliament intended.&#8217;</span></p>

Accordingly, it contends, SSEN-T cannot be an interested party on that basis either, a conclusion said to be sound as a matter of principle because there is no claim for relief, beyond declaratory relief, which affects the proceedings to which SSEN-T was a party below.</p>

Furthermore, it is said, SSEN-T&#8217;s grounds go further in asserting that the Defendant misapplied its own erroneous interpretation of the standard of review when determining the Cost of Equity.</p>

The only appellant to have challenged the Final Determination by way of judicial review had been the Claimant, SSEN-T having chosen not to bring a claim. The Defendant submits that none of the Claimant&#8217;s grounds of review concerns the Cost of Equity and that, prior to the grant of permission by Green LJ, the Claimant had confirmed its abandonment of its former Ground Five. It is submitted that: SSEN-T has sought impermissibly to use the Claimant&#8217;s claim as a means of advancing new and additional complaints about the Defendant&#8217;s decision as it relates to the Cost of Equity, which fall outside the scope of the Claimant&#8217;s claim; consideration of those issues will not affect the outcome of the claim, or lead to any relief which affects SSEN-T&#8217;s legal position, nor will it affect the Court&#8217;s determination of the legal issue engaged by Ground One; and that SSEN-T&#8217;s grounds will substantially increase the cost and complexity of proceedings. Whilst the Court would need to have regard to examples of the asserted percolation of the alleged errors throughout the entire Final Determination, and it is not contended that illustration could form no part of that argument, the Claimant has not itself advanced an illustration and SSEN-T&#8217;s pleaded case extends far beyond the latter and seeks to shore up a deficiency in the Claimant&#8217;s case; a matter of relevance to proportionality.</p>

It is said that SSEN-T is seeking to hijack the present proceedings to relitigate the substantive issue of the allowance for cost of equity which was rejected by the Defendant on appeal, in circumstances in which it would not and could not be entitled to any relief in these proceedings affecting its own position. That is said to be both impermissible and abusive. GEMA expresses its concern that the extensive statutory scrutiny and appeal process is being misused. SSEN-T is said opportunistically to be seeking to re-open a substantive issue, accompanied by a bundle exceeding 1,000 pages. Albeit characterised as an illustration of the error asserted by Ground One, it is, in substance, a new and distinct ground of challenge and it is noted that the Claimant has not once mentioned the cost of equity within Ground One. Possible implications for a prospective interested party in putative future litigation arising from future energy licence modification appeals are said not to constitute a &#8216;sufficient interest&#8217; in this claim: <span style="font-style:italic">R (Megarry) v Legal Aid Board </span>[1994] COD 468; and <span style="font-style:italic">R (Mencap) v Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2010/875" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCA Civ 875" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWCA Civ 875</ref>, at [23]-[24].</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">There is said to be a parallel regime under CPR Part 54 for a party who is not directly affected by the relief sought in a claim to be heard, by way of intervention. CPR 54.17(1) permits any person to apply for permission to file evidence, or make representations, at the hearing of the judicial review, and PD 54A provides, at  paragraph 13.6, that the Court may grant such permission on conditions and give case management directions. PD54A further provides, at paragraph 13.2, that the Court is unlikely to accede to an application to intervene if it would have the consequence of delaying the hearing. In this way, the CPR are said to strike an appropriate balance between affording third parties an opportunity to be heard &#8212; in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as the Court considers appropriate &#8212; without prejudicing the parties and the interests of justice by delaying the proceedings. SSEN-T&#8217;s submissions, as set out in its detailed Grounds, would substantially de-rail the hearing of the claim, causing significant additional delay. Any such application to intervene on the terms there set out would, no doubt, be refused. SSEN-T could have made an application for permission to intervene, but cannot avoid the need to obtain the Court&#8217;s permission by re-badging its intervention as being that of an interested party. </p>

The permission stage is an important filter in judicial review, preventing unarguable grounds from wasting valuable Court time and resources. In the absence of that filter, as applied to additional claims by interested parties, judicial review claims would risk derailment by such parties, occasioning significant cost and delay to the main proceedings. If SSEN-T were permitted to bring this new ground of review within the existing proceedings, it is said, the Defendant and GEMA would require the opportunity to file new detailed grounds of resistance, addressing the new substantive arguments raised by SSEN-T. CPR Part 54 does not put defendants and interested parties to the trouble of responding to a claim without the Court first having accepted that it has been brought within time and is arguable. SSEN-T ought not to be able to circumvent those important procedural protections in the manner here attempted. </p>

SSEN-T&#8217;s Detailed Grounds would necessitate a further round of pleadings, would materially lengthen the time for any hearing, and would therefore likely cause further delay to the Claimant&#8217;s grounds being determined by the Court.

Those grounds are said to identify a number of concrete examples of the Defendant&#8217;s failure to have determined for itself the merits of issues raised before it in the appeals, and justification of that failure by reference to its incorrect conclusions on the standard of review which it was required statutorily to apply.  SSEN-T contends that it, together with all other appellants, has been properly identified as an interested party since service of the claim form and cannot be removed simply because the Defendant does not wish to engage with its grounds. Not only is it directly affected by the claim but it is required to be joined as an interested party by paragraph 4.6(2) of CPR PD 54, as a party to proceedings before a &#8216;tribunal&#8217; (an undefined term).

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">The Claimant submits the reality of the situation to be that the Defendant is seeking to suppress valid points raised by SSEN-T which strengthen the Claimant&#8217;s case and undermine the Defendant&#8217;s defence. It says that its claim is a challenge to the Final Determination and Order as defined in the Claim Form and that the appeal which it had brought to the Defendant had had six heads, including Cost of Debt (designated letter &#8216;A&#8217;) and Cost of Equity (designated letter &#8216;B&#8217;). The grounds set out in the notice of appeal for both such heads had shared a key common theme; that GEMA had &#8216;erred in law&#8217; in the way in which it had approached its statutory duties. That had been expanded upon in relation to Cost of Debt and Cost of Equity. In respect of the latter, the Claimant had submitted that, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;OFGEM&#8217;s misinterpretation of its statutory duties...must be assumed to have infected OFGEM&#8217;s thinking, methodology and decisions in relation to the cost of equity in the same manner as it did in relation to the cost of debt.&#8217;</span> In its reply to GEMA&#8217;s response to the appeal, the Claimant had raised a number of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;cross cutting issues&#8217;</span>, one of which had been <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;OFGEM&#8217;s approach to this appeal as a matter of law&#8217;</span>. Its summary of its position in relation to all of its grounds of appeal had been that, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;OFGEM&#8217;s approach to the appeal as a whole appears to be to suggest that, so long as it has followed due process and exercised its discretion, there is no basis for the CMA to interfere with its decisions&#8217;</span>. In relation to GEMA&#8217;s interpretation of its statutory duties, the Claimant had confirmed that, as well as being relevant to Cost of Debt, it <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;in particular &#8230; form[ed] an integral part of [the Claimant&#8217;s] case in relation to the cost of equity and outperformance heads of appeal&#8217;</span>.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">The Cost of Equity had been addressed as a Joint Ground, as had been the ground of appeal relating to Licence Modifications (former Ground Five in these proceedings). Where a ground of appeal had been unique to a particular appellant, the Defendant had dealt with it separately. Sitting above its Provisional Determination on both the Joint Grounds and the Individual Grounds had been the Defendant&#8217;s overall interpretation of its role as the statutory appellate body, with which SSEN-T had taken issue. The Final Determination had adopted the same structure as had the Provisional Determination: the Defendant&#8217;s general findings on its statutory appellate role had been contained in the first volume of the Final Determination (&#8216;Introductory Chapters&#8217;) and had been relevant to all grounds of appeal, Joint and Individual. That general approach had then been applied in relation to all grounds of appeal (as would be expected), including Cost of Equity and Cost of Debt. The Order had dismissed the Claimant&#8217;s appeal, both in respect of Joint Grounds (save, in limited respects, in relation to Joint Grounds B and C) and Individual Grounds. The Order had been a single regulatory decision, issued to all relevant parties, referring to a single Final Determination (rather than to separate determinations of separate appeals). </p>

The scope of Ground One had been pleaded as being material to the entire Final Determination.

Any relief which declared the Final Determination or Order unlawful, or which quashed the Final Determination or Order on the basis of Ground One, would be applicable to the Joint Grounds, including Cost of Equity, unless the Court were to specify to the contrary. The Claimant had pleaded that the misdirection had infected the entirety of the Final Determination: the proper interpretation of the Defendant&#8217;s statutory role was squarely in issue and the nature of any remedy which might be appropriate if the challenge were to succeed could not be determined summarily at an interlocutory stage;</p>

That was incorrect, for at least two reasons: a declaration as to the correct interpretation of the Defendant&#8217;s statutory role would apply to the Joint Grounds, and, thus, to the Order and Final Determination by which both the Claimant&#8217;s and SSEN-T&#8217;s appeal on those grounds had been dismissed; and, as a matter of principle, it was wrong to suggest that a declaration is an empty remedy.</p>

Not only would its outcome be of considerable importance to the Claimant and to SSEN-T, but it also raised issues of significant complexity and public interest, as had been recognised by Green LJ.  The price controls which flow from final determinations and orders (and the regulatory decisions to which they relate) are said to be the most important regulatory decisions in determining a licensee&#8217;s financial position for a long fixed-term period, in both gas and electricity distribution sectors. A lack of predictability in the legal regime applicable to licence holders would have an adverse impact on investment incentives, which are said to be critical to the success of companies such as the Claimant. There is submitted to be a marked divergence of approach between the Final Determination and the Defendant&#8217;s determinations regarding comparable water price controls, as pleaded by SSEN-T, itself being the only interested party which had sought to participate in the substantive hearing, and it is said that it would run contrary to the Overriding Objective to preclude SSEN-T from advancing its pleaded case, subject to appropriate case management, and given the availability of appropriate costs orders. For essentially the same reasons, the Claimant supports SSEN-T&#8217;s contingent application to be joined as an intervener. </p>

The Defendant&#8217;s grant of permission to appeal to the Claimant, dated 31 March 2021, expressly was conditional upon its joint consideration with specified grounds of appeal (including Cost of Equity) raised in other appeals. Permission in the other appeals was granted on the same basis.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">In any event, as a party to one of the overlapping conjoined appeals affected by the legal framework in accordance with which all appeals were determined, SSEN-T is plainly a party &#8216;directly affected&#8217; by the claim, for the purposes of CPR 54.1(2)(f), for which further reason, no doubt, it and all other appellants were identified by the Defendant in the schedule of those entities which it considered ought to be added as interested parties attached to its Acknowledgement of Service. In now contending to the contrary, the Defendant relies upon <span style="font-style:italic">Muldoon</span>. In that case, which had been concerned with the materially identical requirement of RSC Order 53 rule 5(3), two applicants had sought judicial review of the refusal or failure of the Rent Officer Service and a local authority to determine their respective claims to housing benefit. The Secretary of State for Social Security, who had been required, by primary and secondary legislation, to reimburse up to 95% of a local authority&#8217;s housing benefit qualifying expenditure, had applied to be joined as a respondent to both applications, as a person &#8216;directly affected&#8217; by the decision. That application was dismissed by the High Court, a decision upheld by the Court of Appeal. Dismissing the Secretary of State&#8217;s further appeal, the House of Lords held that, on its true construction, the relevant rule required a notice of motion or summons to be served on someone who would be affected by the judicial review decision without the intervention of any intermediate agency and that, where a local authority was required, pursuant to a decision in judicial review proceedings, to pay housing benefit to an applicant, the Secretary of State's collateral obligation to increase the authority&#8217;s annual housing benefit subsidy accordingly did not amount to an obligation to pay housing benefit to the applicant, either directly or through the agency of the local authority &#8212; whilst he would certainly be affected by the decision, and it might be said that he would inevitably or necessarily be affected, he would only be indirectly affected, by reason of his obligation to pay a subsidy to the local authority.  Accordingly, he could not be joined as a party. A similar approach had been taken by a majority of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Salmon; Priest v Uppleby </span>(1889) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="42 ChD 351" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">42 ChD 351</ref>, in which an issue had arisen as to whether the appellant plaintiff ought to have served certain third parties with the notice of appeal, as being parties &#8216;directly affected&#8217; by it. The Court held that the third parties were only indirectly affected by the plaintiff&#8217;s appeal, by reason of the defendant&#8217;s rights against them through the intervention of the right of indemnity (albeit, I note, going on to hold that the Court ought not to hear the appeal in the absence of the third parties and granting leave to the defendant to serve them with the notice of appeal).</p>

That is to be contrasted with the position in <span style="font-style:italic">Megarry</span>, on which the Defendant and GEMA also rely, in which Turner J dismissed an application under RSC Order 53, made by certain tobacco companies which had sought to be joined to an application for judicial review of the Legal Aid Board&#8217;s decision to refuse the prospective plaintiffs legal aid to pursue claims for personal injury against them. Observing that the statutory regime did not permit those who might become defendants in any proceedings brought as a consequence of the grant of legal aid to make representations at the stage at which the Board decided whether to grant or refuse it, let alone at the stage at which an appeal against its refusal was being considered, Turner J held that there were many possible eventualities before the tobacco companies might become affected by the application for judicial review and that their situation was analogous to that of a third party who might be affected by an appeal to the Court of Appeal, as in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Salmon</span>. Once again, that is not this case, in which the legal framework directly affects SSEN-T&#8217;s own position in the licensing appeal and does not relate to a preliminary stage which might or might not result in its becoming a party to proceedings and at which there is no statutory mechanism through which it may be heard.</p>

In that case, Mencap had challenged reports &#8212; comprising an overview report, together with a separate report relating to each case &#8212; on the outcome of an investigation into complaints by the relatives of six people with learning disabilities who had died following their receipt of allegedly sub-standard care. As originally drafted, the claim had sought relief in the form of an order quashing the reports. Upon the claimant&#8217;s renewed application for permission to apply for judicial review, Pitchford J held that, whilst the report was undoubtedly the vehicle for the claim, the ultimate target of the latter was the treating GPs, albeit that none had been named in the report; and that, should the claim proceed to a hearing, those with the most profound interest in its outcome would be the medical practitioners. As they had not been served as interested parties, and nine months had elapsed since the reports had been published, he refused Mencap permission to apply for judicial review (on that and other grounds). By the time of its appeal from that decision, Mencap had limited the relief sought to a declaration as to the correct approach towards the issue which had given rise to the claim. The Court of Appeal held (at [23] and [24]) that the limited nature of the relief by then sought had cast matters in a different light. There was no longer any attempt to quash the report; rather the claim was being pursued on the basis that it had exposed a legal issue the resolution of which would determine the way in which the ombudsman would approach similar cases in the future, but would not affect the findings in the report itself, which would stand irrespective of the outcome of the claim for judicial review. Any declaration ultimately granted, were the claim to succeed, could be tailored accordingly. In those circumstances, the individual doctors were not interested parties and the issue lay between Mencap and the ombudsman. Others could apply to intervene (indeed, the Equality and Human Rights Commission had applied to do so), but there had been no requirement to identify or serve documents. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">The analogy here is said to lie in SSEN-T&#8217;s acknowledgement that, in the event that the instant claim were to succeed, it would not result in the re-opening of the individual appeal to which it was a party; rather, and at best, it would dictate the Defendant&#8217;s approach to any future appeals. But that is to misconstrue the position, in which, amongst the relief sought by the Claimant, is declaratory relief to the effect that: (a) the Final Determination and associated Order are unlawful; and (b) the Defendant is required to determine appeals adopting the approach variously asserted by the claim. The first of those, at least, is a declaration by which SSEN-T is directly affected in the current proceedings. In any event, I consider the fact that it would also affect the Defendant&#8217;s approach to future statutory appeals, in which SSEN-T would have an interest, to be a relevant consideration here &#8212; as was held to have been the position in <span style="font-style:italic">Telefonica </span>[2] &#8212; and, unlike the position in <span style="font-style:italic">Mencap</span>, that is a matter of ongoing significance to SSEN-T and to the other named interested parties in these proceedings, by which they will be directly affected. By contrast, the medical practitioners&#8217; interest in the ombudsman&#8217;s report in <span style="font-style:italic">Mencap </span>had related specifically to the cases the subject of that report. I do not read the judgment of the Court of Appeal as indicating that, in circumstances such as the present, in which a party will be affected on an ongoing basis by the correct approach to statutory appeals from licence modifications arising from price control decisions, it can never be directly affected by a claim which establishes the correct approach to those decisions, absent a prayer for a relevant quashing order.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">That is consistent with the decision of Silber J in <span style="font-style:italic">McVey</span>. In that case, the Government had established a trust to compensate those who had been affected by variant CJD, of which the Secretary of State was the settlor. At a later stage, a High Court judge had proposed a radical amendment to the operation of the trust, which the Secretary of State had rejected, having taken expert advice, instead making more moderate amendments. The claimants, who were relatives of people suffering from variant CJD, had challenged the failure to have adopted the radical amendment, an application which had been dismissed at an earlier stage. Two interested parties, who suffered from variant CJD and had been treated with a particular drug, sought various declarations as to the conduct or inaction of the defendant, including to the effect that the delay in revising the compensation scheme had been unreasonable; that it had been unreasonable not to have revised it so as to allow for compensation for the cost of gratuitous care by the families of patients who had survived and were receiving experimental treatment; and that it had been irrational to assert that responsibility for compensation for such care should lie with the trust, when it was known that the trustees had no power to offer such compensation. The question was whether the Court had jurisdiction to deal with that claim in light of the fact that it was so removed from the main issue raised in the proceedings. The Court held that there was no jurisdiction, there being no overlap between the remedies sought by the claimants at the main hearing and the relief sought by the interested parties, which did not arise out of the claim since it did not depend upon the claimants&#8217; contention that the radical proposals to amend the trust (which proposals had not included the contention made by the interested parties) ought to have been adopted, but from an asserted free-standing obligation to make the compensation arrangements sought. An interested party was limited to making submissions on the main claim to the extent that he or she was directly affected and would cease to have that status were the claim to be amended such that s/he was no longer directly affected. That is not this case, in which (see below) SSEN-T supports the claim made by the Claimant, in relation to a matter by which it is directly affected, and does not seek to expand the relief claimed. </p>

In that case, Simler J (as she then was) acceded to the defendant&#8217;s application to strike out the claims on the bases that: they were academic because damages were not being sought; declaratory relief would serve no useful purpose where the claimant had, in effect, achieved the relief sought; there would be little or no utility in the Court making findings as to the lawfulness of policies which had since been rescinded, there being no evidence of how many, if any, others had been affected by the issues raised, and nothing to prevent any such individuals from bringing their own challenges; and the claims not being far advanced, procedurally, having been stayed for substantial periods since their issue, being inevitably fact specific, and being publicly funded.

Indeed, as it seems to me, it would be wrong in principle to exclude SSEN-T as an interested party in such circumstances, particularly at this late stage, whilst the other parties to the joined appeals remain as interested parties. Mr Williams KC informed me that a pragmatic decision had been taken to limit the application to SSEN-T as being the only party which had sought to participate and advance additional grounds. First, I do not accept that SSEN-T has done the latter (see below), but, in any event, it is not appropriate to seek to exclude a party on that basis; rather it marks a cynical attempt by the Defendant, supported by GEMA, to restrict the submissions to be made in support of the claim. Furthermore, and as Mr Williams acknowledged in discussion, there would be nothing to prevent the Claimant from adopting the contentions made by SSEN-T in support of its claim, so far as they illustrate the error of principle asserted by Ground One. Following his oral submission of which my note is as follows: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;[The Defendant]&#8217;s position is not that the approach taken would not have made a difference but that [the Claimant] has not identified any respect in which it would have made a difference.

Following the grant of permission to the Claimant, it filed and served detailed grounds for supporting the claim, expressly restricted to Ground One, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;concerning the standard applied by the CMA in determining the appeals&#8217;</span>. As set out earlier in this judgment, by paragraph 5 it pleaded that it sought to illustrate the Claimant&#8217;s contention (with which it agreed) that the Defendant&#8217;s approach had infected the entire Final Determination, by reference to the way in which the Defendant had approached the Cost of Equity ground of appeal. Having pleaded the errors of principle which it contended the Defendant to have made in its Provisional and Final Determinations, from paragraph 37 onwards it set out its reliance upon the Defendant&#8217;s decision concerning the Cost of Equity <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;as providing the clearest illustration of the CMA&#8217;s erroneous approach to its statutory function of determining the appeals brought by the various CMA Appellants&#8217;. </span>It was served with the Claimant&#8217;s Reply to the Defendant&#8217;s Acknowledgement of Service, in accordance with CPR 54.8A(2)(b)(ii). </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">In accordance with CPR 54.14(1), SSEN-T filed and served detailed grounds for supporting the claim on additional grounds; and written evidence. Unlike the immediately following rule, that rule imposes no requirement that an interested party obtain permission to advance additional grounds. The straightforward answer to the Defendant&#8217;s submission that, nevertheless, permission is required is that no such requirement is imposed by the CPR and there is no other source of the asserted obligation, including <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/31/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref>, which provides that no <span style="font-style:italic">application for judicial review</span> shall be made unless the leave of the High Court has been obtained <span style="font-style:italic">in accordance with rules of court </span>(emphasis added), and, thus, advances matters no further. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">Furthermore, the submission seems to me to be wrong, both by reference to the structure of Part 54 and as a matter of principle. CPR 54.14 provides for the filing of detailed grounds 35 days after the grant of permission to the claimant. By definition, additional grounds are those for which permission has not previously been granted, or they would not be additional and would serve no useful function. A further permission stage (on paper and/or at an oral hearing) would operate to delay proceedings. Numerous examples can be found of cases in which, as it appears from the law reports, additional grounds have been advanced by an interested party, and/or where such a party has made the running on the relevant issue, without any need for the prior grant of permission: <span style="font-style:italic">R (British Bankers Association) v FSA</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2011/999" uk:canonical="[2011] EWHC 999 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 999 (Admin)</ref>, at [11]; <span style="font-style:italic">R (MM (Lebanon)) v SSHD </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2017/10" uk:canonical="[2017] UKSC 10" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] UKSC 10</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] 1 WLR 771" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] 1 WLR 771</ref>, at 775F; and <span style="font-style:italic">R (Hampshire County Council) v Environment Secretary </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2021] QB 89" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] QB 89</ref>, at [13], in which the interested party&#8217;s submissions were said to have <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;raised broader, rather more fundamental questions&#8217;</span> than had those of the claimant.

	      </authorialNote>, Kerr J accepted (at [124] to [131]) the Defendant&#8217;s submission that CPR 54 uses the term &#8216;grounds&#8217; in two different senses; one connoting a pleaded ground of challenge, as in CPR 54.5(1)(b) and paragraph 4.2(1)(b) of PD 54A, and the other the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8220;narrow&#8221; sense of reasons for contesting a claim or supporting a defendant&#8217;s resistance to it (as in CPR 54.8(4)(a)(i) and 54.14(1))&#8217;</span>, holding that an interested party required the Court&#8217;s permission to raise a completely new ground, which permission could be given outside CPR Part 54, under the Court&#8217;s CPR Part 3 case management powers. With respect to Kerr J, I do not share his view that the term &#8216;grounds&#8217; in CPR Part 54 is used in two different senses, which appears to me to identify a distinction without a difference, particularly in circumstances in which an interested party seeks to support a claim, and given the juxtaposition of rules CPR 54.14 and 54.15. Furthermore, there is, to my mind, an intrinsic difficulty with adopting different definitions of a recurring term within a suite of rules in the same Part of the CPR and its associated Practice Directions. It may be for that reason that no similar submission was advanced before me. As Ms Carss-Frisk acknowledged, it is necessary to ensure fairness to all parties, including an opportunity for the party or parties affected by additional material to plead (or otherwise respond) to it and to file and serve any associated necessary evidence, but that is a matter for proper case management and is to be distinguished from a requirement for permission.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">But, in any event, consistent with its pleaded case and as emphasised by Ms Carss-Frisk in submissions, in my judgement SSEN-T does not seek to pursue any free-standing additional ground of review, or additional or different relief. Instead, it seeks to illustrate a practical implication of the error asserted by Ground One, following the gauntlet thrown down by the Defendant and GEMA to the effect that the challenge which the Claimant raises is academic (a challenge, I note, which is at odds with Mr Williams&#8217; oral submission, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;We simply do not think that the Court will decide whether or not to grant relief based on examples.&#8217;</span>) In so finding, I do not lose sight of the fact that, within its pleaded criticism of the Defendant&#8217;s approach to Cost of Equity, SSEN-T sets out that which it contends the Defendant ought to have concluded in relation to various aspects of that ground of appeal, had it adopted the correct approach in law, and asserts that the issues identified pervaded both the Provisional and the Final Determination. It may well be that, at the substantive hearing of this claim, the judge will consider it inappropriate and/or unnecessary to reach a concluded view on some or all of those matters, or the underlying detail thereof, in order to determine Ground One. Nevertheless, I do not consider it appropriate, at a preliminary stage, to shut SSEN-T out from advancing its case by way of illustration of the asserted practical effect of the error alleged by Ground One by reference to a ground of appeal which was common to all appeals which were determined by the Defendant, including that brought by the Claimant. To the Defendant&#8217;s and GEMA&#8217;s objection that that is to permit a disproportionate exercise, the answer is straightforward. First, at its highest, it is said that the additional material would add one day (and, on Ms Carss-Frisk&#8217;s estimate, half a day) to a substantive hearing which Green LJ considered to raise issues of general importance and public interest. That does not afford a powerful basis for objection, including when considered in conjunction with any associated additional preparation and steps in this litigation. Secondly, the judge to whom the substantive hearing is assigned will be in a position to impose a strict timetable, at or shortly prior to its outset. Thirdly, if and to the extent that, in the event, that judge considers such time and associated preparatory work to have been disproportionately exhausted by the matters on which SSEN-T relies and/or that those matters have not assisted him or her in determining Ground One, that can be reflected in appropriate costs orders. Of course, if the Defendant and/or GEMA remain of the view that it is unnecessary, in Mr Williams&#8217; language, to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;get into the weeds&#8217;</span>, that will, no doubt, be reflected in the detail with which they consider it necessary and appropriate to respond to SSEN-T&#8217;s Detailed Grounds for Supporting the Claim.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.74in">In short, once it is acknowledged that SSEN-T was properly joined as, and remains, an interested party, and that it would not have required permission to advance additional grounds (had that been the exercise in which it had engaged), the only basis upon which any part of its pleaded case could be struck out would be as an appropriate exercise of the Court&#8217;s case management powers, and, at this stage, in particular given the Defendant&#8217;s and GEMA&#8217;s pleaded contention that Ground One raises an academic issue, I am not satisfied that a proper foundation for taking that Draconian step is made out.</p>
