I will refer to the parties as they are in the tribunal.  The claimant seeks to appeal the reserved decision of Employment Judge Anstis, arising from a hearing on 20 November 2023, refusing an application by her to amend her claim.  The claimant is a litigant in person.  In the EAT she initially drafted her own grounds of appeal.  However, at a preliminary hearing she was represented under the ELAAS scheme by Jeffrey Jupp KC, and draft amended grounds of appeal prepared by him were permitted to proceed to a full appeal hearing in substitution for the original grounds.  </span></p>

The claimant was a police constable serving with the Metropolitan Police from 30 June 2020.  As such, the respondent fell to be treated as her deemed employer for the purposes of her later tribunal complaints.  Following her giving notice in November 2022, her service ended on 31 December 2022.  On 18&#160;February 2023 the claimant began her tribunal claim, which included complaints of disability, race and sex discrimination, including complaints predicated on her having been constructively dismissed.  A response with attached grounds of resistance defending the claims, was put in by solicitors, Gowling WLG (UK) LLP.</span></p>

She sought to add further complaints concerning her alleged treatment during the course of her service and its termination.  She sought also to add a complaint of post-termination victimisation against the respondent.  This related to two emails, concerning the return of her warrant card, sent by Gowling on 11 April and 11 May 2023.  She also sought to have Gowling &#8211; the firm itself &#8211; added as a respondent in connection with that same proposed complaint.</span></p>

The other applications to amend were opposed.</span></p>

In a reserved decision all of them were refused.  This appeal, Ms Leonard confirmed, relates solely to the refusal of the application to add a complaint of post-termination victimisation against the existing respondent.</span></p>

On 22 December she sent a WhatsApp to Sergeant Harrison, with whom she had been in regular contact in recent months, indicating that she had decided not to return to the UK and would mail her warrant card back to London.  Sergeant Harrison was concerned about the security risk of doing that, and indicated that return of the warrant card could await her return to the UK.  However, following further exchanges in the New Year, on 31 January 2023, the claimant offered to send the card by DHL or FedEx.  </span></p>

On 1 March Sergeant Harrison messaged again, checking that the claimant had received that earlier message.  The claimant replied that she had, and that she would confirm when the card had been sent.  On 23 March Sergeant Harrison messaged again, seeking an update, as she herself was being chased again by colleagues.</span></p>

Her warrant card was an important piece of equipment or record, being the written authority she would rely on in exercising her powers as a police officer. It cannot be in dispute that the respondent is entitled to be concerned about the whereabouts of a particular warrant card, given the potential for misuse if it were to fall into the wrong hands. </span></p>

Her service expired shortly after her arrival in Brazil and she agrees that her warrant card needed to be returned to the respondent. She says she has always been willing to return the card but its return was delayed due to delays and mixed messages from the respondent as to the best way to securely return it. Her position is that any allegation of theft is baseless as she had always intended to return the card and been willing to do so. She says the allegations have been very damaging to her. </span></p>

She draws a distinction between the motives of the respondent and its solicitors in sending this. Her amendment is the effect that the respondents &#8220;instructed Gowling to email &#8230; knowing this allegation to be false/fraudulent&#8221;, whereas for Gowling it is (from her agenda) that &#8220;they acted Recklessly on behalf of their client without due regard to the harm such a threat would cause me in my circumstances, having full knowledge of my disabilities at the time it occurred. Intention is not a key element in the claims I wish to bring against them. Recklessness is.&#8221; </span></p>

In principle s108 of the Equality Act permits such a claim. The application to amend was brought within the normal time limit which applied to such a claim. If the claimant had submitted a fresh claim in respect of this the tribunal would have accepted it and the respondent could not object on time grounds. </span></p>

He says that the return of the warrant card was necessary and appropriately dealt with by the respondent. Such a measured approach cannot lead to a detriment. The claimant had, at most, an &#8220;unjustified sense of grievance&#8221;, with there being &#8220;absolutely no evidence that R &#8230; were motivated to write to C in a particular way because C had brought proceedings&#8221;. He says it is an attack on legal professional privilege. </span></p>

If she can prove this then it seems to me that this could amount to victimisation in the conduct of litigation. </span></p>

Although the claimant objects to the approach, it seems to me that it is less extreme than it could have been. The respondent had every right to recover the warrant card and every right to be concerned about its whereabouts. Mention of a &#8220;theft report&#8221; is not quite the same as the outright accusation of theft the claimant took it to be, and does not lend itself to the detailed analysis of the law relating to theft that the claimant has undertaken. How is the claimant going to show (or, more correctly, provide material from which the tribunal could conclude) that this approach was motivated by the claimant having brought legal proceedings, as opposed to a simple desire to recover a warrant card from a former officer? The claimant has put forward no actual comparators, nor is there anything to suggest how any other officer has been treated in these circumstances. </span></p>

In order to succeed the claimant is going to have to show that someone in the respondent instructed Gowling WLG to write to the claimant threatening submission of a theft report, knowing that there had been no question of theft, and she must provide material from which the tribunal could conclude that they did so because she had brought a discrimination claim, not because they wished to recover the warrant card. The application to add this claim is refused because the weak merits of the claim mean that the balance of prejudice in refusing the application favours the respondent rather than the claimant. </span></p>

I do not see how the claimant&#8217;s allegation that they were &#8220;reckless&#8221; can amount to the only allegation that would be within the jurisdiction of the tribunal: that they have committed an act of victimisation. Beyond that, I would be very reluctant to allow an amendment to add in the solicitors as a respondent for the final reason given by Mr Isaacs &#8211; it would involve difficult questions of legal professional privilege and may well require separate representation for the two respondents. This would unnecessarily complicate the conduct of the claim and take away from the core issues, which are the allegations of discrimination that arise during the claimant&#8217;s employment by the respondent.&#8221;</span></p>

First, Soole J did not go so far as to say that when the complaint would, as a freestanding claim, be in time, it is impermissible for the tribunal ever to have regard to the merits short of no reasonable prospect of success as counting against the applicant; although he found it hard to conceive of a case where that aspect could support the refusal of the amendment.

Nevertheless, there may be cases where the tribunal may properly conclude that, because, for example, the application has been made at a very late stage of the existing claim&#8217;s progress to trial, the impact of adding the new complaint to the existing claim would be so disruptive to its efficient and expeditious resolution, that this justifies refusing the amendment application.

However, the tribunal was, at that point, in paragraph [32], discussing how counsel who appeared for the respondent at that hearing put the case for it.  The tribunal&#8217;s response at paragraph [33] was that an honest and reasonable email might well fall within </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Khan</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">, but that it was the claimant&#8217;s case that the respondent&#8217;s actions were &#8220;false/fraudulent&#8221;; and that if she could prove </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">that</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">, then that could amount to victimisation in the conduct of the litigation.

But it would not, I think, be right to say that she would have to secure a finding that the respondent&#8217;s actions were fraudulent, in order to succeed in a complaint that these emails were reasonably perceived as subjecting her to a detriment, nor indeed that they were because of her protected act.  </span></p>

What it does not appear to have considered was the strength of the claimant&#8217;s case that she reasonably found these emails, which, however couched, raised for the first time the possibility of a theft report, to be alarming and distressing.  </span></p>

Again, the legal test is well established.  It is sufficient if a protected act, consciously or unconsciously, materially influenced the conduct in question.

However, it is of concern that the tribunal, at [34], referred to the issue as being whether the conduct that the claimant sought to complain of was motivated by her having brought legal proceedings &#8220;as opposed to&#8221; a simple desire to recover the warrant card.  That tends to suggest that the tribunal approached the matter as giving rise to a binary issue &#8211; that either it was one or it was the other &#8211; rather than considering the merits of the contention that these emails represented an escalation of the respondent&#8217;s efforts to get the warrant card back, which escalation was materially influenced by the claimant having brought her tribunal claim.</span></p>

The first two form a pair.  It is contended that the tribunal failed to have regard, first, to the fact that there had been amicable exchanges in which the claimant had indicated her willingness to return the warrant card and the issue was simply how, practically, that was to be done; and, secondly to the consideration that the emails of 11 April and 11 May 2023 reflected a marked change of tone, by raising, for the first time, the prospect of a theft report.  Ms Leonard argued that the tribunal failed to consider whether, having regard also to the timing of the emails, relative to the presentation of the tribunal claim, this change of tone could be said at least to have called for some explanation from the respondent.  </span></p>

Further, the fact that there had been prior communications about the return of the warrant card could potentially be seen as supporting either side&#8217;s case, having regard, for example, to the claimant&#8217;s unresponsiveness to Sgt Harrison&#8217;s WhatsApp message in late March.  She submitted that the tribunal had specifically considered the tone of the emails at paragraph [27].  She submitted that what weight to attach to these features was a matter for the tribunal, and the EAT could not and should not interfere.</span></p>

On any real world view, it is difficult not to see the raising of the possibility of a theft report in the 11 April email, and the repetition of that scenario in the 11 May email, however carefully worded, as representing an escalation on the part of the respondent.  It seems to me that the real issue at trial, if the amendment were allowed, would not be whether that was an escalation, but </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">why </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">that escalation happened and whether the issuing of the tribunal claim had at least materially influenced it.  </span></p>

But if it was to enter into the delicate territory of weighing the potential merits of the proposed complaint, the tribunal needed to consider and weigh also the claimant&#8217;s case, having regard to the timing and nature of this development, that it had been at least materially influenced by her starting her claim.  The tribunal does not appear to have done so.</span></p>

The definition of victimisation does not require an actual or hypothetical comparator, but the ground does not contend that the tribunal erred by supposing that it did, nor do I take that view.  Rather, it appears to me that the tribunal&#8217;s point was that the claimant was not seeking to rely upon what might be called an evidential comparator, and that, if she had been able to point to one, that would have made her case potentially stronger.  Ms Leonard argued that it was nevertheless wrong to attach weight to the absence of that, when disclosure had yet to take place.  But I do not think it was an error of law, as such, simply to point out the absence of that feature, as matters stood.  </span></p>

Ms Murphy submits that the tribunal plainly would have appreciated that there had been no general disclosure as yet, and plainly there could have been none yet, of any material that might need to be disclosed, relating to these particular post-termination emails if they did become part of the claim by amendment.  The tribunal, she suggested, also alluded to the point about disclosure in the course of [35].  I agree with those points.  However, I consider that this strand of the ground has more force on the point of the tribunal having applied too exacting a legal standard, in particular, for reasons I have already discussed, at [35] in the way that it characterised what would have to be shown by the claimant for the complaint to succeed, or to shift the burden to the respondent to explain this conduct.</span></p>

That is perhaps not surprising, given the relatively early stage in the litigation at which the amendment was being considered, which was, essentially, not much further on than close of pleadings.  Ms Murphy told me that at the same hearing the tribunal did set a trial date, but she understood that that was September 2025.  In all events here is no sign that the present tribunal viewed this as being a destabilising late-stage application.</span></p>
