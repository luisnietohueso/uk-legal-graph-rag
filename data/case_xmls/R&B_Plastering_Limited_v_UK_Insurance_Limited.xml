Its contract manager was Mark Leeks and its site foreman (in effect site manager) for the project in question was Thomas Hayes (TH). The project was the complete refurbishment of a three-story detached house, &#8220;Samphire,&#8221; in Aldeburgh, Suffolk. RNC was the main contractor, and as is usual practice it engaged specialist sub-contractors as required. Specifically, the plastering contract was put out by RNC to tender, and on 13 July 2017 it was awarded to R&amp;B.</span></p>

The flooring was chipboard and when not in use the hole was covered by a number of battens - 2 by 4s across the narrow breadth of the aperture with pieces of chipboard on top. The battens were 200 mm longer than the width of the hole, but importantly, the covering was not fastened in place. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.64in">His task was difficult. Many of the core background facts were in dispute. Such photographs as had been taken after the event raised questions about the nature of the covering to the hole, what if anything had been in place, and how it had failed - if in place- and thus, about the causation of the accident. Two key witnesses did not give oral evidence at trial:  Brian Eckford himself, and Gary Buck, an RNC employee who claimed (in an unsworn statement not made in the proceedings, but which was before the court), to have gone upstairs and spoken with Brian Eckford before the accident &#8211; something which was strongly denied by Brian Eckford as recorded in other written evidence. </p>

Above, looking up through the hole, and on the floor nearby, is a stack of wood, possibly the planks or battens, under which another piece -possibly - of flooring chipboard may be seen. There was an issue at trial as to when the stack of wood seen had been placed there.

The chipboard covering had fallen with him and was found next to him on his fall. The case for the insurers in essence was that it was more likely than not that Brian Eckford had tampered with the slats and chipboard covering, otherwise it was safe at all material times, and R&amp;B could not prove anything different.</p>

He recited the relevant parts of the regulatory framework covering working at heights and risk assessment, imposing duties on employers and self-employed workers. As he stated, in broad terms the relationships were familiar on any building site and reflected that RNC had emphasised that it was not Brian Eckford&#8217;s employer and that R &amp;B stood between them as either de facto employer or, at least, in control of Brian Eckford&#8217;s work.</p>

Thomas Hayes was surprised by this unusual idea and tried to see if there was a better alternative. There was not. Therefore, Thomas Hayes instructed his carpenter to cut the hole. RNC, as the judge found,  did not take specific steps about covering the hole when  not in use;  he held on the balance of probabilities,  that R&amp;B&#8217;s workmen improvised the covering with battens and chipboard from materials to hand. The judge noted that Thomas Hayes saw the covering in place more than once on the day before, that is on 26 July, and took no action in respect of it.</p>

The judge was entirely alive to the difficulty of it being shown more likely than not that one particular scenario or another had taken place.

RNC relied on the unsworn written statement of Gary Buck which said he&#8217;d gone upstairs and cleared up and was checking around and saw Brian Eckford plaster - boarding the end gable who had then said to him be careful of the hole and at that time (before the accident)  the hole had been covered up with timber slats and the piece of chipboard were on top. No more precise timing was given.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.64in">The judge did not accept that case. He determined that RNC owed Brian Eckford a duty of care as occupiers of the site.  They were in breach of it by failing to take reasonable care with respect to the covering of the hole in that they gave no thought to it or to the ability of R &amp;B (who actually made the cover) to do so.  Similarly, they owed a duty to him to reinstate the floor <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the accident happened.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.75in">The judge also held there was a negligence duty in these circumstances because of the special features of the joint nature of the decision to give access by cutting the hole, and RNC&#8217;s active participation was &#8220;indispensable&#8221;. Further, only RNC was in a position to make Brian Eckford safe by promptly reinstating the floor: he himself had met with Thomas Hayes, and it was clearly foreseeable that he particularly was the person at most risk; (paragraph [6]). For this reason he found little difference between RNC and R&amp;B&#8217;s proximity and control. He concluded that both R&amp;B and RNC owed Brian Eckford a duty of care during their &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">ill-considered joint activity</span>&#8221; which had exposed him to unacceptable risks.  The breaches were a failure to carry out a proper RAMS, failing to ensure that the temporary covering was safe and robust, and failing to reinstate the floor as soon as practicable &#8211; which time was before the accident.</p>

(Munkman, op. cit. at 7.33). In this case there is something of an overlap, because the dangerous  condition of the premises was specifically created as part of a joint decision in order to facilitate the  temporary conduct of an activity. However, as indicated at 5.3 above</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">, the crucial omission in this case, but for which the accident would not have occurred, was the failure to reinstate the flooring sooner, (or at least to prevent BE from working in that room until the reinstatement had been completed).</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">As  between RNC and R&amp;B, RNC was the only party either entitled to effect changes to the structure of the building or in a practical position to do so; and this was because for these purposes it was in effective occupation as the main contractor.

The hole had been created by R&amp;B but since RNC gave no consideration to it or to R&amp;B&#8217;s ability to make it,  RNC&#8217;s duty of reasonable care had not been discharged &#8211; this was aside from their responsibility for reinstating the floor. </p>

Further it appeared that at the time of the accident the covering was not resting on the battens which ought to have been apparent to Brian Eckford. The photographs did not contain pictures of battens but there was a piece of board which was broken suggesting that it may have been across the hole alone. Other deductions invited by the parties were rejected as speculation and inherently improbable. A contribution as to a 20% was assessed. </p>

It was also submitted (and not opposed) that a benign approach should be taken to evidence from a claimant who is impaired by reason of the accident in question. In this case Brian Eckford&#8217;s memory was said to be unreliable following the accident, however he had said (as recorded in his solicitor&#8217;s Attendance Note) that the evidence of Mr Buck that he had seen the hole covered 20 minutes before the accident occurred was entirely wrong, indeed it was a fabrication.  He was clear he was up there on his own that morning.</p>

The judge was in the circumstances of this case fully entitled to refer to the photographs for his conclusion that it was more likely than not the battens were not in place when Brian Eckford fell. As the Respondent to this appeal submits, it is notable that Gary Buck did not make any statement in the proceedings, was not called to give evidence and reliance was placed only on his very short unsworn statement to the HSE on behalf of his employers, whose case it supported, and which could not be tested in cross-examination. </p>

Brian Eckford said nothing was secured, he also said, there were just some bearers and a little piece of wood that had been cut out to cover it.  The judge however, approached the case at the level of breach of duty. He analysed the position in law (entirely correctly in my judgement), of the two concerned contractors, concluding the environment created by them constituted an unsafe system of work for a lone worker such as Brian Eckford in the particular conditions as  he reasonably found them to be, of the site at the time.</p>

Indeed in paragraph 7.3 the judge held it was inherently improbable that Brian Eckford, a man of 70 and many years experience, would have moved the battens himself or deliberately walked on the covering. It was more likely that he had tripped or inadvertently mis-stepped.  Given the  nature of the working space and the state of the unsecured covering to the hole, that was sufficient to have precipitated the fall. These deductions were, on the evidence, entirely sustainable.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.64in">I reject these arguments. The judge was faced, as I have said, with two important witnesses providing evidence only on paper: from Gary Buck a handwritten piece of paper apparently signed by him on 27 July 2017,<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13.5pt;color:#000000"> </span><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:#000000">saying  </span>&#8220;Board was over hole-flooring material used timber was underneath flooring material&#8221; and another a few days later,  more formal but unsworn, to the HSE, whilst from Mr Eckford there was a statement recorded by his solicitor, in response to the point. The judge concluded, as he was fully entitled on the evidence to do, that the temporary covering of the hole, was as submitted by R&amp;B, acceptable as a very short-term temporary measure whilst the operation of moving the plaster boards was in train, thereafter, the balance changed and it became a dangerous trap. Having read the evidence of the small space, the numerous plaster boards, the fact the hole could not be seen from various parts including from the door, the conclusions of the judge are completely understandable. It is trite that a judge is not obliged to rehearse the whole of the evidence: the judgement provides clear sustainable reasoning and his conclusions are similarly logically sustainable, as well, it might be said,  as a matter of common sense.  It is not irrelevant that in the HSE prosecution the parties pleaded to the allegations of breaches of duty.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.64in">It was further argued in the Appellant&#8217;s skeleton argument that there was a material distinction between the culpability of RNC and R&amp;B. R&amp;B directed and controlled Brian Eckford&#8217;s work and they had a duty to devise a safe system of work. They should have notified RNC that there was an urgent need to reinstate. The omissions that were attributed to RNC were &#8220;nowhere near as significant&#8221; as those of the other firm. I reject this analysis, for the reasons given by the judge, including that the only people with the right to alter the site were RNC who were in charge of it. The finding of equality of blame is described as &#8220;entirely erroneous&#8221; and a figure of that 75% ought to fall upon R&amp;B. I disagree. The idea that some particularly risky manoeuvre had been carried out by Brian Eckford was mere speculation. The contributory negligence factor he held should be 20%. I have no basis for interfering with that attribution. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.64in">The judge carefully analysed the facts, but he also went further. He had regard to the part 36 settlement and the Opinion of Brian Eckford&#8217;s counsel in the context of that offer. It had been in terms of one third contributory negligence and Counsel&#8217;s preliminary view had been at he would be found at least 15% and possibly was at risk of 25% at contributory negligence. R&amp;B&#8217;s solicitor had come to the figure of 20%, similarly. Such calculations as had been carried out before negotiating the settlement were consonant with the judge&#8217;s view, on the basis of the same body of evidence. There is no reason to disturb the judge&#8217;s calculation. It is important to remember the central finding of his judgment was that the situation ought never to have been allowed to come about and the fact that it had, represented a breach of duty on the part of both R &amp;B and RNC. </p>

		      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.64in;text-indent:0.36in"><span style="font-style:italic">In the absence of any specific guidance on this point, I approach it from first principles. The 1978 Act does not expressly state that the contribution shall be a proportion of any &#8220;damages&#8221; paid. Rather, its starting point is that the contributor shall be a person &#8220;liable in respect of the same damage&#8221;, and that (in this case) a person who has &#8220;made or agreed to make any payment in bona fide settlement or compromise of any claim made against him in respect of any damage&#8230;shall be entitled to recover contribution in accordance with this section&#8230;&#8221;. If this or the other preconditions in s.1 are met the right to contribution arises. The amount of contribution is as provided by s.2; it is &#8220;such as may be found to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person&#8217;s responsibility for the damage in question.&#8221; This would include, but not be limited to, damages strictly so called; it would or might include a contribution to costs, for example.</span></p>

In my view, it is a proper exercise of the jurisdiction under s.2 for me to conclude that it is just and equitable for the present Defendant insurer to share those expenses equally with the present Claimant&#8217;s insurer by way of contribution. Any other approach would have a regrettable tendency to discourage participation in this valuable scheme, and to encourage insurers to game the system in the hope of leaving the expense with another insurer.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.64in"> I entirely agree that the entitlement to a contribution arises if the conditions of section 1 are met. Those conditions include that the potential contributor is liable for the same damage in respect of which [in this case] a settlement was entered. The condition is met in this case. It is not that the contribution is required to be a proportion of any &#8220;damages&#8221; as such that is paid.</p>
