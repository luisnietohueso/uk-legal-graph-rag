      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">SAFEGUARDING VULNERABLE GROUPS (65) </span></p>
      <p>The appellant was included by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) on the children&#8217;s and adults&#8217; barred lists because DBS concluded that she had verbally, emotionally and physically abused a vulnerable adult for whom she was caring as a live-in carer. The Upper Tribunal allows her appeal and remits her case to DBS for a fresh decision because the decision was materially unfair as a result of DBS having failed to give her an effective opportunity to make representations on the decision. The Upper Tribunal decides that:</p>
      <blockContainer>
	<num>(i)</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.39in">An error of law must be a material error to constitute a mistake for the purposes of section 4(2) of the Safeguarding of Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 (SVGA 2006);</p>
      </blockContainer>
      <blockContainer>
	<num>(ii)</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.11in">A procedural error will be a material error of law if it might make a material difference to the outcome or the fairness of the decision;</p>
      </blockContainer>
      <blockContainer>
	<num>(iii)</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.23in">As a public authority decision-maker, DBS is required to act fairly. Fairness in a particular case may require DBS to do more than simply comply with the letter of the SVGA 2006. In particular, fairness requires that a person be given an effective opportunity to make representations, not just &#8220;the&#8221; opportunity as required by paragraph 16(1) of Schedule 3 to the SVGA 2006;</p>
      </blockContainer>
      <blockContainer>
	<num>(iv)</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.11in">Paragraph 16(1) requires that the individual be given an opportunity to make representations on &#8220;all the information on which DBS intends to rely&#8221;. This is an obligation to provide access to information, which may be complied with by offering to make arrangements to view evidence (such as video evidence in this case). It is not an obligation to disclose documents, but in most cases (including this one) it will require DBS to provide all the documents it has received on the case, not just a summary of that information in a letter. Even if DBS is not itself &#8216;relying&#8217; on some of those documents, fairness may require that they be provided;</p>
      </blockContainer>
      <blockContainer>
	<num>(v)</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.39in">A failure by DBS to give someone an effective opportunity to make representations will normally make a material difference to the fairness of the decision because: (a) the right to make representations is fundamental to natural justice; and (b) a failure to afford such opportunity deprives the individual of the opportunity of having DBS fairly consider whether it is appropriate for them to be included in a barred list &#8211; a question in respect of which no right of appeal lies to the Upper Tribunal (s 4(3) SVGA 2006); </p>

	<num>(vi)</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.11in">A procedural failure may cease to be material if DBS considers late representations or carries out a review and issues a new decision, or if the individual is successful in an appeal to the Upper Tribunal on another ground (whether of law or fact);</p>
      </blockContainer>
      <blockContainer>
	<num>(vii)</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.23in">DBS has discretion in all cases to extend the prescribed 8-week period for making representations where there is &#8220;good reason&#8221; to do so: regulation 2(6) of The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 (Barring Procedure) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/474) (the 2008 Regulations)). In this case, DBS had failed lawfully to exercise that discretion. The Upper Tribunal gives guidance on the factors relevant to the exercise of that discretion;</p>

	<num>(viii)</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.36in">After a decision has been made, DBS has an open discretion to give permission for late representations to be made and considered under paragraph 17(2) of Schedule 3 to the SVGA. The requirements of natural justice, the Human Rights Act 1998 and public policy factors, mean that, in most cases, DBS should give permission for late representations to be made even where there is no reason why representations were not made earlier. In this case, DBS had failed lawfully to exercise its discretion.</p>

It is unfortunate that it has taken so long for her appeal to be determined and we offer our apologies to her for the Upper Tribunal&#8217;s part in the delay. However, it is not just Upper Tribunal administration that has delayed the appellant&#8217;s appeal, and as the history of this appeal before the Upper Tribunal has some bearing on the decision we have ultimately reached in this case, we need to set it out here.</span></p>

DBS refused in part and by letter of 9 May 2022 sought an order prohibiting the CCTV footage from being sent to the appellant because of concerns about the risks of such footage being copied and coming into the public domain. DBS suggested that the appellant should be provided with an opportunity to view the footage at the Upper Tribunal prior to any hearing. By directions of 14 June 2022, Judge Rowley indicated that it was her preliminary view that DBS should provide the CCTV footage to the appellant, subject to the usual requirements that the appellant use it only for the purposes of these proceedings.</span></p>

That may be how the statute works in relation to decisions made by DBS under paragraphs 2 and 8 of Schedule 3 by virtue of the apparently strict provision of paragraphs 2(5) and 8(5), but there is no similar provision in paragraphs 3 and 9. </p>

It is thus also arguable that a decision to include a person on a barred list without having given them a reasonable opportunity to make representations as required would be a decision reached in error of law as being materially unfair. </p>

However, normally, if there is an arguable error of law in a decision, permission would be granted unless the error was not arguably material. It may well be that any procedural error in this case is unlikely ultimately to make a difference to whether DBS decides to place the appellant on the barred list. However, the question of whether it is appropriate for the appellant to be included on the barred list is for the DBS, not this Tribunal, and at the permission stage (prior to a substantive response by DBS to the appeal) it does not seem to me to be right to assume what DBS&#8217;s approach will be to the appellant&#8217;s representations if, as and when she is permitted to make them and they are considered by DBS. </p>

Reasons are important in this context for individuals who may struggle to understand how a dismissal from one job can lead to barring from their whole field of work and chosen career. It is arguable in this context that permitting the appellant to make representations and then giving of reasons for rejecting them (if that is the DBS&#8217;s decision) would itself amount to a material difference in outcome for this appellant.</p>

Given the legislative hurdles that an appellant who has been included on a list has to surmount in order to get removed from a list, it may be thought to be particularly important that procedural fairness is observed at the outset and before DBS has made its decision to include the individual on a list (which decision it is thereafter in the position of defending with all the implications that has for confirmation bias in decision-making processes). </p>

The appellant&#8217;s age and its implications for her ability to secure alternative employment appear to me to be obviously relevant factors to take into account in assessing whether it is proportionate in a particular case, given the nature of the risk posed by the individual, to place an individual on a barred list. However, I have reviewed DBS&#8217;s decision letter and cannot find any reference to these matters. As such, I consider that it is arguable that DBS has erred in law by failing to take into account a relevant factor in its decision-making process and/or arguable that the decision to bar was in error of law as breaching DBS&#8217;s obligation as a public authority under s 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 to act compatibly with the appellant&#8217;s Convention rights.</p>

In this case, the only reasoning in DBS&#8217;s decision letter addressing that condition is &#8220;you have previously applied for the role of Child and Adult Workforce Healthcare Assistant with United Kingdom Home Care Association Ltd&#8221;. At this hearing, the appellant confirmed she had made that application. However, an application is not evidence that the appellant &#8220;is or has been&#8221; engaged in regulated activity with children. Nor is it, without more, evidence that the appellant &#8220;might in future be&#8221; engaged in such activity. DBS&#8217;s decision letter contains no reasons at all explaining why DBS concluded that the condition in paragraph 3(3)(a) was satisfied. As such, it is arguable that DBS erred in law either by concluding that condition was satisfied or in failing to give adequate reasons for this part of its decision.</p>

This set out the appellant&#8217;s evidence regarding the alleged procedural errors in DBS&#8217;s decision-making, including her evidence as to what documents she had received from DBS at the time the decision was taken and her requests for extensions of time to make representations and/or to make late representations.

Judge Stout explained that, if DBS was right in its argument, then unless she put in a witness statement &#8220;setting out her factual challenges to DBS&#8217;s decision, her appeal may be unsuccessful&#8221;, but added &#8220;It is a matter for the appellant whether she wishes to take that risk or not&#8221;.</p>

Judge Stout reminded both parties of the needs for statements of other witnesses on whom they wished to rely to be sent to the Tribunal and the other party at least 21 days before the hearing.

The documentation from FOH indicates that the appellant&#8217;s position during the disciplinary process was that she accepted she had behaved as alleged, but argued that she had been provoked by VA. We note that she did not offer this explanation in her statement of 27 July 2020, but in the subsequent investigation and disciplinary meetings she alleged that VA had subjected her to serious verbal racial abuse.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The appellant was questioned at length at this hearing about whether or not and when she had received Annex A. Although the appellant at times appeared to become confused about the chronology (understandably so, given the passage of time), she seemed to us to have a firm recollection of not having the documents when she went to see the legal advisor, but having been sent them for the first time after she had asked for them in the letter of 3 August 2021. This was surprising to the panel because if she had been sent what was (so far as DBS is concerned) a &#8216;second&#8217; copy of Annex A, we would have expected to see that mentioned in the documents that were before us. As it was, neither the appellant or DBS had mentioned it before the hearing. As such, we as a panel had provisionally formed the view during her oral evidence that the appellant was just confused about when she received the documents, but in closing submissions counsel for DBS then said that in fact he had checked and it was accepted by DBS (contrary to the impression given by some of his questions to the appellant during oral evidence) that DBS </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Arial">had</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> sent out a &#8216;second&#8217; copy of Annex A when the appellant asked for the documents. This led the panel to re-evaluate the appellant&#8217;s evidence on this point, which now appeared to be reliable. This, together with the documentary evidence of what the appellant wrote and said to DBS at the time, leads us to accept that (whether or not DBS sent Annex A with the Minded to Bar letter on 7 June 2021), the appellant herself did not knowingly receive either the letter or Annex A at that time, but saw the letter for the first time on 30 July 2021 and Annex A for the first time when it was sent by DBS sometime after her letter of 3 August 2021.</span></p>

This may at first seem to be an issue of purely academic interest, but unfortunately the scheme of the SVGA 2006 gives it a practical importance because, under section 4(6), if the Upper Tribunal finds that DBS has a made &#8220;such a mistake&#8221; (i.e. a mistake of law or fact as identified in section 4(2)), it <span style="font-weight:bold">must</span> either direct DBS to remove the person from the list or remit the matter to DBS for a new decision.

DBS submits that the use of the word &#8220;mistake&#8221; does the work that is done in judicial review proceedings by what are now the &#8220;no substantial difference&#8221; provisions in section 31(3C), (3D) and (2A) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (and what was previously a &#8216;common law&#8217; discretion for the High Court to refuse relief in such cases).

This is because sections 4(5) and (6) give the Upper Tribunal such a limited discretion once a mistake of law or fact has been identified and require an appeal to be &#8216;allowed&#8217; at that point, with the matter either being remitted to DBS for a fresh decision or the person either being removed from the list (if that is the only decision DBS could have made: <span style="font-style:italic">DBS v AB </span>[2021] EWCA Civ 1575, [2022] 1 WLR 1002 at [73] <span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Lewis LJ).

We are not troubled by the fact that that interpretation renders redundant the additional words included in section 4(2)(b) for mistakes of fact that the mistake must be in the facts &#8220;on which the decision mentioned in that sub-section was based&#8221;. Although, as a general rule, an interpretation that results in redundant wording is to be avoided, in this case we consider that general rule needs to give way because the drafting of the section of the whole points so strongly towards the drafter having regarded a mistake on a point of law as necessarily being a material error of law that should result in an appeal being &#8216;allowed&#8217;. The policy arguments all point in favour of that interpretation too as otherwise appeals would need to be &#8216;allowed&#8217; in order to enable DBS to deal with purely academic points, which would not appear to be in anyone&#8217;s interests.</p>

However, part of its reasoning for so concluding was (at [103]) that &#8220;the Upper Tribunal can put right any errors of law and any material errors of fact and, further, can do so at an oral hearing if that is necessary for the fair and just disposition of the appeal&#8221;. After being referred to this passage by counsel for DBS, we suggested that, in deciding whether a procedural error amounts to a mistake on a point of law for the purposes of section 4(2)(a), it might be relevant to consider whether the error was one that was capable of being remedied through the appeal process or not.

We observe that the question of whether or not it is &#8220;appropriate&#8221; to bar someone will in many cases be a question that is susceptible of being rationally and lawfully answered either &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; by DBS on the same facts. In other words, a different decision-maker at DBS might reach a different decision in a particular case without there being any error in the decision that could be successfully challenged as a mistake of law on appeal to the Upper Tribunal. Equally, relatively minor factual details, perhaps of context or presentation, of the sort that would be unlikely to be regarded as a mistake of fact on appeal may nonetheless lead a DBS decision-maker to make a different decision on whether it is appropriate to bar.</p>

Fairness in this context will normally mean a decision that complies with the two main pillars of natural justice, i.e. a decision that is, at least: (i) free from bias; and, (ii) taken after having given the appellant an effective opportunity to make representations.</p>

We proceed for the purposes of this appeal on the assumptions that: (i) DBS sent the Minded to Bar letter by post to the appellant on 7 June 2021 as required by regulation 2(2) and (3); (ii) it was deemed received by the appellant 48 hours later by virtue of regulation 2(4); and, (iii) the 8-week period for making representations under regulation 2(5) therefore really did expire on 4 August 2021. </span></p>

The appellant has not sought to argue on this appeal that she has &#8220;proved&#8221; that she did not &#8216;receive&#8217; the Minded to Bar letter within 48 hours of it being &#8220;sent&#8221; for the purposes of regulation 2. We consider it likely that what regulation 2(4) means by &#8216;proving&#8217; an alternative date of &#8216;receipt&#8217; means merely &#8216;proving&#8217; that the notice was actually received at the individual&#8217;s address on a different date. We doubt it is sufficient for someone to prove that that they personally did not open or read notice as such an interpretation could seriously undermine the scheme under the Act by allowing an individual to dictate when the prescribed 8-week period ends (and thus delaying the point at which DBS may make a decision in their case) by (for example) not collecting their post for a period.

It is pursuant to these provisions that employers and other regulated activity providers are required to provide &#8220;information&#8221; to DBS to enable it to make barring decisions. What is meant by &#8220;information&#8221; in paragraph 16 therefore has to be understood in this context. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">While it might in principle be possible for DBS to comply with paragraph 16 by setting out in the Minded to Bar letter every piece of &#8220;information&#8221; that it has obtained from the regulated activity provider and on which it intends to rely in its decision, in most cases it seems to us that it will be difficult for DBS to comply with paragraph 16 by doing that. In practice, paragraph 16(1) will usually require DBS to provide the individual with an opportunity of making representations about &#8220;all&#8221; the &#8220;information&#8221; (in whatever form) that it has received from the regulated activity provider and on which it &#8220;relies&#8221; when setting out the reasons for its provisional decision in the Minded to Bar letter. This is because, generally speaking, the material that DBS includes in the Minded to Bar letter itself is in some sense a summary or otherwise incomplete representation of what is in the &#8220;information&#8221; provided to DBS by the regulated activity provider. For example, DBS may in the Minded to Bar letter describe what happened on a particular day. DBS&#8217;s account will be taken from a witness statement. DBS will in its decision in truth be relying on the whole of that statement, including the &#8220;information&#8221; the document contains about who wrote it, whether they typed it or wrote it by hand and how they expressed themselves. All of that will usually have contributed to DBS&#8217;s decision by making the evidence more or less plausible and will therefore form part of the information on which DBS is relying in making its decision, although not all of that contextual information will be captured in the Minded to Bar letter itself.</p>

It is also consistent with the approach that DBS took in this case of offering the appellant an opportunity to make arrangements to view the CCTV footage or receive an independent transcript thereof. Paragraph 16(1) only requires the individual to have an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to make representations in relation to &#8220;all of the information&#8221;, which we accept can be achieved by the opportunity to make arrangements to view video or listen to audio evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, we further observe that paragraph 16 only takes us so far in terms of understanding what DBS needs to provide to a person whom it is minded to bar. That is because DBS is, like any public authority decision-maker, under a duty to act fairly. Fairness may require DBS in some cases to provide to an individual more than paragraph 16 requires. It may in some cases require DBS to provide information to an individual that it has in its possession but on which it is not &#8216;relying&#8217;. If that information is relevant to the case, fairness may require it to be disclosed in the same way that the duty of standard disclosure in the civil courts requires parties to disclose not only documents on which they rely, but also documents which adversely affect their case or the other party&#8217;s case or support the other party&#8217;s case. Likewise, on a similar basis, &#8220;unused material&#8221; will normally be disclosed to the defence in criminal proceedings, while in public law proceedings the duty of candour (or, simply, the overriding objective) may require a public body to provide disclosure of material other than the material on which it relies. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">We add also that, as noted when setting out the Legal Framework above, what fairness normally requires is that a person who may be affected by a decision should have not just &#8220;an&#8221; opportunity but a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; or &#8220;effective&#8221; opportunity of making representations about a decision that will affect them. In some cases, we accept, the right to make representations may need to be limited in some way in pursuit of another public interest, such as national security or protection of others. Under the SVGA 2006, paragraph 16(2) of Schedule 3 makes clear that DBS is not required before making a decision to give a person an opportunity to make representations if DBS does not know and cannot reasonably ascertain the whereabouts of the person. That is evidently because the protection of children and vulnerable adults is regarded by Parliament as more important than the individual&#8217;s procedural right to make representations before a decision is made. If DBS <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">does</span> know where an individual is, however, then in our judgment paragraph 16(1) and ordinary procedural fairness together require that the individual be given a <span style="font-style:italic">reasonable</span> opportunity of making representations on the information on which DBS relies <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> DBS makes a decision on their case.</p>

It is not enough, therefore, for DBS just to send the information and hope it reaches the person; there is no &#8216;deemed receipt&#8217; provision such as that in regulation 2 of the 2008 Regulations that we have considered above; if the information does not reach the individual, they will not have had the opportunity required by paragraph 16 (and natural justice) to make representations. That is where the discretion in regulation 2(5) of the 2008 Regulations to extend time for making representations where there is &#8220;good reason&#8221; to do so comes in; likewise, the discretion in paragraph 17(2)(b) for DBS to give permission to a person to make late representations. The fact that a person has not received information they require in order to have an effective opportunity to make representations is likely in most cases to constitute a &#8220;good reason&#8221; for DBS to extend time for making representations, or permit late representations.

These were required in order for her to have an effective opportunity to make representations. In particular, the statements from VA&#8217;s daughter and the &#8220;whistleblower statement&#8221; in the bundle in our judgment contain the sort of contextual information that the appellant fairly required in order to have an effective opportunity to make representations. The appellant did not receive Annex A until after the expiry of the prescribed period for making representations on 4 August 2021, and only had four days from actual receipt of the Minded to Bar letter on 30 July 2021 to make arrangements to view the CCTV evidence, but no arrangements were offered by DBS despite the appellant contacting DBS by phone during that period to ask for more time.</p>

In its skeleton argument for this hearing, DBS argued that it did not have power to extend the prescribed period for making representations, but during the course of oral argument DBS recanted from this position, accepting that it did have discretion under regulation 2(6) of the 2008 Regulations.

There is nothing on the face of the legislation to suggest that the discretion is limited to applications made within the prescribed period, although the reference to an extension of time being available only where a person has &#8220;not completed&#8221; making his representations within the period provided for does suggest that the person needs at least to have &#8216;started&#8217; making representations within the period. In this case, however, there was (by the end of the hearing before us) no dispute that the discretion to extend time could in principle have applied in the appellant&#8217;s case, given that she telephoned DBS and wrote the letter of 3 August 2021 within the period (although it arrived after the expiry of the period).</span></p>

Indeed, in auto-barring with representations cases under paragraphs 2 and 8 of Schedule 3, as we have noted above, there is a mandatory duty on DBS to put someone on the list if they do not make representations within the prescribed period. Although the time prescribed for representations will include any extension of time granted under regulation 2(6), the existence of that mandatory duty in paragraphs 2 and 8 cases points towards it being less likely in such cases that an extension of time will be granted. In contrast, there is no such mandatory duty in paragraphs 3 and 9 cases such as the present.

If DBS considers a person&#8217;s representations (however late) and then either makes a &#8216;better&#8217; decision that the person no longer wishes to challenge by way of appeal, or in respect of which the Upper Tribunal is able to dismiss any appeal at the permission stage, that is in everybody&#8217;s interests. </span></p>

The fact that someone had an opportunity to submit representations at the time does not render DBS &#8220;unable&#8221; to grant permission for late representations under paragraph 17(2). Indeed, as we have explained above, the circumstances in which it will be appropriate for DBS to refuse to consider late representations are likely to be very rare. Even if there is no reason why the person could not have made submissions during the prescribed period, if they did not do so, there are, as we have explained above, strong public policy reasons for DBS considering late representations. If DBS refuses to grant permission for late representations without considering any of those public policy factors we have identified, its refusal will generally be irrational and unlawful. In this case, it certainly was, because DBS did not take into account any factors at all other than its belief (largely mistaken on the facts that we have found them to be) that the appellant had had an opportunity to make representations during the prescribed period. </span></p>

As we have explained above, fairness requires not just that someone have &#8216;an&#8217; opportunity, but they have an effective opportunity.

For the reasons set out above in the Factual Background, we concluded that (whether or not the note about Track and Trace is correct), the Minded to Bar Letter and Annex A did not in fact come to the appellant&#8217;s personal attention at that point. We further observe, though, that if the DBS decision-maker(s) were relying on the information from Royal Mail Track and Trace to refuse the appellant&#8217;s applications for an extension of time, fairness required them to tell her.

However, that has not happened and given that DBS had twice refused to consider the appellant&#8217;s representations, we find it understandable that the appellant did not see any point in seeking a review, especially given that her letter of 7 October 2021 requesting a review was responded to with an information leaflet about how to request a review which (correctly, but perhaps somewhat forbiddingly for someone in the appellant&#8217;s position) presents the grounds for review as being limited to cases where &#8220;certain statutory conditions&#8221; are met.</span></p>

Because the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is not a full merits-based appeal, the failure to allow someone an effective opportunity to make representations is the sort of procedural error that is capable of making a material difference to the fairness of the decision, and thus constituting a mistake of law, even if it cannot be shown that the substantive outcome would have been any different.

Having heard the appellant at this hearing, it seemed to us that she has not yet articulated in any document what her representations would have been if she had been permitted to make them. From the point that the Minded to Bar Letter first came to her attention on 30 July 2021, without the accompanying Annex A, she has focused on what we have now held to be the injustice of not being provided with Annex A, and on the injustice of having her applications to make representations refused, and also on the fact that she was not provided with the CCTV evidence (her impression that she had not been given access to this with the Minded to Bar letter being compounded by DBS having tried to prevent her being provided with the CCTV evidence as part of this appeal). </span></p>

We have in mind, for example, what she said about the &#8216;Shouting&#8217; video showing her being interrupted on a break and called back down to help when the other carer (sitting on the sofa in the video) should have been helping, and also her acknowledgment that her conduct was inappropriate and what she said about the impact on her of the decision.</span></p>

The particular factors as to the appellant&#8217;s age, employment history and career prospects that Judge Stout at the permission stage considered it arguable DBS had left out of account, we are now satisfied were not left out of account. These factors are dealt with in the Barring Decision Process Document, and we accept DBS&#8217;s submission that these matters were not left out of account.

Applying <span style="font-style:italic">KS</span>, we are satisfied that the objective of protecting children and vulnerable adults is sufficiently important to justify limiting the appellant&#8217;s fundamental rights, and that the barring decision in this case is rationally connected to the objective. We are satisfied that the appellant poses some risk to vulnerable adults and children, based on the appellant&#8217;s conduct on the &#8220;Shouting&#8221; video, which shows a loss of temper, and verbal and emotional abuse directed towards the VA, sustained over some minutes, coupled with some physical aggression in knocking the door into the chair. We respect DBS&#8217;s view that this conduct is sufficient to justify barring. We accept that there is no less intrusive measure that could have been used without unacceptably compromising achievement of the objective as no other measure would prevent the appellant from being employed in any context with children or vulnerable adults. We agree with DBS that, on the evidence as it stood at the date of DBS&#8217;s decision, her age, past employment history and impact on her of the decision are not sufficient to outweigh the public interest in the protection of vulnerable children and adults. The position may now be different, but on the basis of the circumstances as they were at the time of the decision, it was not unlawful.</p>

However, as a panel we are satisfied that this was not irrational. The legislation requires only that the appellant &#8220;might&#8221; in future work with children; that requires only a realistic possibility, not anything more than that. If somebody has applied for one role that included the word &#8220;Child&#8221; in the title, it is not irrational to conclude that they may in future apply for others and that accordingly they might in future work with children.</span></p>

That DBS needs to consider the circumstances by reference to the time at which it takes a decision is underscored by paragraph 17(4) of Schedule 3, which makes clear that late representations may relate to what has happened since the appellant was included in the lists. This may be important in this case because there has been a very substantial delay in the appellant&#8217;s case reaching a final hearing so that she has in fact now been on the barred lists for 4.5 years.

However, we reach this conclusion on the assumption that DBS will proceed swiftly to make a new decision.
