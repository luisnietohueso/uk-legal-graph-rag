The Embassy has no legal identity separate from that of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Mrs Antoinette Costantine (&#8220;the respondent&#8221;) is a former employee of the Embassy.

From 1 February 2012, she was given the job title of &#8220;student coordinator for health affairs&#8221; with job number 187. This continued until the termination of her employment. This job title, however, was not an accurate description of her work. She was given this title as it attracted a higher salary. Despite this title, she continued to work as a Post Room Clerk until June 2016, when she was transferred to the role of Secretary.</p>

The Embassy disputes this. This issue was not determined by Employment Judge Brown at the preliminary hearing on immunity and does not feature in the decision of the Employment Tribunal which is the subject of this appeal. Waiver of immunity is therefore not an issue in this appeal. However, the Court was informed that the respondent will ask that the issue be remitted to the Employment Tribunal in the event that the Embassy&#8217;s appeal is successful.</p>

In its judgment on <span style="font-style:italic">Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v Italy; Greece intervening)</span> [2012] ICJ Rep 99, the International Court of Justice (&#8220;ICJ&#8221;) concluded (at paras 56, 57) that State practice shows that, &#8220;whether in claiming immunity for themselves or according it to others, States generally proceed on the basis that there is a right to immunity under international law, together with a corresponding obligation on the part of other States to respect and give effect to that immunity&#8221;. The ICJ considered that the rule of State immunity derives from the principle of sovereign equality of States which is one of the fundamental principles of the international legal order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">These statements demonstrate the importance of compliance by domestic courts with international law rules on State immunity. If a court exercises jurisdiction over a foreign State which is entitled to State immunity, there is a breach of international law. To require a foreign State entitled to immunity to appear before a court and to enquire into its conduct of sovereign affairs would be a violation of the foreign State&#8217;s sovereignty. This also explains why it was necessary to include in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/33" uk:canonical="1978 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">SIA 1978</ref> a provision which requires a court to give effect to State immunity even if the State does not appear in the proceedings and does not take the point itself. A provision such as section 1(2) of the SIA 1978 is necessary in order to ensure that domestic courts do not exercise jurisdiction in breach of a foreign State&#8217;s right to immunity. (See, generally, Bielby and Sanger [2024] CLJ 397, 400.) As the matter relates to jurisdiction, there must be a duty on a domestic court to take the point of its own motion.</p>

They brought separate claims in the Employment Tribunal against their employers including claims for unfair dismissal, failure to pay the minimum wage and breach of the Working Time Regulations 1998 (SI 1998/1833). The defendants asserted immunity under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/33/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/33" uk:canonical="1978 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">SIA 1978</ref>. In his judgment in the Supreme Court, with which the other members of the Supreme Court agreed, Lord Sumption concluded that, in determining whether sections 4(2)(b) and 16 of the SIA 1978 were compatible with article 6 ECHR and with article 47 of the EU Charter, the test was whether the sections were consistent with a rule of customary international law which denied the English courts jurisdiction in such cases. In the absence of such a rule of customary international law, the grant of immunity would be an unjustified infringement of the right of access to the court under article 6 ECHR and of the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal under article 47 of the EU Charter. Lord Sumption examined the history of State immunity and concluded that the true basis of the doctrine was the equality of sovereigns and that it never had warranted immunity extending beyond what sovereigns did in their capacity as such (para 52). Immunity was limited to acts by a State in the exercise of sovereign authority as opposed to acts of a private law character.</p>

Diplomatic agents participate in the functions of a diplomatic mission defined in article 3, principally representing the sending state, protecting the interests of the sending state and its nationals, negotiating with the government of the receiving state, ascertaining and reporting on developments in the receiving state and promoting friendly relations with the receiving state. These functions are inherently governmental. They are exercises of sovereign authority. Every aspect of the employment of a diplomatic agent is therefore likely to be an exercise of sovereign authority. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">The role of technical and administrative staff is by comparison essentially ancillary and supportive. It may well be that the employment of some of them might also be exercises of sovereign authority if their functions are sufficiently close to the governmental functions of the mission. Cypher clerks might arguably be an example. Certain confidential secretarial staff might be another: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Governor of Pitcairn v Sutton</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"> [1995] 1 NZLR 426 (New Zealand Court of Appeal).</span> However, I find it difficult to conceive of cases where the employment of purely domestic staff of a diplomatic mission could be anything other than an act jure gestionis. The employment of such staff is not inherently governmental. It is an act of a private law character such as anyone with the necessary resources might do.&#8221; (Emphasis added.)</p>

Therefore, it may not specifically enforce a contract of employment with a foreign embassy or make a reinstatement order in favour of an employee who has been dismissed. But a claim for damages for wrongful dismissal does not require the foreign state to employ any one. It merely adjusts the financial consequences of dismissal. No right of the foreign state under the Vienna Convention is infringed by the assertion of jurisdiction in the forum state to carry out that adjustment. Therefore, no right under the Vienna Convention would be prejudiced by the refusal of the forum state to recognise the immunity of the foreign state as regards a claim for damages.&#8221;</p>

Lord Sumption observed (at para 73) that <span style="font-style:italic">Sengupta</span> was decided at an early stage of the development of the law and that the test applied was far too wide. He also agreed with the statement in what is now <span style="font-style:italic">Fox and Webb</span> p 202, footnote 177, that the decision appeared to have had more regard to the purpose than the commercial nature of the clerical work involved.</p>

We did not hear argument on the point, but it appears that many of the acts pleaded in the Details of Complaint as alleged acts of harassment or discrimination occurred before 18 October 2017. It is likely that a cause of action will have arisen at the date each act of harassment or discrimination occurred. On the other hand, notice of termination of the respondent&#8217;s employment was given on 16 October 2017 (according to the liability judgment of the Employment Tribunal referred to in paragraph 28 above) but did not take effect until 17 January 2018. The respondent maintains that her dismissal was an act of direct discrimination or harassment which falls within the ambit of the Remedial Order because the cause of action crystallised on the date of termination of her employment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">While <span style="font-style:italic">Benkharbouche</span> concerned the employment of domestic staff of a diplomatic mission, the respondent in the present case was a member of the administrative staff of the mission. In order to determine whether the employment of technical and administrative staff of a diplomatic mission is a sovereign activity requiring immunity in international law, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/33/section/16/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(1)</ref>(aa) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/33" uk:canonical="1978 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">SIA 1978</ref> as amended and the principles stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Benkharbouche </span>apply. First, it is necessary to consider whether the State entered into the contract of employment in the exercise of sovereign authority. This will require an examination of the nature of the relationship between the parties to the contract of employment and the functions which the employee is employed to perform. While the role of technical and administrative staff is, by comparison with diplomatic agents, essentially ancillary and supportive, this is not determinative. It may be that the ancillary and supportive functions of some employees are sufficiently closely connected to the governmental functions of the mission to make their employment an exercise of sovereign authority. The examples given by Lord Sumption in <span style="font-style:italic">Benkharbouche</span> include cypher clerks or certain confidential secretaries. The outcome will depend on the proximity of each employee&#8217;s role to the governmental functions of the mission. Secondly, however, even if the contract of employment itself was not entered into in the exercise of sovereign authority, immunity may be required because the State engaged in the conduct complained of in the exercise of sovereign authority. Under this head the State&#8217;s sovereign interests may be engaged by the proceedings because of the treatment accorded to the employee by the State. Examples of cases within this second head given in <span style="font-style:italic">Benkharbouche</span> include dismissal for reasons of State security or challenges to the State&#8217;s recruitment policy. It also seems clear that a claim for reinstatement would be defeated by immunity because it would be an intrusion into the internal affairs of the mission to require reinstatement.</p>

This is a reference to Lord Sumption&#8217;s statement that while the role of technical and administrative staff is essentially ancillary and supportive, &#8220;[i]t may well be that the employment of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">some</span> of them might also be exercises of sovereign authority if their functions are sufficiently close to the governmental functions of the mission&#8221; (emphasis added).

She found that while the respondent might have been able to access wide-ranging confidential information using her username on the computer system, she was unaware that she could do so, her job roles did not require her to do so and she never in fact did so.

The judge found that the respondent genuinely believed that the Cultural Bureau looked after the arrangements of Saudi students in the United Kingdom and did not handle confidential government information. Judge Brown accepted evidence that the respondent may well have had access to the names, contact details, ID and passport details of invitees to Career Days and Graduation Ceremonies between 2012 and 2015 for the purpose of inviting them to the event. Judge Brown considered that the respondent might have had access to some confidential personal contacts and ID details of government and Royal attendees. However, she decided that this did not mean that the respondent&#8217;s role was close to the governmental function of the mission. In my view, she was clearly entitled to come to this conclusion.

In particular, it is said that it would require investigation into why the respondent was not given any further work from May 2017 following the appointment of a new cultural attach&#233;, the decision to transfer her back to the Administrative Affairs Department in the last week of September 2017 and the reasons for the decision to terminate her employment. These further submissions lack any substance. First, the respondent seeks compensation and a declaration. She does not seek reinstatement. The appellant&#8217;s right to decide who is employed at the mission is not restricted in any way by the claim. Secondly, the appellant has produced no evidence to support the suggestion that the treatment of the respondent engaged the State&#8217;s sovereign interests. There has been no accusation of wrongdoing on the part of the respondent. There has been no disciplinary investigation against her. There has been no suggestion that her dismissal was connected in any way with sovereign matters such as State security. If the appellant were entitled to immunity in these circumstances, there would be such an entitlement in every case of dismissal of a member of the administrative staff of a mission.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">For these reasons I consider that in the circumstances of this case the Court of Appeal was under a duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/33/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/33" uk:canonical="1978 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">SIA 1978</ref> to consider whether it was obliged to give effect to the State immunity claimed by the appellant notwithstanding the failure of the appellant to attend the hearing. That court&#8217;s failure to give proper consideration to this issue was an error of law. However, if it had addressed this issue it would necessarily have concluded that the appellant was not entitled to immunity. I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.</p>
