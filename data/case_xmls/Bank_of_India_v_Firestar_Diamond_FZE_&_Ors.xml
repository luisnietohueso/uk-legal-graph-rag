Mr Modi is an Indian born Belgian businessman who, prior to 2018, owned a wholesale diamond business and a luxury jewellery retail business eponymously named NIRAV MODI. The business was headquartered in Mumbai, India and at its height had several retail stores around the world. The story of the rise and fall of Mr Modi&#8217;s business empire is the subject of a Netflix documentary entitled: &#8216;Bad Boy Billionaires: India Diamonds Aren&#8217;t Forever&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Modi is presently in custody at HMP Thameside pending his extradition to India, where he faces three sets of criminal proceedings. The first<span style="color:#000000"> brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (&#8220;the CBI&#8221;) relates to an alleged fraud on the Punjab National Bank, which caused losses in the order of US$1 billion. The second, brought by the Enforcement Directorate, relates to the alleged laundering of the proceeds of that fraud and the third relates to additional offences involving the alleged interference with evidence and witnesses in the CBI proceedings. Mr Modi was initially arrested in London in 2019 and, although his appeals against extradition have been unsuccessful, he remains on remand in the United Kingdom pending the outcome of what have been described as &#8220;confidential proceedings&#8221;. I understand that those proceedings are ongoing and are unlikely to conclude until late 2026. Over the last six years, Mr Modi has made several unsuccessful applications for bail, the last of which took place on 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;color:#000000">th</span><span style="color:#000000"> May 2024. For present purposes, therefore, it is overwhelmingly likely that Mr Modi will remain in prison for the period up to and including the trial of this claim scheduled to take place in January next year. I should add that Mr Modi denies the criminal allegations that have been made against him and emphasises the fact that, as matters stand, he has not been convicted of any offence.</span></p>

The first is an application by Mr Modi for a stay of the present proceedings on the grounds that his incarceration in prison means that he will be unable to obtain a fair trial contrary to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and/or because any attempt by him to obtain documents or secure witness statements would expose him to the risk of further criminal allegations of witness tampering and intimidation and prejudice any future application for bail. The second is an application by Mr Modi for an order for inspection of three core contractual documents which are referred to in the Claimant&#8217;s Statement of Case and were included in its Initial Disclosure. Mr Modi has made a witness statement in support of both applications.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is common ground between the parties that the Court has jurisdiction to stay proceedings as part of its general case management powers (see: CPR Part 3.1(g) and section 49(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981). The power to stay proceedings is discretionary and is to be exercised in accordance with the Overriding Objective. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is no general principle that a party in prison is entitled to an adjournment or stay of civil proceedings because of the practical constraints which incarceration imposes upon them, see: <span style="font-style:italic">Wright &amp; Ors v Chappell &amp; Ors</span> [2023] EWHC 2873 at [49] per Leech J. Each case must be assessed by reference to the nature and scope of the claim and its own individual circumstances. Mr Modi did not suggest otherwise. Rather, he submitted that because he has no access to the internet or to a laptop in prison there is no reasonable prospect of him being able effectively to conduct his defence of this claim as a litigant in person. He contends that his lack of access to IT facilities whilst in prison means that there is an &#8216;inequality or arms&#8217; which undermines his right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. As Mr Modi figuratively put it during his oral submissions: &#8216;The bank has tanks and missiles, but I only have wooden sticks&#8217;. He maintains that the only way in which his Article 6 rights to a fair hearing can be protected by the Court is for there to be a stay of the proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant opposes the application for a stay. Mr Beasley submits that there is no example in the authorities of proceedings being stayed because of unequal footing issues and no justification for a stay on the particular facts of this case. He points out that, notwithstanding the lack of access to a laptop and internet facilities, Mr Modi has been supplied with hard copy bundles and has been able to correspond with the Claimant&#8217;s solicitors and participate effectively in both the CCMC and the hearing of these applications. He also relies on the fact that Mr Modi has been able to conduct other proceedings such as his bail applications, US bankruptcy proceedings, Trust proceedings in the Chancery Division (in which Mr Modi is a Claimant and has been provided with 7-8 bundles of documents) and also the ongoing &#8220;confidential proceedings&#8221;. Mr Beasley also submits that, despite his claim of impecuniosity, Mr Modi appears able to call upon resources when it suits him to do so. By way of example, the Claimant relied on the fact that Mr Modi was able to secure a loan of &#163;20,000 to enable him to instruct solicitors to prepare the current applications and a skeleton argument, he was able to arrange for a business colleague to offer the Court &#163;500,000 by way of security in support of his latest bail application and that he has been able to engage the services of English lawyers to represent him in the Trust proceedings as well as lawyers in India. Insofar as there is any inequality of arms between the parties, Mr Beasley submitted that this did not prejudice the possibility of a fair trial and could be satisfactorily addressed by appropriate case management directions and variations to the pre-trial timetable. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This principle is reflected in the Overriding Objective which requires the Court to manage cases in a way which &#8220;so far as is practicable&#8221; ensures that parties are on &#8220;an equal footing and can participate fully in proceedings&#8221; (CPR Part 1.1(2)(a)). However, I remind myself that &#8216;equality of arms&#8217; does not mean &#8216;equality of resources&#8217; but is concerned with ensuring equality of opportunity in the adversarial process, see: <span style="font-style:italic">Brake &amp; Ors v Chedington Court Estate Ltd</span> [2021] EWHC 2700 at [13]. The focus is on the need for procedural fairness. In other words, it is not a matter of restraining Goliath but ensuring that David has a reasonable opportunity to cast his stone. It must also be borne in mind that the Claimant has an equal right under Article 6 to a fair trial &#8220;within a reasonable time&#8221; which right could be undermined in the event that the Court stays proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I accept Mr Modi&#8217;s evidence that he has no access to the internet while in prison. Given the security risks posed by internet access, the National Security Framework and IT Security Policy severely restrain prisoners&#8217; access to the internet whilst in custody. That undoubtedly places Mr Modi at a disadvantage compared to ordinary litigants in person. It means he cannot conduct any legal research (via searchable internet databases such as bailii.org or the national archives) should he wish to do so. It also means he cannot access the many online resources that support litigants in person (such as Advocate at weareadvocate.org.uk or the &#8216;Handbook for Litigants in Person&#8217; available on the judiciary website). Most significantly and the point on which Mr Modi specifically relies, it also means he cannot access or search the Civil Procedure Rules (&#8220;the CPR&#8221;) which are freely available online.</p>

Significantly, in the present context, in answer to the submission that the rules were inaccessible and obscure, Lord Sumption said [at 19]: &#8220;I do not accept this. They are accessible on the internet.&#8221; That is, of course, true but assumes that all litigants in person have access to the internet.</p>

The Claimant&#8217;s solicitors replied on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> May 2024 enclosing printed copies of the Commercial Court Guide, the Circuit Commercial Court Guide and limited extracts from the CPR. As to the CPR as a whole, the Claimant&#8217;s solicitors directed Mr Modi to the link on the justice.gov.uk website.

Any application on these matters will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis, against the criteria assigned in this Policy Framework for criminal matters such as the nature of the material to be viewed and the volume of documents.

Mr Modi should therefore augment his application to also refer to the existence of the present proceedings and to the fact that the hearing bundle for these applications alone exceeded 1000 pages in length and that the bundles for the trial next January are likely to be considerably more voluminous. I also direct Mr Modi to supply a copy of this judgment (once it is available in hard copy) to the National A2DE Team at HMP Belmarsh (via the relevant officer at HMP Thameside) so they can consider its contents when determining his application.</p>

However, I hope that the application will have been resolved one way or another by the time of the PTR in September of this year. Needless to say, if the application succeeds then that will serve to rectify the &#8216;inequality of arms&#8217; caused by the lack of a laptop of which Mr Modi complains.</p>

On any view, if Mr Modi remains without access to a laptop the existing directions laid down by HHJ Pelling KC at the CCMC (that provide for him to only be supplied with the trial bundles in electronic format) will need to be revisited. While I appreciate that Article 6 does not ordinarily entitle an impecunious litigant in person to be supplied with a hard copy of the trial bundles at the Claimant&#8217;s expense (see: <span style="font-style:italic">Axnoller Events Ltd v Brake</span> [2021] EWHC 1706 at [30]), that assumes the litigant in person has access to technology on which to view an electronic version of the bundles. </p>

Furthermore, the fact that certain potential witnesses may be unwilling to engage with Mr Modi or refuse to provide a witness statement are common problems for litigants and do not justify a stay of these proceedings (see: <span style="font-style:italic">Bankas Snoras v Antonov</span> [2013] EWHC 131 at [41] per Gloster J).</p>
