	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000">This judgment concerns nine appeals against decisions of the Employment Tribunal (&#8220;ET&#8221;) to transfer the proceedings in the underlying cases to the ET office at Watford.  When communicating these decisions, in all but the case relating to Wolf Data Systems, there had been a failure to identify the relevant decision-taker and/or to provide reasons for the decision and, to that extent, the appeals in question would be formally allowed.  When considering disposal, however, it was clear that no injustice arose from the transfer decisions and, applying the overriding objective, there could only be one answer: dealing with the proceedings fairly and justly required that the claims be transferred to the Watford office of the ET.  As the errors identified could thus have no material effect on the result, it was appropriate, pursuant to section 35 </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">Employment Tribunals Act 1996</span><span style="color:#000000">, to exercise the powers of the ET and to confirm each of the transfer decisions made (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Jafri v Lincoln College</span><span style="color:#000000"> [2014] EWCA Civ 449 applied). </span></p>

Five of the respondents to these appeals have been debarred as having failed to enter a respondent&#8217;s answer; communications sent to the respondent in EA-2022-001155-AT have been returned undelivered and no representation from the respondent has been received in relation to the appeal in that case.  At the hearing before us, the claimant has appeared in person, as he has at all stages of the proceedings save when he was represented by leading counsel (acting under the Employment Law Appeals Advice Scheme; &#8220;ELAAS&#8221;) at a hearing under rule 3(10) </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">Employment Appeal Tribunal Rules 1993</span><span style="color:#000000"> on 23 November 2023, which concerned the first five appeals before us.

The submission was in fact an application (albeit not made on the relevant application form) for permission to reinstate grounds of appeal previously rejected by His Honour Judge Shanks in relation to the first five appeals before us (and, we should add, by other Judges of the EAT when permitting the remaining appeals to also proceed to a full hearing), by which the claimant had sought to allege that the decisions made by the ET demonstrated victimisation and bias on the part of Regional Employment Judge (&#8220;REJ&#8221;) Foxwell.  We addressed this application at the outset of the hearing of the appeal, providing our reasons for rejecting it at that stage, which are now set out in this judgment.</span></p>

Due to delays on the part of the EAT administration, however, HHJ Shanks&#8217; order was only seal dated (and sent out) on 29 April 2023.  </span></p>

We return to the content of that response in our substantive judgment, below.  It was, however, the claimant&#8217;s submission that REJ Foxwell had failed to provide the documents required by the EAT and that his account was not accurate as minutes of meetings of the ET national user group do not record any requests being made to other REJs regarding the claimant&#8217;s claims.  The claimant also says that it is unlikely that the London REJs would have been aware of his claims as, at the relevant time (January 2021), he had &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">lodged only a limited number of claims in each of the three other London Employment Tribunals</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;.  The claimant contends that REJ Foxwell&#8217;s delay in responding to the EAT&#8217;s order dated 23 November 2022 (and what he describes as REJ Foxwell&#8217;s failure to &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">say the truth</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221; in saying it had only been drawn to his attention in June 2023), and his failure to then properly comply, provides &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">a new and further evidence of victimisation and bias against me</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;.  The original source of this &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">victimisation and bias</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221; is said to derive from the fact that the claimant had previously made a complaint against an employment Judge sitting at Watford; as the relevant REJ, that complaint would have been dealt with by REJ Foxwell.  </span></p>

Although it would seem that the EAT only sent REJ Foxwell&#8217;s response of 8 June 2023 to the parties on 11 October 2023, the claimant has still waited over a year before making this application.  Certainly there is nothing &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">new</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221; that would warrant an application being made on the morning of the full hearing to reinstate grounds of appeal that the claimant knew had been dismissed over two years ago.  We are, moreover, satisfied that the application is misconceived.  REJ Foxwell&#8217;s explanation makes clear why no further documents were sent in response to HHJ Shanks&#8217; request: the subject of the claimant&#8217;s various ET claims was raised orally at a meeting on 4 January 2021 of London and South East REJs (</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">not</span><span style="color:#000000"> the national user group); thereafter the transfers took place administratively by email.  As for why the London REJs might have been aware of the claimant&#8217;s claims, the print-out we have obtained from the ET suggests that some 12 claims had been lodged by the claimant in the London regions at the relevant time and, given the nature of the claims we have seen (written in the same manner, making claims in respect of job advertisements for which no application had been made), it would be appropriate for issues of case management to come to the attention of the relevant REJs. </span></p>

To the extent that the claimant says it was only after receiving REJ Foxwell&#8217;s response of 8 June 2023 that he considered there was a proper basis for applying to reinstate those grounds of appeal, it would then have been open to him to either apply (out of time) to the EAT for review, or to apply (out of time) for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.  Instead, the claimant has waited over a year after receiving REJ Foxwell&#8217;s response to make this application.  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">For the reasons we have provided, the application to reinstate previously dismissed grounds of appeal is dismissed as being totally without merit</span><span style="color:#000000">. </span></p>

This ultimately culminated in the claimant requesting that the EAT should now order REJ Foxwell to provide further documentation and/or clarification.  We decided to treat this as a separate application, reaching our decision after hearing the claimant&#8217;s submissions in this regard.  For reasons given orally at the hearing, we also refused this application, finding that it was totally without merit.  Again, we have set out those reasons in this judgment for ease of reference. </span></p>

Again the claimant suggested that REJ Foxwell had delayed in responding to the EAT and he further complained of the EAT&#8217;s delay in forwarding the response to the parties.  </span></p>

In any event, the seal date on HHJ Shanks&#8217; order makes clear that this was not sent to the ET until 29 April 2023, so it is not correct to say (as the claimant has maintained) that REJ Foxwell&#8217;s delay was from 23 November 2022 (the date of the rule 3(10) hearing) to 8 June 2023.  Moreover, given our experience of the administrative delays in both the EAT and ET, we find it entirely plausible that the EAT&#8217;s request did not then find its way to REJ Foxwell until early June 2023.  We do not draw any inference of undue delay on the part of the REJ.  The same cannot, however, be said of the claimant.  As the record makes clear, REJ Foxwell&#8217;s response of 8 June 2023 was sent out to all parties on 11 October 2023; if the claimant considered this raised legitimate concerns as to the content of that response, he could have made an application to the EAT at that stage.  We can see no proper reason for the delay in making an application for disclosure of any minutes from the REJ meeting of 4 January 2021.  In any event, it is apparent to us that a written record of what transpired at that meeting was sent to the claimant by letter from REJ Foxwell on 19 January 2021, and there is no reason to consider that does other than set out the nature of the discussion, providing an explanation for why the claimant&#8217;s claims before the different London ET regions were then transferred to the Watford office.  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">For all these reasons, we refuse this application for an order that the ET provide further disclosure/information; we are satisfied that this is an application that has been pursued vexatiously and is totally without merit</span><span style="color:#000000">. </span></p>

Similarly, the claimant made no application for recusal at the hearing on 11 December 2024 itself;  rather he waited until after the weekend after the hearing, notwithstanding that it had been made clear that the panel would be starting its deliberations immediately after the oral submissions had been completed.

His modus operandi has been to find advertisements on the internet, that appear to be discriminatory, for jobs up and down the British Isles, and then bring claims in the Employment Tribunals, often without having applied for the job. It might be said that employers who do not take care with their job advertisements have only themselves to blame. But Mr Ramos does not act for the public good, he claims loss of earnings and injury to feelings. The wide geographical scope and variety of roles for which Mr Ramos applies puts in question whether he really wishes to be appointed.

The present appeals all relate to claims filed in one of the three London regions (London East, London Central, London South); each case was transferred to the ET South East Region.  As at March 2023, 52 claims brought by the claimant were held by the ET South East region.  Following a request made by the EAT to the Watford ET office for the purposes of this hearing, we understand that some 66 claims by the claimant appear on the records.  We understand that these relate to claims brought by the claimant in London and the South East, and do not include claims brought in other regions, or claims brought before the ET in Scotland.  In addition, according to the records held by the EAT, some 42 appeals have also been pursued by the claimant.  </span></p>

Unfortunately, the claimant failed to take that course for reasons that I consider were spurious. He took the view that he could not make an application for review without first obtaining the Tribunal&#8217;s reasons, but that was clearly no obstacle as it did not prevent him appealing or setting out his submissions to the Tribunal as to why the transfer order should not have been made. He also considered he would have been out of time, but he would not as the application is for a review of a case management order under Rule 29 to which no time limit applies. Despite the claimant&#8217;s failure to take the opportunity I gave him, which is to be deprecated, as I am now aware that there are other appeals proceeding to a full hearing on this point, I grant permission for this appeal to join those other cases.&#8221;</p>

Relying on points made at the rule 3(10) hearing, the claimant complains that each of the decisions under appeal were local implementations of a general request made by REJ Foxwell to the REJs of the three London regions, but, in each case, his view was not sought prior to the decision to transfer, and the letters confirming the transfer did not identify the relevant decision-taker (contrary to rule 60 </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">ET Rules</span><span style="color:#000000">) and (contrary to rule 62) did not provide reasons for that decision.  The claimant says that case management orders made without giving a party a reasonable opportunity to make representations must be capable of meaningful challenge; that was consistent with the rulings of the EAT in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Berrendero</span><span style="color:#000000"> and </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Faleye</span><span style="color:#000000">, and was in keeping with the open justice principle.

He further contended that it was in the interests of justice that his claims were dealt with by different ET offices, not least as it would be difficult for one ET to deal with a large number of claims, and argued that the reasons for the original transfer decision, as set out in the letter of 19 January 2021, could not withstand scrutiny: the issue of double recovery did not arise at this early stage of the proceedings, and there was no requirement on a claimant to disclose the fact that he had made other claims when these had not been brought against the same employer.  Moreover, the claimant pointed out that the transfer decisions had led to the postponement of hearings and had caused delay in the proceedings, which would not be in the interests of justice as it would mean that witness memories would fade.  </span></p>

Standardly, when the ET sent out an order, this would be accompanied by a letter explaining rights of appeal and reconsideration; that was not done in this case.  This, the claimant says, had a real consequence for him: although Mr Kohanzad had argued that he ought to have applied for reconsideration, the letter of 19 January 2021 was not accompanied by guidance as to the right to make such an application, and the later letters confirming the various transfers did not identify the Judge, still less give reasons for the decision/s.  In any event, the claimant says that he did make applications for reconsideration but received no response (in this regard, the claimant produced the correspondence in the Hello Services case to which we have referred above, but said he had been prejudiced by not being put on notice of this point earlier (saying he would have put all the relevant documents before the EAT if this had been raised earlier)).  </span></p>

Initially submitting that it should not be seen as a case management order but merely an administrative function (akin to the initial allocation of a case to a region), Mr Kohanzad said that even if that was not correct, then the letter of 19 January 2021 should be seen as communicating the case management decision in issue, with the subsequent letter (as the claimant would have understood) being merely the administrative execution of that decision.  As for any failure to give reasons: (1) initially there was no reason to consider that the claimant should take issue with the transfers, so, as there was no dispute, rule 65 was not engaged; (2) in any event, the letter of 19 January 2021 did provide the reasons.</span></p>

Otherwise, the ET ought to be able to get on with the progression of the claims before it, addressing objections as and when they were raised by the parties.  The letter confirming the transfer of the proceedings could be seen as akin to the provision of a formal judgment, such that the parties could, if considered necessary, then ask for written reasons and/or could apply for the ET to reconsider the underlying decision. </span></p>

In each case, the claimant&#8217;s appeal is against the letter sent out to him confirming the transfer of his claim to the ET Watford office.  It is apparent, however, that in each instance, the transfer implemented a decision taken in the early part of January 2021, when the REJs for the three London regions and for the South East region agreed that similar claims issued by the claimant in those regions would all be case managed together at the ET Watford office.  That decision had been communicated to the claimant, in the letter from REJ Foxwell of 19 January 2021.  Although that letter was specifically addressed to the claimant&#8217;s claims &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">currently proceeding in the London East, London Central and London South Regions</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;, it is clear that the subsequent transfers of other claims (including each of the nine that are the subject of these appeals, albeit, as at 19 January 2021, only three of them had been issued) followed this earlier decision and were made for the same reasons.  </span></p>

The location of ET offices, and the way in which work is allocated to particular locations, is a matter within the very wide discretion afforded to the ET President (which may be delegated to REJs) under regulation 7 of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">2013 Regulations</span><span style="color:#000000">.  Plainly, however, the particular allocation of an individual claim will require no decision on the part of the ET President (or any REJ); unless and until an issue arises in relation to the proceedings in question, this will be a purely administrative function that will not engage the provisions of rules 60 and 62.  Indeed, as rule 85 </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">ET Rules</span><span style="color:#000000"> makes clear, the only requirement is that the ET notify the parties of the address of the office that will be dealing with the case (and of any change in that address); there is no suggestion that this involves a judicial decision that will engage the requirements of rules 60 or 62.</span></p>

Where, however, the transfer results from some active judicial intervention, then we consider that is a case management decision which should thus be communicated in writing to the parties (assuming the decision to have been made without a hearing), identifying the Judge who made it (per rule 60).  In the claim brought against Wolf Data Systems, that was done.  Although the claimant appeals against the subsequent letter (of 19 July 2021), confirming the transfer, it is apparent that the decision made by REJ Wade was communicated to him in writing on 15 July 2021, not only identifying the relevant decision-taker but also providing the reasons for that decision.  Similarly, in relation to the claim against Murat Tchoukour, the letter informing the claimant of the transfer also identified the relevant decision-taker (&#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">as directed by Judge Balogun</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221;), albeit it did not set out any explanation of the reasons for the decision.  In the other cases before us, however, we have not seen any letter identifying the Judge who made the transfer decision.  The question is whether that amounts to an error of law.  Additionally, save in the Wolf Data Systems case, was it wrong for the communications to the claimant to merely state the fact of the transfer without providing reasons?</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">In answering these questions, we consider the communications sent to the claimant have to be seen in context.  It is, therefore, relevant that the claimant had already received REJ Foxwell&#8217;s letter of 19 January 2021 and was aware that the decision had been taken (identifying REJ Foxwell as the relevant decision-taker) that his claims in the London and the South East regions should be dealt with together at the ET office at Watford.  The reasons for that decision had been explained and, on one view, the information required under the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">ET Rules</span><span style="color:#000000"> had thus been provided.  Having regard to the overriding objective, and the need to try to avoid unnecessary formality, we can see that it might be thought that this should be sufficient.  On the other hand, however, it is also relevant to note that, other than the specific cases referenced in the letter of 19 January 2021 (not any of the cases now before us), other parties to the proceedings in question would not have known who had made the decision to transfer the case and would not have been aware of the reasons for that decision.  Moreover, as REJ Foxwell&#8217;s letter to the EAT (of 8 June 2023) makes clear, claims that post-dated the discussion on 4 January 2021 were subsequently transferred without prior consultation with him, such that he could not properly be described as the relevant decision-taker in each of those cases.  Other than in the cases involving Wolf Data Systems and Murat Tchoukour, we therefore agree with the claimant that it was wrong that the letters sent out confirming the transfer did not identify the name of the Judge who had made this direction.  Moreover, other than the claim brought against Wolf Data Systems, it was wrong that no explanation was provided for the transfer decision, albeit (pursuant to rule 62(4)) need only have been very short. </span></p>

As we have observed, the claimant was in fact well aware of the decision that underpinned each of these transfers: the letter of 19 January 2021 had clearly explained to him why his claims in London and the South East were being combined for case management purposes and had told him who had made this decision.  Although the respondents to the claims in question did not have the same advantage, we are not aware that any of those concerned ever raised an objection.

As a matter of fact, the claimant has pursued appeals against each of these decisions.  It is also apparent that he sought a reconsideration of the transfer decision in the Wolf Data Systems case, and we have seen correspondence in which he similarly made a request that the transfer in the Hello Services claim be revoked.  Indeed, at the hearing before us, the claimant emphasised that he had made a number of reconsideration applications, albeit he did not have all the relevant documentation available, as (he argued) he had not had proper forewarning that this might be an issue on his appeals.  We do not accept that the claimant can reasonably say he was unaware that the question whether he had applied for reconsideration of the transfer decisions might be a relevant issue at this hearing: Judge Stout&#8217;s directions in EA-2023-000834-AT (relating to the proceedings involving Cafe on the Hill) had made clear that it was.   In any event, however, it is plain that the claimant was well aware that he was able to apply for the decisions to be varied or revoked and, notwithstanding any errors on the part of the ET, had sought to do so in at least two of the cases before us. </span></p>

As rule 29 </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">ET Rules</span><span style="color:#000000"> makes clear, this provides the ET with a very broad discretion in how it manages the claims before it, expressly allowing that such decisions may be made without affording the parties concerned a prior opportunity to make representations, providing that, in such cases, the ET may then vary, suspend or set aside its earlier order where that is necessary in the interests of justice.  Thus, as Judge Stout pointed out, to the extent that he considered it to be in the interests of justice, the course the claimant ought to have adopted was to apply to the ET for the transfer decision in issue to be set aside.  </span></p>

Equally, the transfer of proceedings to Watford might have given rise to some inconvenience for the parties in terms of travelling to the ET (although, we note that none of the respondents seems to have objected, and this is not a point that the claimant has identified or could reasonably complain about given that a number of his claims had been allocated to the Watford ET without him raising any concern).  It is less clear to us that case managing a larger number of claims should otherwise give rise to particular delays, or additional costs; on the contrary, given that the claimant&#8217;s claims are put on almost identical bases, there would seem to be an obvious saving in time and costs if these were case managed together.  As for the question of the claimant&#8217;s confidential information, we are unable to see that this could give rise to a legitimate concern.  No orders have been made anonymising any information in any of these cases, and we cannot see any basis on which such a derogation from the open justice principle could properly be made.  On the other hand, however, compelling reasons have been provided for transferring all the claims made in the London regions to the Watford office, to be combined for case management purposes with claims in the South East region.

There is, however, no basis for such an assertion.  The reason why REJ Foxwell determined that these claims should be case managed together is because that would best serve the overriding objective, dealing with these cases fairly and justly by ensuring all parties are on an equal footing (with the respondents thus being aware of the other claims brought), that the proceedings are dealt with in a proportionate way, and avoiding the expense and delays that would occur in the claims being considered across a number of ET offices.</span></p>
