Its first Definitive Deed and Rules was executed in 1994. The Staff Scheme was closed to new members with effect from 31 July 2005. This was reflected in a Deed of Variation with a new Deed and Rules dated 26 March 2009. A further Deed of Variation dated 29 December 2010 adopted a new Trust Deed and Rules (&#8220;the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules&#8221;) to replace the 2009 Trust Deed and Rules which ended the accrual of benefits for members with effect from 1 January 2011. Amendments to the Executive Scheme to close it to new members and to end accrual mirrored the changes to the Staff Scheme.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The proceedings come about because the claimant wishes to amend the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules so as to be able to accept a bulk transfer-in to the Staff Scheme of the beneficiaries, assets and liabilities of the Executive Scheme on an unsegregated basis. But for the fact that the claimant intends to use the power to amend the Staff Scheme at a time when both it and the Executive Scheme are in the course of being wound up and Arcadia is in liquidation, the proposal would be uncontroversial. However, in light of the late stage at which the power is to be exercised, the claimant considered it was appropriate to seek confirmation that there was no fetter on the power to amend and its use was for a proper purpose; and given that the decision can be characterised as a momentous one, the court&#8217;s approval was also sought.</span></p>

She has had the benefit of independent specialist legal advice from Sacker &amp; Partners and Mr Hitchcock. She concluded with the benefit of their advice that there are no realistic grounds upon which to oppose the claim. In accordance with the practice referred to in the Chancery Guide at 26.28 the defendant has been permitted to file a confidential opinion produced by Mr Hitchcock explaining why the claim is not opposed. The opinion has not been seen by the claimant. In addition, the court had the benefit, after hearing Mr Stallworthy&#8217;s submissions, of a hearing in private to consider Mr Hitchcock&#8217;s advice.</span></p>

That is ultimately a question of construction of the trust instrument or a statute or both. The practice of the Chancery Division is that a question of that sort must be decided in open court and only after hearing argument from both sides. It is not always easy to distinguish that situation from the second situation that I am coming to &#8230;</span></p>

In a case like that, there is no question of surrender of discretion and indeed it is most unlikely that the court will be persuaded in the absence of special circumstances to accept the surrender of discretion on a question of that sort, where the trustees are prima facie in a much better position than the court to know what is in the best interests of the beneficiaries.&#8221;</span></p>

The first declaration made by the court determines a binary issue, namely whether the proposed exercise of powers by the claimant to amend the Staff Scheme is within the scope and purpose of the claimant&#8217;s powers under the scheme. The exercise of that power to amend to enable a merger to take place at a time when the schemes are in the course of being wound up is unusual. The second declaration provides approval to the exercise of the power on the basis that the decision is a &#8216;momentous&#8217; one. </span></p>

However, category (2) is more concerned with the process of exercising the powers. The court is not concerned with whether the decision is objectively &#8216;correct&#8217; (in the sense that it is a decision the court would have made if asked) but rather whether the decision can be objectively justified and whether a proper process of decision making has been followed.

First, there are no special rules of construction applicable to a pension scheme; nevertheless, its provisions should wherever possible be construed to give reasonable and practical effect to the scheme, bearing in mind that it has to be operated against a constantly changing commercial background. It is important to avoid unduly fettering the power to amend the provisions of the scheme, thereby preventing the parties from making those changes which may be required by the exigencies of commercial life. This is particularly the case where the scheme is intended to be for the benefit not of the employees of a single company, but of a group of companies. The companies of the group may constantly change as companies are disposed of and new companies are acquired; and such changes may need to be reflected by modifications to the scheme. </span></p>

By changes made gradually over a long period, alterations may be made which would not be acceptable if introduced all at once.

It may be unusual for an amendment to be made in the course of winding up a scheme with the company in liquidation so as to permit a merger but that is not to the point. The power to amend was used in 2010 to introduce clause 1.3 which prevents a merger. The power to amend was expressly preserved for use by the trustee in the course of winding up the scheme and no express fetter was imposed. The power was intended to be both wide and flexible.

There is, however, an issue about whether the relevant context in which the 2010 Trust Deed and Rules are considered includes not just the Staff Scheme in the form in which it is found in 2010 (being the instrument conferring the power to amend) but also earlier versions of the scheme and the manner in which the power has been exercised up to that date.

This is illustrated by the fact that it was only in 2009 that the Staff Scheme was closed to merger. If the power was used in that way in 2009, and that was then an exercise for proper purposes, why might it not be a proper purpose to reverse that change the following year?</span></p>

Pension schemes may evolve by serial use of the power to amend.

The objective contemplates a changing group of members with new members being admitted.

		    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">When exercising a fiduciary power, trustees are required to inform themselves of the relevant facts and take into account relevant factors and ignore irrelevant ones (Harris v Shuttleworth [1994] ICR 991 at 999G-H; Pitt v Holt [2013] 2 AC 108; Lewin on Trusts (20th ed.) at [29-023]-[29-025] and [29-041]-[29-044]). As Lewin points out, although a number of authorities talk of taking into account &#8216;all relevant matters&#8217;, the range of circumstances required to be taken into account will depend on context. For example, time, urgency, quantum and cost may play a part. Lewin considers that the duty to take into consideration relevant matters is best regarded as an element of the duty to act responsibly. Trustees must have a rational basis for a decision but will be in breach only if a given matter is so significant that a failure to take it into account would be irrational. As to what is a relevant matter to take into account, the authorities, such as they are, indicate that this too depends on context, including the nature of the trust and power under consideration (Pitt v Holt [2011] EWCA Civ 197, [2012] Ch. 132 at [114]).</span></p>

The distinction between rationality and reasonableness was explained (in a different context) in Hayes v Willoughby [2013] 1 WLR 935 at [14] in the following terms:- &#8216;Rationality is not the same as reasonableness. Reasonableness is an external, objective standard applied to the outcome of a person's thoughts or intentions. &#8230; A test of rationality, by comparison, applies a minimum objective standard to the relevant person's mental processes. It imports a requirement of good faith, a requirement that there should be some logical connection between the evidence and the ostensible reasons for the decision, and (which will usually amount to the same thing) an absence of arbitrariness, of capriciousness or of reasoning so outrageous in its defiance of logic as to be perverse.&#8217; </span></p>

This requires the trustee not to act as no reasonable trustee would. In Edge v Pensions Ombudsman [1998] Ch 512, this was put in terms of not taking a decision that &#8216;that no reasonable body of trustees properly directing themselves could have reached&#8217; (Edge at 534, affirmed by the Court of Appeal in [2000] Ch. 602).&#8221;</span></p>

If pension fund trustees do that, they cannot be criticised if they reach a decision which appears to prefer the claims of one interest - whether that of employers, current employees or pensioners - over others. The preference will be the result of a proper exercise of the discretionary power.&#8221; (627D)</span></p>

This is an entirely proper matter for the claimant to have taken into account. The funding arrangements for the two schemes have been managed with a view to achieving equality between them and it is only as a consequence of unforeseen circumstances that it has not been achieved. Favouring the Staff Scheme over the Executive Scheme in the distribution of receipts, such as payments made by Lady Green, has meant that the Executive Scheme is the effective source of the surplus.</span></p>
