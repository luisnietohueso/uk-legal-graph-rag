	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The Claimant suffered from Aspergers Syndrome, a form of Autistic Spectrum Disorder. He had concealed the fact that he had this disability for his entire working life from both family and employers, although he had made it known to the employer against whom the present claim had been brought.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">He was concerned, both from personal experience, as well as widely available material including academic research, that, were knowledge of his disability to become public it would have a serious adverse effect on his employability. He had indicated that he would not proceed with his claim absent anonymity.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">This was the second appeal from the ET from this tribunal. The EAT held that the ET had set too high a bar for the claimant and had focussed on medical evidence and the fact that he had obtained employment, without having considered whether the new employer had been aware of the disability. This amounted to an error of law. Having all relevant material before it the EAT decided that there was only one possible outcome, namely that anonymity for both parties was not contrary to the public interest.</span></p>

Her stance was, taken as a whole, to accept the genuineness of the claimant&#8217;s belief as to the consequences of his name being in the public domain. Beyond that she relied on the skeleton argument which had been submitted earlier, which mirrored her submissions before the tribunal. Broadly she sought to uphold the decision of the employment judge as being in accordance with the relevant case law, and in particular Millicom Services UK Limited v Clifford 2023 ICR 663, a decision of the court of appeal, given by Warby LJ. That case involved very different facts, and concerned a witness rather than a party, but the principles are of relevance. </span></p>

In his witness statement he stated that there are published statistics, both unemployment rates among autistic people and also on attitudes to hiring autistic staff. Under cross examination, F gave evidence that after having left the employee of the respondent, he was now working in the education sector. He also accepted that none of the documents that he had annexed to his witness statement supported his assertion that he would not be able to find a job in the education sector in future if his autism were made public.</span></p>

The thrust of his argument has always been that, were his condition to be made public he would find it extremely difficult to find work in the education sector. He accepted that it was not possible to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">prove </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">something in the future which had not yet happened, and that a concession to that effect may well have been misunderstood by the employment judge. He pointed out that he would hardly have gone to the trouble of collating all these academic papers and other reports if he did not genuinely believe that the stigma attached to autism, including Asperger&#8217;s syndrome ,and the low employment rate of people with autism are such that, with the likely publicity arising from an employment tribunal claim laying bare his disability, his employment prospects would be severely and adversely affected.</span></p>

At paragraph 35 the tribunal noted the respondent&#8217;s submission that his fears regarding career prospects were not well founded or supported by objective evidence, neither was the psychological or medical evidence to support his contention that further disclosure of his disability would cause him any harm or indeed negative outcome. We pause to ask the rhetorical question how either psychological or medical evidence could possibly deal with the issue whether his fears that the stigma of his accepted autism would affect his future employability were well grounded. </span></p>

As to that, F provided no medical evidence that he would suffer any harm if his condition were disclosed. There was also no compelling evidence to support his claim that he would suffer harm in respect of his personal life and that he would be unable to form future relationships. With regard to harm to his employment prospects, the evidence that he produced for no relevance to his specific circumstances. He accepted that the article by Ameri and others primarily concerned the employability of individuals within the United States of America, not the United Kingdom. The other document that he used did not demonstrate that he would suffer damage to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">his </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">specific career prospects. It is clear to me that F Is a highly intelligent individual with an established track record of employment. He is educated to doctorate level and has found alternative employment in education since leaving the employee of the respondent. On the evidence before it, the tribunal is not satisfied that his professional life will be damaged if and anonymisation is not granted in his case&#8221;</span></p>

That is manifest from the Ameri et al paper (referred to paragraph 12.2 of the judgment) which demonstrated, by way of a live experiment,  that relatively experienced professionally qualified people who made clear that they had autism on a job application had a much lower take up from prospective employees than relatively inexperienced applicants who did not make such a declaration. The fact that this survey took place in America seems to us largely irrelevant.

It is inherently impossible to prove what will happen in the future. Medical and psychological evidence could well demonstrate the extent of the claimant&#8217;s disability, but could not possibly address the issue whether autism carried with it the stigma that the claimant asserted, and which gave rise to the fears which grounded his application. Moreover, it is difficult to see how any report could focus specifically on the claimant&#8217;s fears for his future without making some sort of assessment as to employability across the entire secondary and tertiary education spectrum. Again we ask, rhetorically how that could practically be done other than by way of a piece of experimental research of the sort carried out by Ameri and others. What F had to prove was that he had a reasonable foundation for his belief. We consider that is a relatively low evidential threshold.</span></p>

In requiring him to prove objectively that his fears were well grounded, it was setting the bar too high as too would have been requiring medical evidence which could not possibly meet the specific concern that the claimant had raised. The tribunal made much of the fact that the claimant had obtained work following the termination of his employment with the respondent but did not ask the question whether the new employer was aware of his disability. Had it not been, then that could have been of no relevance whatsoever to the issue before the tribunal.</span></p>

We have the benefit of all of the material that was before the employment tribunal. We also have the Buckland review, but observe that this does little more (for our purposes) than re-emphasise what the other material does, namely that those with autism are at a considerable disadvantage in the labour market. We have concluded unanimously, based on all of the material that we have read, that F&#8217;s concerns are genuinely held by him, and whilst it is simply impossible to say whether what he fears will indeed eventuate, should his name be published in connection with these proceedings, we consider that they have, at the very least, an objective foundation. We would go further and say that the material we have seen suggests that the belief is reasonable.</span></p>

The reason for the respondent being anonymised is that the level of detail which is likely to emerge in the proceedings is such that it would be highly likely to identify the claimant, were the respondent not similarly anonymised.</span></p>
