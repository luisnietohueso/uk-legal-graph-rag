The claimant is the appellant. The only issue in the appeal is whether the tribunal (Employment Judge Hendry sitting without non-legal members) erred in refusing him permission to amend his claim to include a contention that his dismissal by the respondents was automatically unfair because he had asserted a statutory right and/or made a protected disclosure. This decision was made at a preliminary hearing for case management purposes held in Aberdeen on 2 December 2022.</span></p>

The tribunal should do so having regard to all the circumstances. The &#8220;Selkent factors&#8221;, as they are sometimes called, are not a checklist to follow, but a non-exhaustive list of some of the circumstances that may be relevant to the balancing exercise. They are: the nature of the amendment; the applicability of time limits; and the timing and manner of the application.</span></p>

The EAT will not interfere too readily with the tribunal&#8217;s exercise of that discretion; an appellant must show that the tribunal has erred in legal principle in exercising it, or failed to take relevant considerations into account (or taken irrelevant factors into account), or that no reasonable tribunal, properly directing itself, could have refused the amendment. </span></p>

The boundaries between these different categories can be difficult to draw. But they matter: they influence whether the tribunal must consider the applicability of a time limit that has usually expired by reason of the passage of time during the litigation. Time limit issues do not arise in respect of mere re-labelling; see </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Reuters Limited v Cole</span><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> UKEAT/0258/17/BA (at paragraphs 12 to 15) and </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Foxtons Ltd v Ruwiel</span><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> UKEAT/0056/08/DA (at paragraph 13).

The litigant in person, who struggled to plead the claim initially, unsurprisingly, struggles to provide the additional information and, in trying to produce what has been requested, under increasing pressure, produces a document that makes up for in quantity what it lacks in clarity.

Strike out is not a way of avoiding rolling up one&#8217;s sleeves and identifying, in reasonable detail, the claims and issues; doing so is a prerequisite of considering whether the claim has reasonable prospects of success. Often it is argued that a claim is bound to fail because there is one issue that is hopeless. For example, in the protected disclosure context, it might be argued that the claimant will not be able to establish a reasonable belief in wrongdoing; however, it is generally not possible to analyse the issue of wrongdoing without considering what information the claimant contends has been disclosed and what type of wrongdoing the claimant contends the information tended to show.</span></p>

Respondents, particularly if legally represented, in accordance with their duties to assist the tribunal to comply with the overriding objective and not to take procedural advantage of litigants in person, should assist the tribunal to identify the documents, and key passages of the documents, in which the claim appears to be set out, even if it may not be explicitly pleaded in a manner that would be expected of a lawyer, and take particular care if a litigant in person has applied the wrong legal label to a factual claim that, if properly pleaded, would be arguable &#8230; </span></p>

So far as they can, they should seek to explain their claims clearly even though they may not know the correct legal terms. They should focus on their core claims rather than trying to argue every conceivable point. The more prolix and convoluted the claim is, the less a litigant in person can criticise an employment tribunal for failing to get to grips with all the possible claims and issues. Litigants in person should appreciate that, usually, when a tribunal requires additional information it is with the aim of clarifying, and where possible simplifying, the claim, so that the focus is on the core contentions. The overriding objective also applies to litigants in person, who should do all they can to help the employment tribunal clarify the claim. The employment tribunal can only be expected to take reasonable steps to identify the claims and issues. But respondents, and tribunals, should remember that repeatedly asking for additional information and particularisation rarely assists a litigant in person to clarify the claim.

Nonetheless, the judge concluded, there was &#8220;nothing to clearly suggest the dismissal was related in some way to the two matters now being suggested as reasons for dismissal&#8221; (paragraph 22) &#8211; those two matters being because he had asserted a statutory right to receive the national minimum wage (that is, not to receive a lesser amount of wages) and/or because he had made a protected disclosure that others did not receive the national minimum wage.</span></p>

In reply, Mr Hardman reminded me of the high hurdle that must be overcome in showing perversity, and contended that the judge&#8217;s conclusion was reasonably open to him.

The word &#8220;perversity&#8221; is perhaps overly blunt; the position, more fully, is that no reasonable tribunal, properly directing itself, would have concluded in this case that the claimant was raising an entirely new complaint, and this error fundamentally tainted the balancing exercise required.</span></p>

The claimant&#8217;s case was that his employer had subjected him to what he called &#8220;abuse&#8221;. I am mindful that the merits of the case have yet to be determined, but from the wording I have quoted from his ET1 form (at paragraphs 21 and 22 above) it was clear that, by &#8220;abuse&#8221;, the claimant was referring both to an allegation of not being paid properly and the so-called &#8220;assault&#8221; concerning his mental ill health. He also made clear his concerns that other employees were not being paid the national minimum wage, although it is much less clear that he asserted telling the respondents of his concerns in this regard prior to his dismissal.</span></p>

There was therefore a clear assertion of a causative link between the contentions he had made to one of the individual respondents and the subsequent decision to dismiss him: the claimant was plainly contending, at least in part, that the respondents reacted to his allegations of &#8220;financial abuse&#8221; by dismissing him.</span></p>

No reasonable tribunal could have concluded, as this tribunal concluded, that there was &#8220;nothing&#8221; in the ET1 form to suggest that the claimant believed he had been dismissed for asserting his right to receive the national minimum wage and/or for disclosing that others did not receive it.

Admittedly the claimant&#8217;s contentions were at risk of being obscured by other (rather florid) allegations made in his ET1 form but, as </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Cox</span><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> [2021] emphasises, it is the job of the tribunal to roll up its sleeves and clarify the issues to be determined. By way of a further idiom, the tribunal must try to sort the wheat from the chaff. If there had been any doubt as to whether the claimant&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;abuse&#8221; in the ET1 form encompassed allegations of financial abuse in the form of failing to pay him and other employees the national minimum wage, and that he was dismissed when he persisted in raising these concerns, it was removed by the document he provided on 27 October 2021. That document made clear, by way of further particulars, his contention that he had &#8220;made repeated representations about repeated shortfalls in payment&#8221;, the &#8220;failure to pay minimum wage&#8221;, and he described his dismissal as being &#8220;for assertion of a statutory right &#8211; whether under unlawful deductions or/NMWA&#8221; and &#8220;making a public interest disclosure&#8221;.</span></p>

Further, it was wrong of the judge to decide against the claimant on the basis that his contention could not properly be responded to; the concerns raised by the judge (what was said, by whom, about the minimum wage) could be addressed by particularisation, but they did not make this claim incapable of a sensible response. It was a further error of law (in the form of a procedural irregularity) for the judge to make a finding of fact about what the claimant had, or had not, had in mind when he completed the ET1 form in circumstances where he had heard no evidence from him. In such circumstances I further conclude that the balancing exercise carried out by the judge took into account irrelevant factors.</span></p>
