The claim is supported by a witness statement of the appellant, and he has filed three more in the course of the appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since 2010 there have been numerous disputes between the appellant on the one hand and his mother, the second respondent, and his three siblings, on the other, as to the distribution of the estate, in respect of which the distribution account of the estate in England and Wales stood at just under &#163;2 million. The costs orders against the appellant have been awarded in those disputes which were determined by the courts. These include a failed attempt by the appellant to challenge the validity of the will.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The bottom line of the appellant&#8217;s appeal, as he put it in his submissions to me, is that the costs are not owing, because in the estate accounts those costs have been deducted from the appellant&#8217;s share, as indeed they have. Ms Mattsson, for the respondents, replies that in reality the costs have not been paid, because the estate is showing a deficit from the appellant, when inheritance tax is taken into account under the Inheritance Act 1984, of some &#163;102,000. The reason for that, the appellant counters, is that the estate accounts wrongly place inheritance tax on his share rather on the estate, where the tax should fall under the 1984 Act. Ms Mattsson submits that this is the right treatment under the law of England and Wales, because the only other beneficiary, after a deed of variation, is the first respondent, and she is entitled to an exemption to such tax as her late husband&#8217;s spouse under section 18 of the 1984 Act..</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appellant&#8217;s witness statement in support of his claim was responded to by a witness statement dated 13 June 2023 of the respondents&#8217; solicitor, Darren Forrester, in which he dealt with the estate accounts and the financial position of the appellant in relation thereto. This also referred to a payment to the appellant from his father in 2009 of &#163;300,000, which he says was for consideration, namely to avoid a claim in respect of a sale of his property by his father, and so was a potentially exempt transfer for inheritance tax purposes. However, this was not accepted by HMRC. The respondents&#8217; case was set out by Mr Forrester as follows:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">According to the most recent set of estate accounts for the English estate approved by the Executors (but not by the Claimant), as at 14 December 2021 the Claimant&#8217;s share of the English estate was calculated to be &#163;300,390.59. However, when his liability to the estate for Inheritance Tax plus interest on the failed potentially exempt transfers to him (&#163;281,994.04), and the Court-ordered costs mentioned above (total &#163;115,959.22, without the inclusion of interest) is deducted from his share, his total liability to the estate as at 14 December 2021 was &#163;397,953.26. When set off against his share of the estate, the Claimant owed &#163;97,562.67 to the English estate as at 14 December 2021. If interest on the total of the Court-ordered costs was included, his liability to the estate would increase to &#163;145,128.95 at that date. Since the last accounts, the estate has paid further administration costs (some of which have been brought about by the Claimant&#8217;s correspondence and actions), so reducing his share of the English estate and thereby increasing his net liability to the estate. The current estimate of the Claimant&#8217;s share of the English estate is &#163;295,584.85. Deducting the Inheritance Tax plus interest, and the Court-ordered costs (without interest) would leave the Claimant indebted to the estate in the sum of &#163;102,368.41.&#8221;</p>

He disputed the respondent&#8217;s figures, but for the purpose only of his application for distribution was prepared to proceed on the basis of those figures. He referred to movables under the Spanish law of succession and set out tables on various scenarios. Even on the respondent&#8217;s figures, he argued that he was due &#163;283,139.50 including interest but excluding movables, inheritance tax and the potential exempt transfer. However, if these latter matters were taken into account, he argued he is owed &#163;357,837.26.</p>

The will predates the coming into force of the 1984 Act and so refers to inheritance tax by its former name of capital transfer tax. Nothing turns on that change of nomenclature in the present case.  By clause 3, certain jewellery was given to trustees in trust for the benefit of all four children equally. By clause 4 all other property situated in England was bequeathed to the trustees for sale and conversion. From the proceeds, the trustees were required by clause 5(i) to pay all debts in England and funeral and testamentary expenses, if in England, and all capital transfer tax in respect of the estate and legacy situated in England. </p>

The will is silent on the question of how the inheritance tax attributable to the estate (as opposed to the secondary liability for the failed potentially exempt lifetime transfers) should be divided between the residuary beneficiaries. Section 41 Inheritance Tax Act 1984 has the effect that no inheritance tax should be borne by an exempt beneficiary. The case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re Ratcliffe, Homles v McMullen</span> [1999] STC 262 indicates that in the circumstances of this will, the burden falls on the non-exempt residuary beneficiary, namely Mr Changizi, and is therefore due from his share of residue.&#8221;</p>

He failed to pay the tax which created a secondary liability on the part of the executors pursuant to section 199(2) and section 204(8) of the 1984 Act. When the executors were in a position to do so they paid the tax for which Sharas had primary liability together with accrued interest.</p>

It is, however, unnecessary to make any findings about Sharas&#8217; various assertions because the executors paid the tax and interest on the basis of Sharas&#8217; repeated assertions that the payment by his father was a gift to him. They were obliged to do so on the basis of the information they had at the time and no criticism can be made of them for doing so. For the purposes of this application, it is right to treat the payment of tax and interest by the executors as properly made. It follows that Sharas is liable to the estate for the sum it has paid to HMRC namely Inheritance Tax of &#163;129,476.40 and interest of &#163;9,499.15.&#8221;</p>

If this figure - &#163;138,975.55 &#8211; were used instead of the total amount of Inheritance Tax paid by the estate - &#163;281,994,04 - the Appellant has calculated that this would leave a balance in favour of the Appellant from the estate of &#163;41,412.88. If that is right, it means that the estate will have effectively been paid the costs orders by deduction from the Appellant&#8217;s share and he owes nothing further to the estate. The conclusion that the costs orders are outstanding and therefore these proceedings are an abuse could be therefore undermined.

I am not able to find that it does and, accordingly, I do not feel bound to follow it.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appellant now seeks to rely on Re Benham, a point which he accepts he did not take before the judge. As the appellant submits, these authorities differ from the present case, in that they were considering whether inheritance tax should fall only on the non-exempt gifts, so that in effect they became unequal notwithstanding the clear wording of the gifts. </p>

I respectfully agree that Re Benham lays down no principle, and that I should follow Re Ratcliffe. That is what is directed by the clear wording of section 41. The statutory provision means that none of the tax attributable to the value of the residue shall fall on the exempt share of the appellant&#8217;s mother.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In a standard case, therefore, grossing up will not apply. Re Benham was a special case on its facts. There is, however, no reason why the testator cannot include an express Benham clause, to the effect that the shares of the beneficiaries not qualifying for exemption are deemed to be of an amount which after payment of tax is equal to that of the shares of beneficiaries qualifying for exemption. Conversely, the testator could include an express Ratcliffe clause to the effect that the share of a beneficiary not qualifying for exemption shall bear its own tax. Such express provision will remove any doubt as to the incidence of tax.&#8221;</p>

The appellant has not done this and given his witness statement in 2012 and the various statements he has made that the &#163;300,000 was a gift, the respondents have been in no position to make such a request.</p>
