	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The claimant in the employment tribunal complained of unfair dismissal and disability discrimination in respect of her dismissal, following a disciplinary process, in 2021.  At a preliminary hearing the tribunal determined that she was not a disabled person at the relevant time and dismissed the disability discrimination claim.  The claimant appealed.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The claimant had been diagnosed with Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD) in 2010.  This is a chronic condition and the respondent accepted that it was an impairment which the claimant still had at the time of the dismissal.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The tribunal found that in 2021 the claimant&#8217;s condition was, and had been for some years, quiescent, and that during that period it did not have a substantial adverse effect on her ability to carry-out normal day-to-day activities.  Bearing in mind the high threshold for a perversity challenge, that conclusion was not, as such, perverse.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">However, schedule 1 paragraph 2(2) </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Equality Act 2010</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> provides that if an impairment ceases to have a substantial adverse effect on a person&#8217;s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities, it is to be treated as continuing to have that effect if that effect is likely to recur.  The tribunal&#8217;s conclusion that this provision did not apply at the relevant time was not properly reached and/or explained, having regard to the low threshold in law for this paragraph to be satisfied, and the evidence which the tribunal had about the particular nature of the claimant&#8217;s condition.  The definition of &#8220;substantial&#8221; in section 212 of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">2010 Act</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">, </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">SCA Packaging Limited v Boyle</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> [2009] UKHL 37; [2009] ICR 1056;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> and </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Swift v Chief Constable of Wiltshire Constabulary</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> [2004] ICR 909</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> considered.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The conclusion that this aspect of the tribunal&#8217;s decision was unsafe was reinforced by the fact that in this case there had been no case-management hearing, and there appeared to have been no judicial consideration given prior to the preliminary hearing, as to whether a medical report specifically directed to the &#8220;likely to recur&#8221; issue might be warranted in this case.</span></p>

She gave her account of events that followed, leading ultimately to her dismissal.</span></p>

It accepted that the claimant had been notified by the Government that she was advised to shield during the Covid-19 pandemic, and that she had existing health conditions.  But it said that she had failed to identify the impairment that she relied upon as a disability for the purposes of the proceedings.  It requested that she provide medical evidence and an impact statement to enable it to consider its position on disability.</span></p>

The claimant refused such tests, which led to a disciplinary process, in which her concerns were ventilated, investigated, and responded to, and to her dismissal. It maintained that she was fairly dismissed for conduct.  It did not admit disabled status.  In any event it disputed disability discrimination, and contended that the claimant had failed to particularise her disability-discrimination complaint.</span></p>

She subsequently provided three impact statements.  She referred to having being diagnosed with Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD) in </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">2010.  The tribunal summarised what she had written, in particular about the effects and impacts of the condition on her activities.  That included stating that she had problems with walking, due to pain in her knees, standing to prepare a meal, normal household work and carrying shopping.  However, the tribunal also referred to her having in cross-examination &#8220;rowed back somewhat from her impact statement&#8221;.  </span></p>

He recorded her description of what bad days were like.  He stated that she tended to manage at work as best she could, but when her pain was particularly prominent she was unable to attend work. He stated that the claimant was &#8220;likely to fall under the remit of the Equality Act 2010 in relation to disability.&#8221;  The second report, by Dr Brown, from April 2017, indicated that the claimant had been without treatment for the condition since 2015.  He considered that her physical disability &#8220;does seem to be minimal&#8221; and that, when not experiencing a flare up, it had &#8220;minimal effects on function&#8221;.  He considered her fit to carry out various physical tasks associated with her work.  He suggested however that further details might be requested from her rheumatology specialist.  </span></p>

From those records Dr Gupta noted that in fact &#8220;the Claimant has been without any treatment for mixed connection tissue disorder since 2015. From her clinical letters over that period of time, the disease appears to be stable without reporting any flare ups.&#8221; Dr Gupta further stated, &#8216;The most recent time that [the Claimant] was seen at the Rheumatology Clinic was in January 2017 by the Specialist Rheumatology Nurse. [The Claimant&#8217;s] disease was stable and quiescent and she was not on any treatment.

Otherwise, she is feeling very well and we both agreed to reschedule her appointment in six months&#8217; time. If Ms Roofe has any queries she can contact our helpline with the numbers at the top of this letter.&#8221;</span></p>

However, the Claimant has to prove that as at April and June 2021 these effects were likely to recur. In this respect the Claimant&#8217;s evidence in the form of her impact statements was clearly inconsistent with the documentary evidence. Further the Specialist Rheumatology Nurse (referred to in Dr Gupta&#8217;s letter) described the disease as being quiescent in January 2017 - which means dormant - and there was no evidence that during the period relevant to the Claimant&#8217;s dismissal from April to June 2021 this was likely to change. Indeed the Claimant did not appear to have had any meaningful contact with the Rheumatology Department for more than two years after her telephone consultation on 14 May 2020. </span></p>

Further, Dr Gupta, who did see some medical evidence, stated in his letter of 17 August 2017 that there had been no reported flare ups in the Claimant&#8217;s disease since 2015 and that in January 2017 the Specialist Rheumatology Nurse had described the Claimant&#8217;s MCTD as stable and quiescent.

Further I am not satisfied that as at the period April to June 2021 that substantial adverse effect was likely to recur. By that time the disease had been dormant for a number of years and there is no medical evidence before me to suggest it was likely to recur. The Claimant&#8217;s situation is different from somebody who has cancer; cancer is specifically stated to be a disability under paragraph 6(1) of schedule 1 to the Equality At 2010 whereas it is incumbent on the Claimant to prove that her MCTD amounted to a disability for the purposes of the Act and for the reasons given I am not satisfied she has done. I would add that in this respect, the fact the Claimant received a letter from the Government requiring her to shield during the Covid-19 pandemic is not evidence she satisfies (or satisfied at the relevant time) the requirements of the Equality Act as regards disability.</span></p>

Then, following the provision by her of three impact statements, a further letter from the tribunal of 10 August 2022 asked whether she had any medical evidence to support her claim.  The notice of PH indicated that the issue for consideration at that hearing would be whether her disability discrimination claim should be dismissed because she did not have a disability.  What there was not in this case was any case-management hearing at which the claims and issues might have been considered and discussed with the parties.  I have therefore considered whether it might be said that it should have been apparent from the materials presented to the PH judge, that a complaint of discrimination by reference to past disability was being advanced.  </span></p>

The decision is on this point is unsafe, because, if she did not do that, then she substantively erred in law, or if she did, then she did not sufficiently explain her reasoning on this aspect.</span></p>

At the direction of a judge the tribunal then wrote to the claimant on 14 March 2022 directing her to produce an impact statement.  The letter set out the headline definition of disability in section 6(1) and contained a link to further guidance.  It gave examples of day-to-day activities and set out a series of questions to which the claimant was required to respond in her statement.  These included a number of questions designed to elicit evidence from her on topics which reflected various of the more detailed aspects of the legal definition set out in schedule 1, including whether the condition relied upon by her had fluctuating effects.</span></p>

The directions set out in the 14 March 2022 letter, plainly based upon a standard template, were well thought-out, clearly expressed in a manner designed to be accessible to a lay person, and designed to elicit relevant information and disclosure.  They might have proved to be all that was needed.  In particular, it is the common experience of tribunals that, where disability is not initially admitted, once an impact statement, and existing medical evidence, have been provided, this may be sufficient to persuade a respondent to admit disabled status as such.  In many cases, even where a dispute remains, the tribunal may conclude that no useful purpose would be served by seeking further bespoke medical or expert evidence.</span></p>

In such cases, particularly involving litigants in person, proactive judicial management may be needed to tease out the issues, examine whether further evidence might be reasonably required to assist the tribunal to determine them, and consider the options for obtaining such evidence, having regard to cost and other practicalities.  Such an exercise could, potentially, be carried out on paper, but will usually be most effectively and efficiently conducted at a case-management hearing.</span></p>

A case-management hearing would have provided an opportunity for this to be explored, and for the tribunal to consider, for example, whether a bespoke report should be requested from the claimant&#8217;s rheumatologist, or an independent expert or experts, and what the practical possibilities might be.  However, that did not happen, nor were any further paper directions along such lines given, at any point prior to the PH.</span></p>

However, I do not think it realistic to suppose that she could, as a litigant in person, be expected to spot the possible need for, or utility of, such bespoke evidence on a point of law of this type.   Nor do I consider that a judge would, by proactively raising or exploring this possibility, be inappropriately stepping in to the arena.  The purpose would be simply to ensure that a party had a fair opportunity to present evidence that might be relevant, and reasonably required to resolve the issues, and/or to ensure that, so far as practicable, the tribunal had the relevant evidence before it that might be necessary.</span></p>

The judge at that PH had to deal with the matter as she came to it.  But I note that the claimant was clearly advancing a case that it was inherent in the nature of her condition that adverse effects were likely to recur, and the judge recorded at [13] that she submitted that &#8220;further medical information should be sought, particularly from her Rheumatologist&#8221;.  Further, at [18] the judge observed that &#8220;[d]espite the Tribunal&#8217;s order of 14 March 2022&#8221; the claimant had not provided any medical evidence to support her claim to be disabled other than the letter from the Rheumatology Department of 14 May 2020.  But if this was a gap, it &#8211; potentially &#8211; might have been filled, had there more been more proactive judicial consideration of the particular issues arising in this case, and the kinds of medical evidence that might be relevant and reasonably required to determine them.</span></p>

But its conclusion that schedule 1 paragraph 2(2) was not satisfied, was not properly reached and/or sufficiently explained.

While I do not doubt that, if it came back to her, EJ S Moore would consider the matter conscientiously, it would appear to me that there is no particular advantage in this issue, which is a narrow one, going back to her; and it would benefit from being considered by a fresh pair of eyes.
