Such an application may be considered at a series of meetings of the local authority or its planning committee before a final decision is made on it. The issue is whether a provision in a local authority&#8217;s constitution, in the form of standing orders adopted by it, which restricts voting by members at the final meeting to decide the application to those who had been present at the meeting or meetings at which the application had previously been considered, is lawful.</p>

The operation of the restrictive voting rule, however, had the result that at the final meeting of the Council&#8217;s planning committee at which the decision was taken there was a majority in favour of granting the application. The objectors contend that the restrictive voting rule in the standing orders was adopted by the Council unlawfully, with the consequence that the decision on the planning application has been taken unlawfully and the outcome of that application remains to be determined.</p>

This includes the Committee, since the determination of planning applications is a non-executive function: see Schedule 1 to the Local Authorities (Functions and Responsibilities) (England) Regulations 2000.

More significantly, it is likely that the members of the Committee would have been aware of the restrictive voting rule in the relevant standing orders and as a result those members who had not attended the meeting on 27 April may have thought there was little point in them attending the meeting on 14 September, as they would not be able to vote on the application. The parties are agreed that if the relevant standing orders were unlawful and invalid, it cannot be assumed that other members of the Committee would have chosen not to attend the meeting on 14 September and it cannot be assumed that the outcome of a vote on the application would have been the same. It should be noted that had the votes been equal, the Chair, who in fact voted against the application, would have had the casting vote. </p>

The power in para 42 of Schedule 12 for a local authority to make standing orders &#8220;for the regulation of their proceedings and business&#8221;, and the power in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref> to make standing orders, supplement rights and restrictions in the legislation governing the operation of local authorities and do not include the power to prohibit councillors who are committee members from voting, since their right to do so is itself a feature of that legislation. He contends that this interpretation is supported by provisions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/42" uk:canonical="1989 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>, which affirm the importance of the right of a councillor who is a member of a local authority committee to be able to vote on matters to be decided by that committee in order to maintain proportional representation of political groups with respect to &#8220;seats&#8221; on that committee; and by the definition of a &#8220;seat&#8221; in para 4(1) of Schedule 1 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/42" uk:canonical="1989 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> (para 9 above) which shows that a person who holds it is to be entitled to vote at meetings of the committee on any question which falls to be decided at such a meeting.

He points out that an important feature of the context for the LGA 1972 is that the members of a local authority are elected by their constituents to represent them in carrying on the affairs of the authority, which they do by voting on matters which come before the authority or any committee of the authority on which they serve. It would be a strong thing for an elected councillor to be disenfranchised by being prevented from voting and thereby disabled from fulfilling the representative role to which they have been elected and appointed, since that would constitute a form of indirect disenfranchisement of the constituents whom they are in place to represent. The general language used in para 42 of Schedule 12 and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> of the LGA 1972 to confer power on a local authority to make standing orders cannot be taken to include the power to achieve such a result.

First, para 39 of Schedule 12 (para 5 above), as applied to local authority committees by para 44, states in positive terms that, &#8220;[s]ubject to the provision of any enactments (including any enactment in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">this Act</ref>)&#8221;, all questions coming before a committee &#8220;shall be decided by a majority of the members [of the committee] present and voting thereon at a meeting [of the committee]&#8221;. This shows that a committee member&#8217;s right to vote on matters coming before the committee is a fundamental feature of the legislation, which means that it could only be restricted or removed by a statutory provision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In support of this, Mr Harwood relies on the judgment of Scoffield J in the Northern Ireland High Court in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Hartlands (NI) Ltd&#8217;s application for judicial review </span>[2021] NIQB 94 (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Hartlands</span>&#8221;), a case concerning section 30 of the Planning Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 (&#8220;the 2011 Northern Ireland Act&#8221;). The basic statutory regime governing decision-making by local authorities in Northern Ireland set out in the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 2014 (&#8220;the 2014 Northern Ireland Act&#8221;) is equivalent to that in England under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref>, and the 2011 Northern Ireland Act supplements that regime. Mr Harwood says that section 30 of the 2011 Northern Ireland Act is similar to para 42 of Schedule 12 and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> of the LGA 1972 and that the judgment shows that a councillor&#8217;s right to participate in council business cannot be abrogated by a standing order adopted by a local authority.</p>

However, it falls to be located in the wider context of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref>, the provisions of which enable the authority or its committees to take effective and lawful action. A local authority&#8217;s ability to take effective and lawful action is in the interests of all the people in its area and is the mechanism whereby all councillors are enabled to represent the interests of their constituents and the public residing in the authority&#8217;s area, subject to well-recognised limits.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Quite apart from any statutory restrictions on the ability of councillors to vote on particular matters, there is a set of rules which originated in principles of impartiality and fair-dealing identified by the courts and which are so fundamental that they are implicitly reflected in legislative provisions such as para 39 of Schedule 12. A councillor may not vote upon a matter if, for example, they are biased or give an appearance of bias, or have a predetermined view, or have a pecuniary or other personal interest in the outcome: see, eg, <span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for the Environment, ex p Kirkstall Valley Campaign Ltd </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 3 All ER 304" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 3 All ER 304</ref>, 321; <span style="font-style:italic">Bovis Homes Ltd v New Forest District Council </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2002/483" uk:canonical="[2002] EWHC 483 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWHC 483 (Admin)</ref>, paras 111-112. These general disqualifying rules extend significantly beyond the specific statutory disqualifications from voting contained in primary legislation referred to in para 39 above. The legal consequence if a councillor does vote in the circumstances where the general rules apply (at any rate, where that has a material bearing on the outcome) is that the decision taken by the local authority is unlawful and liable to be set aside. </p>

Further, if a vote takes place involving that councillor where such circumstances exist, with the effect that the decision is rendered unlawful, the outcome will be that the local authority or the committee has been disabled from making an effective lawful decision, which would be contrary to the intended scheme of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref>. Where that is the result, all the residents in the local authority&#8217;s area are in practice indirectly disenfranchised, in that they are disabled from being represented by the authority by its taking a valid decision for their benefit.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Harwood submitted that in that situation the law simply leaves it to the judgment and conscience of the individual councillor as to whether to participate in the decision or to decline to vote, and if they fail to stand down from participating in the decision an objector could apply to the court to have the resulting decision set aside. But this would not solve the problem that the collective body would have been disabled by the stance of the individual member from taking a legally valid and effective decision as Parliament intended it should be able to do. Parliament cannot be taken to have intended to let the principle of effective action by the local authority, to which the decision-making structures in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref> are directed, to be dependent on the good conduct of an individual councillor in this way. Rather, as explained below, the chair of the meeting is entitled to call for a vote of those members who are not in fact disentitled by the relevant general background rules from participating in the decision. The chair is thereby able to uphold the effectiveness and lawfulness of the collective decision-making process.</p>

Sedley LJ correctly pointed out that what is at stake in this context is not a right conferred on an individual councillor in the full sense of that term, as something intended to be completely protected from any type of interference; nor an individual right of a fundamental character such as could justify the application of the principle of legality in construing that provision. Rather, if the language of rights is to be used, the rights are those of everyone in the local authority&#8217;s area who look to the authority to take effective and lawful action for their benefit according to appropriate procedures for its collective decision-making.

In <span style="font-style:italic">Armstrong-Braun</span>, which I consider in detail<span style="font-style:italic"/>below, the Court of Appeal agreed that there could be good reasons for a local authority to adopt a standing order which limited the ability of a councillor to place a matter on an agenda for consideration, thereby limiting his or her ability to vote on it, for example if that was in the interest of enhancing the efficiency or effectiveness of the local authority&#8217;s dispatch of the full range of business it had to get through.</p>

The applicability of the general background rules is obvious. They are taken as read by Parliament: see, eg, <span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Pierson</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] AC 539" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] AC 539</ref>, 573 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson (&#8220;Parliament does not legislate in a vacuum: statutes are drafted on the basis that the ordinary rules and principles of the common law will apply to the express statutory provisions&#8230;&#8221;) and 587-588 per Lord Steyn.

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The purpose of para 39 of Schedule 12 is to stipulate the majority required for a resolution to be carried. An ordinary majority is required rather than unanimity or a special majority, such as is stipulated elsewhere in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref> for certain resolutions: see, eg, sections 74, 245 and 249. Para 39 also provides for the chair of the meeting to have a casting vote. In both respects its original statutory predecessor was section 69 of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, an Act introduced to rationalise the system of government of urban corporations which had previously been governed under individual charters (see Rosemary Sweet, <span style="font-style:italic">The English Town, 1680-1840: Government, Society and Culture</span>, 2014, p 153). Neither the 1835 Act nor any of the statutes which followed it, including the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref>, state that a member has an entitlement to vote. The legislation assumes that they do, just as the common law had previously recognised such an entitlement. Hence it is right to say that such an entitlement is implicit in the LGA 1972. It is not created, nor conferred by, para 39 of Schedule 12. This was not disputed in the courts below. As Morris J said (para 111), the general entitlement for members to vote is assumed by the legislation creating local authorities. In the Court of Appeal, Sir Keith Lindblom said (para 53) it was not controversial that the statutory regime for local government assumes a general entitlement for members to vote.</p>

Para 39(1) codifies the rule that decisions are taken by a majority of the members attending who may validly cast a vote, but does not otherwise limit the power of a local authority to regulate the conduct of meetings by means of standing orders. Power to do that is conferred by para 42 of Schedule 12 and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref>.</p>

In particular, the exercise of the power has to be rational and for a proper purpose within the contemplation of the legislation. The importance of the democratic principle that a councillor should be able to represent their constituents and the public in the local authority&#8217;s area by voting on matters affecting them means that the ambit of a local authority&#8217;s discretion, in terms of what may count as rational or as a proper purpose in this context, is limited to a significant degree so that a form of heightened scrutiny would be appropriate in relation to judicial review of a standing order which limited a councillor&#8217;s ability to vote.</p>

This has long been identified as the position where an individual&#8217;s human rights are in issue, where anxious scrutiny of a decision which interferes with those rights may be called for: see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Bugdaycay </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] AC 514" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] AC 514</ref>, 531 (Lord Bridge of Harwich); <span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Brind </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 1 AC 696" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 1 AC 696</ref>, 748-749 (Lord Bridge) and 751 (Lord Templeman); <span style="font-style:italic">R v Ministry of Defence, ex p Smith </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] QB 517" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] QB 517</ref>, 554-556 (Sir Thomas Bingham MR).

At an early meeting of a planning committee an application may be explained in detail orally by officers and then members of the public may be given the opportunity to speak in favour or against. The point of allowing oral representations in this way is to enhance the quality of the decision-making process in relation to substantial planning applications by assisting committee members to gain a thorough understanding of the issues and to gauge the strength of public feeling about them. It also enhances the legitimacy in the eyes of the public of any decision taken at the end of the day if it is felt that all sides in the debate have had a fair opportunity to put forward their respective cases and that their views have been listened to and taken fully into account by the people making the decision. Enhancement of the decision-making procedure would not be achieved to the degree desired if the final decision on the application could be taken at a later meeting by committee members who had not participated in the earlier meeting and had not themselves heard the explanations by officers and the representations by members of the public. The Council could legitimately take the view that although an absent member might be able to read the notes of the earlier meeting or listen to a recording of it, that would not be a sufficient substitute for being present to listen in person to the representations made at the meeting.</p>

That would tend to undermine public confidence in, and the acceptability of, the ultimate decision. (I say this to emphasise the legitimacy of a local authority adopting such a restrictive voting rule as is in issue in this case, not to suggest that it would be mandatory to do so: it is possible that there might be sufficiently weighty practical reasons to justify not adopting such a rule.)</p>

It does not seem untoward or surprising that the provision should be read as accommodating a similar measure introduced by way of standing order promulgated by a local authority for similar reasons. A local authority is expected to be especially well-attuned to local sensibilities and public concerns in its area, and therefore is well-placed to determine whether a measure like the restrictive voting rule in the relevant standing orders is desirable and justified.</p>

It does not follow that Parliament considered that those were the only matters of sufficient concern in terms of detracting from the quality and legitimacy of local authority decision-making as to be capable of justifying restrictions on voting.

The business of a local authority includes making decisions on planning applications. The proceeding by which a local authority takes such decisions is by a vote of councillors in a meeting (whether of the whole authority or of a duly constituted committee of the authority).

As a matter of ordinary language, the power for a local authority to make standing orders to regulate their &#8220;proceedings&#8221; or the &#8220;proceedings&#8221; of their committees includes the power to regulate the circumstances in which a member will be treated as qualified and entitled to vote.</p>

This indicates that, as already seems clear as a matter of ordinary language, in the LGA 1972 Parliament used the term &#8220;proceedings&#8221; to include matters relating to entitlement to vote in council or committee meetings.</p>

In that case it was argued, among other things, that an Act of the Scottish Parliament which set the franchise for voting in the referendum on Scottish independence had unlawfully excluded persons serving prison sentences, on the footing that the right to vote was a basic or constitutional right which could not be abrogated by a generally worded statutory provision. However, this court held that the right to vote was derived from statute and it was not appropriate for the courts to develop the common law in order to supplement or override the statutory rules which determined the democratic franchise: see para 34, in the lead judgment given by Lord Hodge. Therefore the principle of legality had no application and it was not appropriate to read down the general statutory provision in the manner proposed. The present case is even more remote from the application of the principle of legality, as the right of councillors to vote in relation to the business of a local authority has never been treated as fundamental and incapable of abrogation other than by express statutory wording, but has always been qualified by various rules designed to support and enhance the decision-making process. </p>

This meant that the local authority had the power, in principle, to promulgate the standing order in issue. However, because of the importance of local representative democracy, according to which a councillor is elected as the representative of a local constituency and the public in the authority&#8217;s area, the ambit of the discretionary element in the power conferred is comparatively narrow. It is a discretionary power which ought to be exercised by giving anxious scrutiny to the potential damage to the democratic principle inherent in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref> and weighing that against any reasons in favour of its exercise; and a court will apply a correspondingly heightened standard of review in reviewing whether the power has been exercised properly. As always, the question for the court is whether the exercise of the power is lawful; but the standard of review can be described as heightened because, as a matter of legal substance, by reason of the importance of the issues at stake in this context the parameters of the discretion afforded to the decision-maker are more constrained than would generally be the case. </p>

As a matter of ordinary usage in a statute, a definition does not confer rights or make a substantive change in the law; and this particular definition certainly does not confer an absolute right on a councillor to vote at meetings of a committee on all and any matters arising for its consideration. It does not, for example, override the ordinary disqualifications from voting which apply to all committee members. Nor does it confer a right for a councillor&#8217;s vote to be counted when they are not present at the relevant meeting as required by para 39 of Schedule 12. The definition simply identifies the positions in relation to which the proportionate party representation obligations laid down in the substantive provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/42" uk:canonical="1989 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> are to apply. </p>

There is no good reason to infer that by enacting the relevant provisions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/42" uk:canonical="1989 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> Parliament intended that any different approach should apply at committee level. </p>

The case concerned, among other matters, the procedure adopted at a pre-determination hearing held by a local authority in relation to a planning application, at which representations could be made to the authority by interested parties, pursuant to section 30 of the 2011 Northern Ireland Act. Section 30(2) provided that &#8220;[t]he procedures in accordance with which any such hearing is arranged and conducted &#8230; and any other procedures consequent upon the hearing are to be such as the council considers appropriate&#8221;. The local authority adopted a rule that non-attendance by a councillor at a pre-determination meeting meant that they could not vote on the planning application. This meant that several members of the local authority&#8217;s planning committee were not able to vote on the planning application, which was refused. The developer contended that the exclusion of those members from voting on the application was unlawful.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Considering the 2014 Northern Ireland Act, which sets out the basic decision-making structures for local authorities in Northern Ireland in a manner equivalent to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref> in England, Scoffield J said (para 111) it is a basic premise of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that councillors are entitled to vote in council or in committees to which they have been appointed &#8220;and that the question of whether or not they should vote is, at least in general, a matter for their own individual judgment (subject always to sanction for breach of the Code of Conduct and, ultimately, to electoral accountability for their actions)&#8221;. In the light of that premise, although the question was &#8220;not entirely clear cut&#8221;, he held (para 112) that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2011/20/section/30/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 30(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2011/20" uk:canonical="2011 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2011 Act</ref> did not provide adequate statutory authority for a council to deprive an elected member of their vote and upheld the developer&#8217;s challenge to the refusal decision. The judge said that &#8220;[r]eading <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2011/20/section/30" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 30</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2011/20" uk:canonical="2011 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2011 Act</ref> as a whole, it appears to me that the word &#8216;procedures&#8217; is referring to the practical arrangements for a pre-determination hearing and the conduct of the hearing &#8230; rather than the substantive decision-making process which the council (or committee) will ultimately have to undertake&#8221;. In his view, in this context the right to vote was not a matter of procedure. At para 123 he said, &#8220;[g]enerally, &#8230; where a councillor is to be disabled from voting on a particular issue, one would expect this to be clearly spelt out in statute, as, for example, in section 28(1)(a) of the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 (where the member has a pecuniary interest in the matter being considered)&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, <span style="font-style:italic">Hartlands</span> does not support the appellant&#8217;s case in this appeal. Two points may be made. First, the judge was considering a provision (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2011/20/section/30/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 30(2)</ref> of the 2011 Northern Ireland Act) drafted in materially different terms from para 42 of Schedule 12 and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref>. The latter provisions refer in direct and unambiguous terms to regulation of a local authority&#8217;s own &#8220;proceedings&#8221;, which necessarily includes the conduct of voting where that is the proceeding by which the authority carries out its functions. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2011/20/section/30/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 30(2)</ref>, by contrast, refers to &#8220;procedures&#8221; adopted for a pre-determination hearing on a planning application and &#8220;procedures&#8221; consequent upon such a hearing. In context, the word &#8220;procedures&#8221; is not directed to the internal decision-making processes of the authority, but to the way in which it makes arrangements to fulfil a statutory obligation to involve external third parties in the decision-making process. Since that is the meaning of the word &#8220;procedures&#8221; when first used in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2011/20/section/30/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 30(2)</ref>, it is natural to give it the same meaning when it is used the second time in that provision. Therefore, the judge may well have been correct in his conclusion that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2011/20/section/30/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 30(2)</ref> did not create a power to make the rule in question. It should be observed that the local authority did not purport to make a standing order by using the different power contained in section 37 of the 2014 Northern Ireland Act, which is drafted using equivalent wording to that used in para 42 of Schedule 12 and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> of the LGA 1972 (&#8220;A council must make standing orders for the regulation of the proceedings and business of the council&#8221;). The appropriate analysis if the authority had sought to use that power would have been materially different.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, I would not endorse the wider statements by the judge at para 123 regarding the radical interpretive implications to be derived from the importance of the principle of local democracy. As I have explained, the position is more nuanced than he suggested.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Drawing on <span style="font-style:italic">Hartlands</span>, Mr Harwood submitted that a councillor always has a right to vote on a matter which is before the full council or a committee of which he or she is a member, even if they are disqualified from doing so (for example, by the rules derived from common law or the statutory provisions referred to at para 39 above) and their participation would make its decision unlawful. It is a matter for his or her conscience whether to withdraw or to insist on exercising that right. </p>

It elevates the legal force of the asserted right of a councillor to vote to an unsustainable degree and disregards the context of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref>. If the law says that a councillor is not entitled to vote, that means he or she is not entitled to vote. In that case, the chair of the meeting would be entitled to call a vote of members present other than the disentitled member, and that vote would be valid and effective. The chair does not have a discretion to determine who is entitled to vote in a way which does not correspond to the true legal position, but if in fact a member is not entitled to vote the chair can call for a vote of members who are entitled to do so, excluding that member. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">If there were any doubt about whether a member was entitled to vote their entitlement could be tested in court proceedings. If they insisted that their vote be counted in circumstances where the Council considered that they had no entitlement, the matter can be determined by the court which if necessary could ultimately grant an injunction or prohibitory order to prevent them from doing so; in this way they could be compelled to comply with their responsibilities as a public official. A court can issue prohibitory relief against a local authority which proposes to take a decision which is tainted by illegitimate bias or pre-determination: see, eg, <span style="font-style:italic">R v Amber Valley District Council, ex p Jackson </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1985] 1 WLR 298" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">[1985] 1 WLR 298</ref>, in which Woolf J observed (p 307) that a court has a right to intervene to prevent consideration of a planning application by a local authority in an unfair manner. That principle also covers the position where the local authority (or its committee) wishes to proceed to consider the application in a fair and unbiased way, but that would be prevented by the participation of a biased member or one who has pre-determined the matter in an illegitimate way. The recalcitrant member can be excluded, if necessary by order of the court, so as to allow the local authority (or committee) to proceed to take a lawful decision. Or, more simply, the chair of the meeting could be directed not to count the vote of the disentitled member. A local authority is authorised by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">LGA 1972</ref> to conduct the business before it and it is inherent in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/70" uk:canonical="1972 c. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref> that it should be entitled to do so in a way which is lawful and capable of being defended against legal challenge.</p>

The relevant standing orders in this case can be seen in this light and impose lawful constraints. As Mr Hereward Phillpot KC for the Council submitted, they promote consistent, fair and legally robust decision-making. They obviate arguments regarding pre-determination, bias and so forth which could arise if a councillor voted on a planning application without having heard all the representations in relation to it. If a Committee member proposed to cast their vote in circumstances where the standing orders disqualified them from doing so, the same analysis as in para 87 above would apply. The chair of the meeting could properly disregard their vote so that the relevant decision of the Committee was taken according to the votes of those members who are entitled to cast them. If necessary, the issue could be resolved by the court making an order to achieve that effect. </p>

They did not touch on the membership of the Committee at all; they set out rules defining the circumstances in which a member of the Committee would be entitled to vote. As to the second alternative argument, the sub-delegation argument (para 28 above), the Committee did not purport to establish a sub-committee to determine the planning application. It purported to determine the application itself, but on the basis of the restrictive voting rule set out in the relevant standing orders. The validity of the decision taken must therefore depend on whether that was a lawful course for the Committee to take. As explained above, it was. </p>
