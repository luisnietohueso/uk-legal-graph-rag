The reasons for the removal included allegations of sexual misconduct which had been formally withdrawn under the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2020 (&#8220;the Conduct Regulations&#8221;), on the  basis that there was no case to answer, and other allegations and complaints which had not been proved. On 1 March 2024, he was referred to a third stage meeting under the Performance Regulations, which has been postponed pending the determination of this claim.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At a third stage meeting under the Performance Regulations, the panel must make a finding on the allegation of gross incompetence, but it does not have the power to re-open or review the vetting decision, and so the reason for the allegation of gross incompetence cannot be investigated. Regulation 46 makes provision for a range of outcomes. However, unless some level of vetting clearance is reinstated, dismissal is inevitable.  The Claimant may appeal to the Police Appeals Tribunal, but the Tribunal also has no power to re-open or review the vetting decision. Dismissal will result in inclusion on the Police Barred List which effectively prevents the barred person from obtaining service or employment with any police force for a specified period.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

There was a hiatus when the general election was called and a new Secretary of State appointed. The current Secretary of State informed the Court by letter that no decision had yet been made as to whether such regulations should be made, and if so, in what form, and the outcome of the litigation was likely to inform such consideration.  Revised draft regulations were issued for consultation by the Secretary of State on 15 January 2025, the first day of the hearing in this case.   None of the parties invited me to adjourn, as it was not clear when or if any regulations might be made,  and if so, whether they would apply retrospectively to the Claimant. </p>

In 2017, he applied for a  new role which required a higher vetting level. On 17 August 2017, following an interview by vetting officers, he was granted Management Vetting and Security Check  vetting clearance.  That was due to expire in August 2024. In March 2023, his line manager confirmed that he no longer required vetting at this enhanced level and that Recruitment Vetting  and Counter-Terrorist Check clearance would be sufficient for his role.</p>

The incident in question stems from personal disagreements with [X], the mother of my children. At no juncture did I display aggressive or threatening behaviour. It is my perspective that the allegations may have been influenced by external parties, specifically her colleague and superior, &#8230;. (Line Manager PS &#8230;.). The underlying issue was rooted in my suspicions regarding [X&#8217;s] intimate relationship with [her Line Manager], which I had raised on three prior occasions, two of which occurred while we cohabitated. It was later revealed to me by [X] on numerous occasion when visiting/ collecting my children that it was not she who initiated these allegations, but rather they were prompted by [her Line Manager] and still to this day [X] states it was not her who &#8220;put pen to paper&#8221;(Her exact words).  Additionally, [X] confirmed to me during a visit to collect my children that she had confided in [her Line Manager] regarding Allegation (1). I am led to believe that Allegation (3) was an attempt by [her Line Manager] to leverage a deeply personal matter against me. </p>

Upon reflection, I acknowledge that my responses and attitude may not have reflected the level of professionalism expected. The re-emergence of allegations from the past four years, particularly labels such as 'Rapist', 'Predator', and 'danger to women', which are without foundation, has been deeply distressing for me. These unfounded accusations have taken a significant toll on my mental well-being. Explaining and defending my innocence repeatedly against such serious accusations naturally evokes profound stress and anxiety.

These threats are real, not theoretical. They include people joining the police service who pose an unacceptable risk to women or vulnerable persons who they will encounter while in a position of trust. They also include people seeking to infiltrate the police for their own criminal ends or the criminal ends of their associates (e.g. by obtaining and disclosing information from police systems about rivals or police operations, tipping off criminals about police interest in them and so forth). Importantly, they also include people who are vulnerable to coercion or blackmail, whether because of their close association with criminals, because of something in their private life that they do not wish to be revealed, or because they are financially vulnerable due to being in debt. The opportunities for criminals to seek to corrupt a police officer e.g. through family / friends, social groups (whether online or offline), shared spaces such as the gym etc. are manifold and the ease with which this might be done where the officer has a vulnerability to coercion or blackmail cannot be overstated.&#8221;</p>

The APP sets out a number of triggers for a re-vetting or a vetting review.  These include the expiry of vetting clearances (paragraph 8.49 of the APP sets out the expiry period for each level of vetting, after which a full re-vetting is required); or if adverse information comes to light relating to the officer; or there is a material change in their personal circumstances (paragraph 8.48.4 of the APP). </p>

Nor is there any statutory provision to the effect that vetting clearance is a legal pre-requisite to hold the office of police constable.  The &#8216;Home Office Review-The process of police officer dismissals&#8217; (September 2023) identified the need to &#8220;establish a robust and fair process for removing those who cannot maintain their vetting clearance&#8221; and recommended that the Home Office clearly define a route by which forces are able to remove officers who are unable to hold vetting clearance (p.79).    The draft regulations issued in 2024 and 2025 address these issues in part, but not fully.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, in my judgment, the Defendant&#8217;s powers do not extend to the dismissal of a police officer by reason of withdrawal of vetting clearance.  Dismissal is a matter which should be provided for in regulations made by the  Secretary of State under section 50(3) of the Police Act 1996.  This results in an anomalous situation where officers who do not have basic vetting clearance cannot be dismissed by the Defendant.  In my view, that anomaly could and should be resolved by regulations. Mr Beggs KC did not dispute this analysis.  However, he submitted that the third stage meeting procedure under the Performance Regulations was the mechanism by which a police officer may be dismissed if his vetting clearance has been withdrawn, as he is no longer able to perform his duties.  I shall consider this issue under Ground 4 below. Subject to the issue in Ground 4, Ground 1 succeeds. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was common ground between the parties that the civil limb of Article 6(1) is engaged by vetting reviews with respect to serving MPS officers where the outcome might be the removal of minimum vetting clearance.  That is because a decision to withdraw an officer&#8217;s minimum vetting clearance makes it very likely that the officer will be dismissed from the force and included in the Police Barred List.  Thus, the withdrawal of vetting will have a &#8220;more than tenuous or remote&#8221; link with the loss of the officer&#8217;s office, profession and income. See <span style="font-style:italic">Regner v Czech Republic </span>(application no. 5289/11) (2018) 66 EHRR 9 at [109]; [112]; [119] &#8211; [120];<span style="font-style:italic"> Petrova v Bulgaria </span>[2016] ECHR (application no. 57148/08), at [31] &#8211; [35]; [38] &#8211; [40]; [44] - [45]. </p>

It was sufficient for the engagement of Article 6 that the initial proceedings would be truly dispositive of the civil right determined in the subsequent proceedings, or would at least cause irreversible prejudice in those later proceedings.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Although the Court held, on the facts in that case, that Article 6 did not apply, the principle is relevant here.</p>

Such an interference must be in accordance with the law, in pursuit of a legitimate aim, and necessary in a democratic society, which means that it must meet pressing social need, and be proportionate to the aim pursued. Proportionality falls to be considered at stage 2 of the vetting test when the vetting officer has to consider whether it is appropriate, in all the circumstances, to refuse vetting clearance: see the judgment of Coulson J. in <span style="font-style:italic">R (A) v Chief Constable of &#8216;C&#8217; Constabulary </span>[2014] EWHC 216 (Admin), [2014] 1 WLR 2276, at [32] &#8211; [34], quoted at Judgment/[167]. </p>

In that case, the factual evidence concerning the applicant&#8217;s conversations with other judges was decisive.  The accusations against her were likely to result in removal from office or suspension from duty.  At [198], the Grand Chamber stated that the proceedings were in writing and the applicant did not have an opportunity to make oral representations.  The disciplinary body &#8220;did not hear any evidence from witnesses, although it was not only the applicant&#8217;s credibility that was at stake but also that of crucial witnesses&#8221;, namely, the judges who had made the allegations against her.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">It is plainly necessary that a disciplinary hearing should be fair not least because of the potentially grave consequences of such proceedings for someone in the position of the Claimant. Fairness requires that there be a hearing at which an accused officer has the opportunity to question the witnesses against him where he disputes the factual allegations made by those witnesses&#8230;.&#8221; However a Part 4 hearing is by its nature time consuming and expensive. Unnecessary delay in the disposal of proceedings against officers accused of gross misconduct is not in the public interest. The 2008 Regulations attempt to balance the need for fairness so far as the accused officer is concerned with the public interest in speedy disposal. The Fast Track procedure was created in order to provide a cheaper and quicker alternative where fairness could be achieved without the need for a Part 4 hearing. Where the material facts alleged to constitute gross misconduct are either admitted or are incapable of realistic dispute, then the focus of any hearing should be on whether the facts alleged or incapable of realistic dispute amount to gross misconduct and on any mitigation. It is only in relation to a case where there is no or no realistic dispute as to the facts alleged and/or there is no or no realistic dispute as to any factual evidence relevant to whether the factual allegations constitute gross misconduct that the Part 5 procedure will be fair.&#8221;</p>

It is only in very few cases that a decision-making body is faced with a conflict of evidence which it resolves solely or even primarily on the basis of the demeanour shown by the witnesses. There is usually something else. It may be that the account given by one person is self-contradictory or inconsistent with the account that he or she gave on a different occasion; or doubt may be cast on its accuracy by a document; or one account is supported by the evidence of other apparently credible and reliable witnesses, whereas the other stands on its own; or one account is incredible or at least improbable. In any event, as Lord Bingham of Cornhill said in The Business of Judging (2000), p 9, &#8220;the current tendency is (I think) on the whole to distrust the demeanour of a witness as a reliable pointer to his honesty.&#8221; At pp 9 -13, he developed this view and supported it with references to a number of statements by judges and advocates.&#8221;</p>

They are management decisions which are concerned with the assessment of trust and risk in connection with police duties and powers. Despite this, they have many features in common with disciplinary proceedings &#8211; investigation of allegations which can lead to sanctions including  dismissal &#8211; and the ECtHR in <span style="font-style:italic">Regner </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Petrova </span>has held that vetting withdrawals can engage Article 6. </p>

This lower standard of proof does not require the calling and testing of witnesses in an oral hearing.  I do not accept this submission, for the reasons advanced by the Claimant.  The lower threshold of proof does not automatically translate into a lesser need for fairness. A bare allegation might, on the face of it, amount to grounds for reasonable suspicion, but cease to be so once the allegation has been tested or denied.  Furthermore, the strength of the suspicion and credibility of the information is an essential consideration in the proportionality assessment at stage 2 of the vetting test. </p>

The Administrative Court will be able to assess whether, on the evidence, the decision-maker could properly conclude that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting the conduct in question, under stage 1 of the vetting test. Indeed, it performs this exercise in other contexts: see <span style="font-style:italic">R (Mercury Tax Group) v HMRC </span>[2008] EWHC 2721 (Admin) at [31]; <span style="font-style:italic">R (AB) v Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police </span>[2011] EWHC 3385 (Admin) at [36].

A second complainant, a friend of the first, alleged that, on a different occasion, the police constable had also encouraged her to drink too much alcohol and propositioned her, which she declined.

In such cases the procedures laid down by those regulations should normally be followed. A failure to do so is likely to mean that a dismissal based on the misconduct is unlawful as in Monger. However, where the conduct (or at least the relevant acts) amounting to misconduct is admitted or otherwise not in dispute then it is not necessarily the position that the use of other procedures instead of or in addition to those of the Conduct Regulations is precluded. It is clear from <span style="font-style:italic">Farmer</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic">Strathclyde Police</span> case that it can be lawful to dispense with a probationer's services other than through the misconduct route even when the basis for taking that course is behaviour which could amount to misconduct. The critical question in such a case will be whether the effect of the course adopted is (a) to undermine or subvert the protections provided for a constable accused of misconduct or (b) amounts instead to the legitimate use of a different power for its intended purpose. The lawfulness of the action will depend on both the particular circumstances and the particular procedures which are being used. In relation to the former the presence or absence of a factual dispute will be of great significance and is normally likely to be determinative. As to the latter there will need to be close analysis of the nature and purpose of the powers being used.&#8221;</p>

Moreover, and significantly the Vetting Code of Practice and the APP to which the Defendant was required to have regard called for the review to be undertaken in these circumstances. For such a review to be undertaken properly it could not simply mirror the outcome in the misconduct proceedings but had to be a genuine review of the vetting clearance having regard to all the considerations relevant to such a review. Although there is force in the Claimant's point that primacy should be accorded to the conclusion reached in the misconduct proceedings as to the measures necessary to maintain professional standards and public confidence it cannot outweigh the factors in favour of lawfulness. In particular it cannot prevail against the fact that the requirement that there was to be a review of the Claimant's vetting clearance is strongly indicative that this was to be a full and not an attenuated review. The Claimant did not go as far as to say that there should not be a review but her case amounts to saying that the only lawful outcome of such a review in these circumstances would be for her recruitment vetting clearance to remain in place. That would render the review a pointless exercise in circumstances such as those of the Claimant and, indeed, in most cases where the constable in question does not have an enhanced vetting clearance. The APP requires the review to be undertaken whenever misconduct proceedings result in a written warning or a final written warning. If the Claimant's position is correct that means the APP requires an exercise to be undertaken in all such cases even though in very many of them that exercise will be pointless. The unlikelihood of the APP being intended to have that effect strongly indicates that the review called for by section 8.50.1 was to be a full review not constrained by the outcome of the misconduct proceedings.</p>

That, however, was not because the vetting or regulation 13 processes unlawfully subverted the outcome of the misconduct proceedings but instead because those processes were applied properly and by reference to the criteria applicable and relevant to them in the particular circumstances. It follows that the Vetting Decision was not unlawful even though it led to the discharge of the Claimant.&#8221;</p>

That was another case concerned with an enhanced criminal record certificate (&#8220;ECRC&#8221;) and the disclosure of information. It was concerned with the sort of information caught by section 115(7)(a) of the Police Act 1997 which, as Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury MR said at para 77, could include information which either was not relevant or only peripherally relevant but which would unfairly blacken the applicant&#8217;s name, unjustly prejudice her prospects of obtaining the post, or simply embarrass her. The issue was whether the information &#8220;ought to be included&#8221;, which provided the requisite balancing exercise. Lord Neuberger MR went on, at para 81:</p>

		      <content>
			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.38in">&#8220;Having decided that information might be relevant under section 115(7)(a), the chief officer then has to decide under section 115(7)(b) whether it ought to be included, and, in making that decision, there will often be a number of different, sometimes competing, factors to weigh up. Examples of factors which could often be relevant are the gravity of the material involved, the reliability of the information on which it is based, whether the applicant has had a chance to rebut the information, the relevance of the material to the particular job application, the period that has elapsed since the relevant events occurred, and the impact on the applicant of including the material in the ECRC, both in terms of her prospects of obtaining the post in question and more generally.&#8221;</p>

The determination in the misconduct proceedings should be respected and accorded primacy.   So, in this case, the vetting officers should have made their assessment on the basis that, in the light of the findings of no case to answer, there were no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the Claimant committed the rapes as alleged in allegation B (Judgment/[12]) and allegation D (Judgment/[19]), and therefore those allegations should be disregarded.

However, I do not consider that it is fit for purpose. As the panel has no power to re-open the vetting decision, the process deprives the officer of any meaningful opportunity to challenge a finding of gross incompetence.  The panel merely confirms a decision that has already been made, by an internal vetting regime which is not Article 6 compliant. Where basic vetting clearance has been withdrawn, the only outcome open to the panel is dismissal. </p>

These safeguards include a full hearing, where evidence will be considered and witnesses may be called, in which the panel will determine whether or not gross incompetence has been established.  If a finding of gross incompetence is made, before an outcome is determined, the panel must have regard to the officer&#8217;s personal record and any mitigation or references he may put forward, but this is meaningless if the only available outcome is dismissal.  There is a right of appeal to the Police Appeals Tribunal but it will be subject to the same restrictions as the panel. </p>

I anticipate that, in the light of my judgment, and any judgment on appeal, revisions to the Code of Practice and APP will be considered and implemented where appropriate. However, the lawfulness of the non-statutory procedure considered in this judgment may shortly be superseded by a new statutory scheme for vetting.
