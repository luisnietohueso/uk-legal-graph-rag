On 24 February 2021, the Claimant sent some detailed information including 17 headings in the category &#8220;my mitigating circumstances are as follows.&#8221; On 1 March 2021, Miss Walton emailed the Claimant acknowledging that he was not attending the disciplinary hearing, that she would take into account the documents he had mentioned and the points raised in his email 24 February 2021 and the Occupational Health report. The ET dealt with the Occupational Health report dated 22 February 2018 at paragraphs 105 to 106 of the Judgment. She asked the Claimant to supply any further information by 5 March 2021.

Given this issue and the wider context (including the fact that you disclose the chat logs in connection with your own grievance) I considered whether a different sanction, such as a final written warning, may be appropriate. However, on balance I consider that the on-line chat content shows deliberate repeated hateful verbal abuse directed at colleagues, and dismissal is appropriate in the circumstances&#8221;.</span></p>

At paragraph 449, the ET found that the Claimant replied to the appeals officer that he had spoken to the union who had confirmed that they would not be representing the Claimant in his absence and that he had spoken to various healthcare professionals and been advised to disengage with the process and to focus on his mental health. The hearing proceeded in the Claimant&#8217;s absence and the appeal was dismissed. The ET made a finding at paragraph 450 that Mr Marsden, the appeals officer, did so after considering all of the material presented to him. </span></p>

That was a case in which a disabled, wheelchair using employee was dismissed for using offensive and racist language. He was angry about a training course having been arranged at a venue that was not accessible to him and shouted at junior colleagues, including saying that &#8220;the council wouldn&#8217;t get away with it if they said no fucking niggers were allowed to attend.&#8221; The ET dismissed the claimant&#8217;s claims of unfair dismissal and disability discrimination. The ET concluded that the claimant&#8217;s short temper was a personality trait and there was no logical connection between the claimant&#8217;s behaviour and his disability.</span></p>

In concluding otherwise, the Employment Tribunal erred in law.

That qualification does not, however, permit the margin of discretion or range of reasonable responses for which the appellants contend. The presence of the word &#8220;reasonably&#8221; reflects the presence and applicability of the principle of proportionality. The employer does not have to demonstrate that no other proposal is possible. The employer has to show that the proposal, in this case for a full-time appointment, is justified objectively notwithstanding its discriminatory effect. The principle of proportionality requires the tribunal to take into account the reasonable needs of the business. But it has to make its own judgement, upon a fair and detailed analysis of the working practices and business considerations involved, as to whether the proposal is reasonably necessary. I reject the appellant&#8217;s submission (apparently accepted by the EAT) that, when reaching its conclusion, the employment tribunal needs to consider only whether or not it is satisfied that the employer&#8217;s views are within the range of views reasonable in the particular circumstances.&#8221;</span></p>

They heard evidence over 18 days and gave a long and detailed Judgment. The Claimant had not raised this issue in his pleadings which had been prepared with the benefit of legal advice. It was not suggested that he had raised the direct link in his witness statement, nor did he submit that the language itself was directly because of his disability in his written closing submissions for the ET hearing. Although the Claimant had been taken ill at the time of completing his written submissions on 13 December 2022, the matter had been adjourned for two months before oral submissions were heard finally by the ET on 13 January 2023. Further, the Claimant raised nothing about the direct link in his reconsideration application to the ET on 13 July 2023. Although the Claimant had mentioned his alleged Coprolalia condition in support of a direct link within a document headed &#8220;Rejection and Correction of Misleading Response via ET3&#8221;, this document had not been included in the bundle for the ET and the Claimant had not asked for it to be included.</span></p>

The ET correctly identified the seven legitimate aims of the Respondent and accepted at paragraph 1151 that the Respondent did have them. At paragraph 1160, the ET found that dismissal was proportionate in pursuit of legitimate aims 2, 6 and 7 but was not justified in pursuit of legitimate aims 1, 3, 4 and 5 &#8220;without further attempt at warning and persuasion&#8221;. Accordingly, it is clear that the ET did consider options short of dismissal. At paragraph 1155, the ET&#8217;s overall assessment regarding proportionality was that the words used were very strong examples of foul language and abusive towards colleagues. The ET was unarguably correct in finding that this engaged legitimate aims 2, 6 and 7. The ET acknowledged at paragraphs 1154 and 1156.1 that the comments had not been made directly face-to-face to work colleagues, but that dismissal was nonetheless proportionate.</span></p>

Significantly, at paragraph 1159 the ET found that the Claimant had tried to justify his remarks and suggest that they were not abusive and threatening in his submissions to Miss Walton, the dismissal officer. There is no evidence that the Claimant provided any assurance to the Respondent that his offensive remarks would not be repeated. At paragraph 1160, the ET&#8217;s overall assessment was that it was proportionate to dismiss the Claimant for these remarks, notwithstanding some (the ET expressly found two) arose in consequence of his disability.</span></p>
