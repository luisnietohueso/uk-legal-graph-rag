	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This appeal concerns a question on the companies legislation of the Cayman Islands. At the relevant time the legislation was found in Part XVI of the Companies Law (2020 Revision). This has now been renamed the Companies Act and the current version is the Companies Act (2025 Revision) but it has not been suggested that the text of Part XVI (now known as Part 16) has altered from what it was in 2020, and it is convenient to refer to the Companies Act as the legislation now is.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Part 16 (sections&#160;232 to 239A) of the Companies Act contains provisions enabling two or more companies incorporated in the Cayman Islands to be merged or consolidated. Under the procedure laid down by Part 16, such a merger or consolidation normally requires a special resolution of each company concerned. A merger carried out in this way is commonly referred to as a &#8220;long-form&#8221; merger. But where company A is a parent of company B holding shares representing at least 90% of the voting power in company B, the requirement for special resolutions can be dispensed with if a copy of the plan of merger is given to the members of company B. This is commonly referred to as a &#8220;short-form&#8221; merger. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In the case of a long-form merger, members of a constituent company who dissent from the merger have a statutory right to payment of the fair value of their shares, and may, if agreement is not reached with the company, petition the Grand Court for determination of the fair value. These rights can be conveniently referred to collectively as &#8220;appraisal rights&#8221;. The question raised by this appeal is whether shareholders in a short-form merger enjoy similar appraisal rights or not.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case the appellant, Changyou.com Ltd (&#8220;the Company&#8221;), merged with its parent, Changyou Merger Co Ltd (&#8220;the Parent&#8221;), in a short-form merger, sending a copy of the plan of merger to every member of the Company. That included the various respondents. The merger plan provided for their shares to be cancelled in exchange for a cash sum representing US$5.40 per share. The respondents had already notified the Company that they objected to the merger and dissented from it, and subsequently petitioned the Grand Court for determination of the fair value of their shares. A preliminary issue was ordered as to whether members of a subsidiary company that is the subject of a short-form merger are entitled to appraisal rights.</p>

In a judgment handed down on 28 January 2021 he decided the issue in favour of the respondents, holding that they were entitled to payment of fair value, and had taken appropriate steps to dissent.</p>

On 16 September 2022 the Court dismissed the appeal for the reasons given in the judgment of Martin JA, namely that although as a matter of ordinary statutory interpretation appraisal rights were not available in relation to short-form mergers, it was possible to read and give effect to the legislation in a way that made it compatible with section 15 of the Bill of Rights pursuant to the interpretive obligation under section 25 of the Bill of Rights.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel2" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">Part 16 distinguishes between merger and consolidation, the difference being that in a consolidation two or more constituent companies are consolidated into a new company, whereas in a merger the constituent companies are merged, with one of the existing companies being the surviving company: see the definitions in section 232. The present case is one of merger in which the Parent was merged with its subsidiary, the Company, with the Company as the surviving company.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel2" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">Where (as here) all the constituent companies are Cayman Islands companies incorporated under the Companies Act (and limited by shares) the procedure for effecting a merger or consolidation is that set out in section 233. Provision is also made by section 237 for a merger or consolidation between one or more Cayman Islands companies and one or more overseas companies, in which case there are certain further requirements in addition to those in section 233.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel2" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">The ordinary procedure under section 233 consists of the following steps. First, the directors of each constituent company approve a written plan of merger or consolidation: section 233(3). Second, the plan is authorised by each constituent company by special resolution (or other authorisation as specified in the company&#8217;s articles): section 233(6). Third, the plan is signed by a director of each company and filed with the Registrar of Companies together with certain confirmations in the form of a certificate, an undertaking and various director&#8217;s declarations: section 233(9). Fourth, the Registrar (on payment of the applicable fees and on being satisfied that the requirements of section 233(9) have been complied with) registers the plan and issues a certificate of merger or consolidation: section 233(11). The merger or consolidation is effective as from the date the plan is registered by the Registrar (unless, as permitted by section 234, provision is made in the plan for it to be effective on a specified later date up to 90 days afterwards): section 233(13). Pursuant to the undertaking required by section 233(9)(g), a copy of the certificate is then to be given to the members of each constituent company and notification of the merger or consolidation published in the Gazette.</p>

As can be seen, that provides for a member of a constituent company wishing to exercise their appraisal rights (i) to give to the company under section 238(2) written notice of objection &#8220;before the vote on the merger or consolidation&#8221; and (ii) to give to the company under section 238(5) written notice of their decision to dissent within 20 days after the giving by the company of notice of authorisation under section 238(4), with section 238(4) itself requiring that the company give such notice of authorisation within 20 days &#8220;immediately following the date on which the vote of members giving authorisation for the merger or consolidation is made&#8221;. So in the absence of a vote this procedure cannot be operated in accordance with its terms. The question in this appeal is whether this means that minority shareholders in a short-form merger have no appraisal rights such as dissenting shareholders in a long-form merger have, or, if they do, how such rights are to be exercised.</p>

He concluded that section 238(1) conferred the right to be paid fair value on any shareholder dissenting from a merger or consolidation; and that it would be absurd to exclude a dissentient member of a company subject to a short-form merger from the protection of section 238 simply because the member was not allowed to vote. Instead of reading the procedural provisions of section 238 as excluding short-form mergers, they should be construed or read down so as to allow access to the protection of section 238. That could be done by reading section 238 as requiring notice of dissent to be given within 20 days of the copy of the plan of merger being given to the member as required by section 233(7). In the present case the copy of the plan was given to the members by the Company on 13 April 2020 by which time the petitioners (the respondents) had already dissented from the merger. He therefore concluded that the petitioners had taken the appropriate steps to dissent from the merger and had the right to prosecute their petition.</p>

This was that section 15 of the Bill of Rights, which assures a right of peaceful enjoyment of property and permits interference with it only where provision is made by the relevant law for the prompt payment of adequate compensation and access to the Court for determination of the amount, applied; and that it was both possible and appropriate to read section 238 in such a way as to confer appraisal rights on dissenters from a short-form merger.</p>

There was no express definition of what it is to dissent (in contrast, for example, to section 88 which contains in section 88(4) a definition of &#8220;dissenting shareholder&#8221; for the purposes of that section); and hence to understand what it was to dissent one had to turn to section 238(2)-(5) which told one how a shareholder could dissent, and unless a shareholder could dissent in accordance with those sub-sections, they could not dissent at all. To put it another way, section 238(2)-(5) were not merely mechanical; they were definitional and identified the category of person who could exercise the right to payment of fair value.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">These submissions were skilfully advanced but the Board does not accept them. It would require understanding the purpose of section 238 as being to confer appraisal rights on shareholders in a long-form merger but not on those in a short-form merger despite the fact that section 238(1), which is the substantive provision conferring the entitlement, simply refers to &#8220;[a] member of a constituent company incorporated under this Act&#8221; and &#8220;a merger or consolidation&#8221;. There is nothing in section 238(1) itself to limit this to members of a constituent company which is the subject of a long-form merger or consolidation (&#8220;long-form shareholders&#8221;) or to exclude members of a constituent company which is the subject of a short-form merger (&#8220;short-form shareholders&#8221;). Neither in section 238(1) nor in the heading to the section is there any indication or even hint that this is what is meant. If that had really been the intended purpose of the provision one would have expected those responsible for framing the section to have said so, expressly drawing the distinction between long-form shareholders and short-form shareholders. It would seem to be a particularly obscure way of confining the entitlement to long-form shareholders to confer it in unqualified terms on any member of a constituent company  the subject of a merger and leave the exclusion of short-form shareholders to be teased out of the subsidiary provisions in section 238(2)-(5), especially as those provisions themselves do not in terms draw any express distinction between long-form and short-form shareholders.</p>

The Board accepts that these provisions are rather, as submitted by Mr Jonathan Adkin KC (who appeared with Mr Adil Mohamedbhai and Mr Rocco Cecere for the respondents), mechanical provisions. Their purpose is not to provide a definition of what it is to dissent from a merger, but rather to explain how one goes about expressing dissent in practice. That means that &#8220;dissent&#8221; is left undefined by section 238, but it is an ordinary English word whose meaning is not obscure: to dissent from some proposed course of action is to express disagreement with it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This conclusion is supported by a number of other considerations. First, no convincing rationale has been put forward as to why the legislature should have wished to distinguish between long-form shareholders and short-form shareholders in this way. Mr Crow referred us to statements in the Legislative Assembly (as the Cayman Islands legislature, which was renamed Parliament in 2020, was then known), first in 2009 on the second reading of the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009, which introduced the merger and consolidation provisions now found in Part 16, to the effect that their introduction was in response to requests from, and reflected extensive consultation with, the private sector; and then in 2011 on the second reading of the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2011, which amended the provisions, to the effect that it would position the Cayman Islands at the forefront of the financial services market, there having been two rounds of consultation with the industry. There is no reason to doubt that the overall purpose of the legislation was to ensure that the Cayman Islands remained competitive in the market for financial services. But it was not suggested that the consultations in either 2009 or 2011 had given any consideration to whether the appraisal rights should be conferred on all members of merging companies or only on long-form shareholders, and there is therefore no reason to think that such a distinction was introduced at the specific request of the industry or to address some particular competitive concern.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Crow suggested that it might nevertheless have been intended to attract business by making it easier for mergers to take place where a parent had at least 90% of the votes of its subsidiary. But the Board did not find this suggested rationale convincing. In the ordinary case of a long-form merger, the effect of the statutory provisions is that a minority shareholder may find their shares compulsorily converted into other property (including, but not limited to, cash) against their will; but the quid pro quo for this is that such a shareholder is given the appraisal rights conferred by section 238 which entitles them to opt for payment of the fair value of their shares as appraised by the Court (as opposed to accepting whatever payment or other substitute property the directors and majority of the shareholders consider appropriate). That plainly represents what the legislature regarded as striking a fair balance between the ability of the majority to compulsorily take the minority&#8217;s shares and convert them into something else, and the rights of the minority. It is true that in the case of a parent with 90% voting power the legislation contains a derogation in section 233(7) which is evidently designed to permit a streamlined procedure for the implementation of a merger. But the effect of such a short-form merger on minority shareholders is exactly the same as in a long-form merger &#8211; namely that they may find their shares compulsorily taken against their will. It is difficult to see any reason why the legislature should have decided that the quid pro quo for that should be radically different from that available in a long-form merger, as the minority&#8217;s shares in each case comprise the same bundle of rights and the effect of the merger on those rights is the same. Indeed it would mean that a member with a 0.01% shareholding in a company where the majority held 89% of the voting power would enjoy the full appraisal rights; whereas a member with a 10% shareholding in a company where the majority held 90% of the voting power would not. That seems anomalous, and the Board is somewhat doubtful whether such a result would be attractive to those looking to invest as minority shareholders in Cayman Islands companies, or to Cayman Islands companies seeking to attract such investment from the public.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Crow suggested that it was wrong to view the matter solely from the perspective of the investor or minority shareholder, and that viewed from the perspective of a 90% majority owner, it would nonetheless be an advantage to be able to merge with a subsidiary without the trouble and expense of what can be lengthy and costly appraisal proceedings. But again the Board is not persuaded. It was Mr Crow&#8217;s own submission that denying short-form shareholders the full appraisal rights would not necessarily leave them without remedy if the price offered for their shares was demonstrably unfair. They could in an appropriate case challenge the decision of the directors to approve a merger on the basis that they were in breach of their duties to act in good faith in the interests of the company and fairly as between different shareholders; or apply to the Court for the winding up of the company on the just and equitable ground pursuant to section 92(e) of the Companies Act. Indeed Mr Crow at times suggested that denying short-form shareholders appraisal rights in effect did little more than transfer the burden of proof of unfairness to them. (That seems to the Board to overstate matters, as one of the things the appraisal rights give a member of a constituent company is the ability to opt for cash in place of whatever other property their shares are to be converted into, and in such a case there need be no unfairness in the value of what is offered under the merger at all.) As Mr&#160;Adkin pointed out, if dissenting shareholders are able to and do exercise appraisal rights, this does not disrupt or affect the validity of the merger itself; it simply affects what the dissenting shareholders receive in place of their shares. If on the other hand dissenting shareholders in a short-form merger are unable to exercise appraisal rights, that would give rise to greater risks of disruption as the various putative alternative remedies suggested are likely to be more cumbersome and more expensive, and such as to cast doubt on the validity of the merger, or even stop it in its tracks entirely.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, and allied to the first point, is that if the Company&#8217;s submissions were right it would mean that short-form shareholders could have their shares taken away without the same protections as the legislature thought appropriate for long-form shareholders. That seems fundamentally unfair and contrary to the principle of legality under which legislation is not to be interpreted as depriving people of their fundamental rights unless that is clearly and unambiguously stated. One of the rights protected by this principle is the right not to be deprived of property without adequate compensation. Mr&#160;Crow was at pains to point out that on his case it would not mean that a short-form merger could be used to expropriate the shareholders&#8217; property without compensation; under section 233(5) shares could not simply be cancelled but had to be converted into some other property, and the duties of directors would prevent that being done in a deliberately unfair way. He pointed out that in the present case the assessment of the cash to be paid was entrusted to an independent committee who had taken advice and that this had resulted in the price being raised from US$5 to US$5.40 per share. But what was in fact done in the present case cannot affect the principle, and in any event the legislature undoubtedly thought it appropriate that long-form shareholders should have the full appraisal rights. If that is what the legislature regarded as required to fairly compensate long-form shareholders for their shares being taken away, then it is difficult to see why any lesser protection was required to fairly compensate short-form shareholders for the same interference with their rights. This too seems to the Board a reason for being slow to accept the Company&#8217;s submissions.</p>

They must abstain from any course which might have the appearance of judicial legislation. A statute is expressed in language approved and enacted by the legislature. So the courts exercise considerable caution before adding or omitting or substituting words. Before interpreting a statute in this way the court must be abundantly sure of three matters: (1)&#160;the intended purpose of the statute or provision in question; (2) that by inadvertence the draftsman and Parliament failed to give effect to that purpose in the provision in question; and (3)&#160;the substance of the provision Parliament would have made, although not necessarily the precise words Parliament would have used, had the error in the Bill been noticed. The third of these conditions is of crucial importance. Otherwise any attempt to determine the meaning of the enactment would cross the boundary between construction and legislation: see per Lord Diplock in <span style="font-style:italic">Jones v Wrotham Park Settled Estates</span> [1980] AC 74, 105-106.

There is no real doubt as to the general nature of the provision that the Legislative Assembly would have made, namely that it would have provided machinery enabling short-form shareholders to exercise appraisal rights. Mr Crow pointed to a passage in the Chief Justice&#8217;s judgment at para 121 where he identified four options, namely (i) to amend the definition of &#8220;parent company&#8221; in section 232 so as to limit the availability of short-form mergers to wholly-owned subsidiaries; (ii) to delete section 233(7) so as to remove the ability to carry out short-form mergers at all; (iii) to amend section 238 to make it expressly applicable to short-form mergers; or (iv) to adopt a statutory mechanism for some other sort of Court application in a short-form merger. But the Chief Justice was not in this passage considering the third <span style="font-style:italic">Inco </span>condition. He was reciting a submission on behalf of the Company as to the options that would be open to Parliament if the Court were to make a declaration that the legislation was incompatible with the Bill of Rights.

The provisions of section 238(2)-(5) set out a detailed timetable for the exercise of appraisal rights in the case of a long-form merger. It is not obvious how the legislature would have adapted these steps to the case of a short-form merger. Thus for example under section 238(2) the first step is for shareholders to give notice of objection before the vote which confers authority on the merger. There is no equivalent step to the vote in a short-form merger, which moves directly from the directors approving the plan under section 233(3) to a copy of the plan being given to the members under section 233(7). In these circumstances what provision would the legislature have made in a short-form merger in respect of a notice of objection? It could scarcely have required the members to give notice of objection <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the copy of the plan was given to them as this might be the first they heard of it, there being no obligation to notify them in advance. The legislature might have required the members to give notice of objection after the copy of the plan was given to them, but that raises the question of how long after? Or it might have omitted the requirement for members to give notice of objection at all. That might depend on what the purpose of requiring notice of objection in a long-form merger is, something that was touched on in argument but not answered to the Board&#8217;s satisfaction. Similar points could be made on the steps in section 238(4) and (5), as indeed the differing solutions ultimately favoured by the Chief Justice and the Court of Appeal illustrate.</p>

At this stage in the analysis the principles applicable are those of ordinary statutory interpretation, not those applicable to the more expansive exercise permitted or required by constitutional instruments; and to fill in the gaps by devising suitable machinery would be, in the Board&#8217;s view, to cross the line between interpretation and legislation.

By section 1(3) &#8220;government&#8221; includes the Legislature (which by section 59(1) then consisted of Her Majesty and the Legislative Assembly). Mr Crow accepted that for the Legislature to pass a law authorising the Government to acquire a person&#8217;s property compulsorily itself would engage section 15. But the Board does not see why it would not equally engage section 15 if the Legislature passed a law authorising A to acquire the property of B compulsorily. That is just as much an interference by &#8220;government&#8221; in the shape of the Legislature with B&#8217;s peaceful enjoyment of his property. So although the second and third limbs of section 15(1) prevent the Government from itself taking possession or acquiring an interest in or right over a person&#8217;s property, the first limb preventing interference with enjoyment is in the opinion of the Board engaged by the passing of a law which deprives B of his property whether or not the Government acquires an interest in it.</p>

But it would not in the Board&#8217;s opinion prevent B from asking the Court to interpret the legislation in accordance with the interpretive obligations in section 5 of the Constitution Order or section 25 of the Bill of Rights as the case may be (as to which see below), and then relying on the legislation as so interpreted against A.

Thus for example section 15(2)(a) includes the cases of execution of judgments and acquisition of property by prescription or limitation, and section 15(2)(b) includes the administration of estates, administration of assets in insolvency and the vesting of trust property. The fact that all these exclusions are spelled out as they are tends to confirm that section 15 is not limited to cases where property is acquired by the Government but extends to cases where laws passed by the Legislature enable the enjoyment of property to be interfered with by someone else such as a judgment creditor, adverse possessor, executor, liquidator or replacement trustee.</p>

It is a commonplace that a share in a company is a bundle of rights. Such rights, he said, are always subject to the provisions of the constitution of the company in question and the provisions of the company law under which they are obtained. If those provide for the shares to be taken in certain circumstances, that does not interfere with the shareholder&#8217;s rights, as those rights were always subject to that possibility.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">MMI</span> the claimant firm became a member of London Stock Exchange Ltd and was allocated a share in the company on terms that if it ceased to be a member it would transfer the share back for no consideration. Neuberger J (as he then was) considered it almost self-evident that a person could not be said to be deprived of a possession other than subject to the conditions provided by law if the manner and circumstances in which he was so deprived were pursuant to the very agreement under which he acquired the property, or to put it another way, were an integral part of that property (at para 142). In <span style="font-style:italic">Sims</span> the claimant and his wife were joint periodic secure tenants of a house belonging to the defendant local authority where the tenancy agreement provided that if either wished to terminate his or her interest in the tenancy he or she had to terminate the tenancy as a whole. Mr Sims&#8217; wife gave notice to quit and the tenancy terminated. Lord Neuberger (as he had become) said that as Mr Sims had been deprived of his property in circumstances specifically provided for in the agreement which had created it, the argument that this was a breach of article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (&#8220;A1P1&#8221;) was plainly very hard to sustain, accepting a submission that the loss of his right was the result of a bargain he had himself made.</p>

That principle might have been in point if at the time of acquisition by the respondents of their shares in the Company the Articles of Association of the Company had expressly provided for the respondents&#8217; shares to be cancelled in the event of a short-form merger. It might then indeed have been said that such provisions were an integral part of the respondents&#8217; property, and the result of the bargain they had themselves made.

The Court of Appeal held that the agreement mis-stated the amount of credit charged. This had the result that the agreement was wholly unenforceable as the amount of credit was a prescribed term and under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 the failure to state all the prescribed terms prevented the agreement from being enforced.</p>

It was not in the event necessary to decide this point as the House unanimously held that the Human Rights Act 1998, which incorporated the European Convention into domestic law, had no application to transactions carried out before it came into force. But it was considered by most of their Lordships. Their speeches however reveal a considerable range of views on the point. Lord Scott at para 168 took the view that A1P1 was concerned with interference with existing possessions or property rights and that the effect of the 1974 Act was that FCT never acquired any enforceable right at all. Lord Hope at para 107 took a similar view on the basis that the agreement that FCT entered into was from the outset an improperly executed agreement and subject to the statutory restrictions on its enforcement, so that A1P1 was not engaged. He did however say at para 106 that it was a matter for domestic law to define the nature and extent of the rights that a person acquires and continued:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;One must, of course, distinguish carefully between cases where the effect of the relevant law is to deprive a person of something that he already owns and those where its effect is to subject his right from the outset to the reservation or qualification which is now being enforced against him. The making of a compulsory order or of an order for the division of property on divorce are examples of the former category. In those cases it is the making of the order, not the existence of the law under which the order is made, that interrupts the peaceful enjoyment by the owner of his property. The fact that the relevant law was already in force when the right of property was acquired is immaterial, if it did not have the effect of qualifying the right from the moment when it was acquired.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Hobhouse at paras 136-137 considered that the answer depended on whether the car had been delivered to FCT (in which case the 1974 Act would have interfered with FCT&#8217;s special property as pledgee in the car and there would be the basis for an A1P1 complaint), or had remained in the possession of Mrs Wilson (in which case FCT&#8217;s complaint would be that they should have been allowed to seize the car in purported enforcement of a contractual right they had never in fact acquired). Lord Nicholls considered the question at paras 38-44. At para 41 he rejected a submission for the Secretary of State, advanced by Mr Crow in similar terms to that advanced before us, that a person who acquires property subject to limitations under a law which subsequently bite according to their tenor cannot complain that his rights under A1P1 have been infringed; Lord Nicholls considered that the exercise of powers such as powers of compulsory acquisition or property adjustment powers on divorce prima facie<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>engaged article 1, irrespective of whether the enabling statute was enacted before or after the property affected by the order was acquired (at para 42).

In my view, consistently with the underlying objective of article 1 of the First Protocol, the relevant provisions in the Consumer Credit Act are more readily and appropriately characterised as a statutory deprivation of the lender&#8217;s rights of property in the broadest sense of that expression than as a mere delimitation of the extent of the rights granted by a transaction.&#8221;</p>

The UK Government advanced a very similar argument to that advanced before us, namely that there is no interference for the purposes of A1P1 where the relevant law exists at the time the property is acquired and where the operation of the law is to be seen as an incident of the property right at the time of its acquisition (see at para 49). The majority of the Chamber rejected this argument at para 51 as follows:</p>

Whether it does so will depend on whether the law in question is properly to be seen as qualifying or limiting the property right at the moment of acquisition or, whether it is rather to be seen as depriving the owner of an existing right at the point when the events occur and the law takes effect.&#8221;</p>

Even though a person may acquire property subject to existing statutory provisions of this latter type, that does not prevent the subsequent operation of those provisions from constituting an interference with the person&#8217;s rights such as to engage A1P1. The Board does not see any reason to take a different view of what constitutes an interference for the purposes of section 15 of the Bill of Rights, and on this test the fact that the respondents acquired their shares in the Company (assuming they did &#8211; there is no material before the Board as to when they in fact acquired them) at a time when the legislation already provided for the possibility of their shares being cancelled by means of a short-form merger does not prevent the subsequent implementation of such a merger from constituting an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of their property.

On any view they cannot be said to have acquired their shares subject to the possibility of cancellation by means of a short-form merger. Yet the legislation (and in particular section 238) cannot be given one interpretation for them and another for those acquiring their shares after 2009. It is unnecessary for the Board to reach any conclusion on this point, but there would appear to be considerable force in it.</p>

To accept this submission would entail accepting that any law which affected rights under a contract was a law that made provision for interfering with those rights as an incident of the contract, and would therefore fall within the carve-out. That would in effect mean that there would be no limit to the interference with contractual rights that government could legislate for (subject to the proviso at the end of section 15(2)(a)), with the result that the exception would largely swallow the rule, so far at any rate as concerned contractual rights. But contractual rights are often among the most significant of property rights. It is difficult to believe that this is what section 15(2)(a)(iii) was designed to achieve; and given that it is a well-established principle that exceptions in constitutions are to be narrowly construed (<span style="font-style:italic">R v Hughes</span> [2002] UKPC 12, [2002] 2 AC 259, para 35), the Board concludes that it does not have this effect.</p>

If the intention had been to exempt all laws which provided for interference with any contractual rights, then it is not easy to see why this list is included at all. It is noticeable that the last four in the list are all types of security transactions under which the holder of security (mortgagee, chargee etc) may be or become entitled to take possession of the property of the other party (mortgagor, chargor etc) and sell it by way of enforcement of security; that suggests that the purpose of the sub-section was to make it prima facie unnecessary to justify laws that entitle the holders of security to enforce their rights even though doing so will necessarily interfere with the other party&#8217;s enjoyment of their property. Read in that light, the reference to leases and tenancies is no doubt to be understood similarly as intended to make it prima facie<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>unnecessary to justify laws entitling landlords to resume possession of property from their lessees and tenants. The rights of security holders to enforce their security, and of landlords to regain possession of their property, are quite naturally referred to as &#8220;incidents&#8221; of the respective contracts. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;No attempt was made to define what constituted an incident of a contract for the purposes of the section 15(2)(a)(iii) carve-out; but it appears to me that the instances of relationships to which interference may be incidental specified in the same carve-out indicate what the legislature intended. Those instances are leases, tenancies, mortgages, charges, bills of sale, and pledges; and each of them has inherent in it a possibility of forfeiture. Leases and tenancies may be forfeit if the lessee or tenant fails to comply with covenants; mortgages, charges, bills of sale and pledges all give rise to security interests justifying remedies such as foreclosure or sale on failure to satisfy the charge. The possibility of forfeiture may be, but is not always, a term of the contract; but it is always a necessary incident of the relationship and will ordinarily be fortified by legislation and enforced by the courts. The potential for dispossession, which I regard as the common feature of these instances, is capable of being present in other contracts: indeed, it is not unusual for articles of association to contain a provision for the forfeiture of shares if calls are not met. It is not, however, usual to find in articles of association a provision for forfeiture or dispossession in the context of a merger (and there is none in this case); and the possibility of such dispossession cannot be said to be inherent in the contractual relationship between the shareholders embodied in articles of association. Accordingly, in my judgment it cannot be said that dispossession in a short-form merger occurs as an incident of the contract between the shareholders. As I have said, it is solely a consequence of legislative intervention.&#8221;</p>

Mr Crow identified no less than 23 changes to the Companies Law in this period. Of these, 6 consisted of restatements of the law in successive revisions, from the Companies Law (2010 Revision) to the Companies Law (2018 Revision). The other 17 were effected by passing amending legislation, starting with the Companies (Amendment) (No 2) Law 2009 and continuing up to the Companies (Amendment) Law 2019. </p>

Thus many of the laws amending the Companies Law between 2009 and 2020 left Part XVI untouched. The Board does not consider this can be right. The effect of section 5 of the Constitution Order is very far-reaching. It affects the entire corpus of existing law as at 6 November 2009 and requires such laws to be &#8220;read <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">and construed with such modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity with the Constitution&#8221;. In the case of a lengthy law such as the Companies Act (which in its current form runs to 21 Parts and 7 Schedules), that means that each of its Parts as it stood on 6 November 2009 was subject to the requirements of section 5 of the Constitution Order. It would seem very surprising if an amendment to one Part (such as Part 6 which deals with the removal of defunct companies) or even to a single section (such as section 229 which prohibits the issue of bearer shares) could have the effect that Part 16 should no longer be subject to the requirements of section 5 of the Constitution Order, even though such an amendment had nothing to do with merger and consolidation and made no difference either to the text, or the operation, of Part 16.</span></p>

The Board does not doubt the principle as stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Bennion</span>, but does not agree that the suggested consequence follows: the Board sees nothing surprising in a lengthy Act having some provisions which pre-date the appointed day and are subject to section 5 of the Constitution Order and other provisions which post-date the appointed day and are subject instead to section 25 of the Bill of Rights.</p>

Mr Adkin submitted that an existing law that is amended post the appointed day does not cease to be an existing law unless Parliament can fairly be taken, when enacting such amendments, to have addressed its mind to the constitutionality of the law it was amending. The Board does not consider that this can be right either. Quite apart from being objectionable on the basis that the idea that Parliament has a mind is a fiction, it does not provide anything like a workable test in practice. When can Parliament be taken to have thought about the constitutionality and when not? Such a test would be likely to lead to lengthy debate based more or less on speculation, and quite possibly speculation as to the internal workings of Parliament. There must be some simpler and more objective test which can be applied by reference to the substance of the law in question rather than by appeal to what Parliament must have been taken to have considered.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Board was referred to certain decisions on other constitutions, but did not find them of much assistance. In some constitutions, provision is made for existing laws to be immune from challenge on constitutional grounds. In such a case the reference to existing laws should be given a strict and narrow rather than a broad interpretation: see eg <span style="font-style:italic">R v Hughes</span>, para 35, per Lord Rodger. But this is because such a provision is a derogation from constitutional guarantees and is therefore to be narrowly construed on well-known principles: see <span style="font-style:italic">ibid</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>and also <span style="font-style:italic">Worme v Comr of Police of Grenada</span> [2004] UKPC 8, [2004] 2 AC 430, para 34, again per Lord Rodger. Where however a constitution contains a provision designed to bring existing laws into conformity with the new constitutional provisions, this is a &#8220;different, and indeed beneficent, context&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Worme</span> at para 34). In that case the Board of the Privy Council did not need to decide the point but left open the question whether in such a context a narrow construction was appropriate. In the present case the Board considers that since section 5 of the Constitution Order is not a derogation from constitutional guarantees, there is no reason to give it a particularly strict and narrow construction; it should be interpreted in accordance with the evident purpose of the provision, which was to bring existing laws into conformity with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.</p>

This has the practical effect that provisions of a pre-appointed day law that are either not amended at all, or that are amended in immaterial ways, continue to be existing laws and hence continue to be subject to the beneficent requirements of section 5 of the Constitution Order notwithstanding that amendments may be made to other parts of the same law.</p>

But the text, and effect, of section 238(1)-(5) has remained entirely unchanged from the form in which the corresponding provisions (section 251G(1)-(5) of the 2009 legislation) were first introduced before the appointed day.  Therefore, the amendments to the provisions in question are not material.</p>

The Board does not accept this submission. The obligation imposed by section 5 of the Constitution Order is sufficiently broad and cogent to enable the Courts to make the modest changes to section 238(2)-(5) which are required to adapt the machinery there set out to the case of short-form shareholders, as was done both by the Chief Justice and by the Court of Appeal, albeit in slightly different ways. These are &#8220;modifications&#8221; or &#8220;adaptations&#8221; necessary to bring the provisions of section 238(1)-(5) into conformity with the Constitution. The Board is conscious that the precise modifications made by the Chief Justice and the Court of Appeal were not identical. But no argument has been advanced that the Court of Appeal was wrong to substitute its modifications for the somewhat simpler one made by the Chief Justice, and the Board therefore does not address that question.</p>

Mr Crow&#8217;s point was that, as so modified, dissenting shareholders had to give written notice of objection immediately <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> the date on which the plan of merger was given to them, and notice of dissent within 20 days immediately <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> notice was given by the Company that the plan of merger had been filed with the Registrar. The respondents however gave notice of objection and dissent <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the plan of merger was given to them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">When the Company appealed the Order to the Court of Appeal it sought the reversal of the whole of the Chief Justice&#8217;s Order. But, as recorded by the Court of Appeal in its supplementary judgment of 20 December 2022, nothing in the Company&#8217;s Grounds of Appeal, skeleton argument or oral submissions addressed the question whether there had been compliance with the procedural requirements of section 238 or came close to even hinting that the point was or might become a separate live issue. In those circumstances the Court of Appeal refused to allow the Company to raise the issue after its main judgment had been delivered, saying (supplementary judgment at para 8) that:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;&#8230;it is now far too late for it to seek to raise an issue which could (and, if the appellant wished it to be resolved, should) have been raised during the hearing of the appeal. It is incorrect to say, as the appellant does, that it had no opportunity to raise the point until it saw the respondents&#8217; options for amendment (which were only provided after the end of the hearing) or until it received a draft of the judgment: the point was always available on the wording adopted by the Chief Justice. The reality is that the appeal was fought entirely on the question of principle of the availability of appraisal rights in short-form mergers, and the appellant lost that battle.&#8221;</p>

The Board in those circumstances expresses no view on the merits of the Compliance Issue, although the Company&#8217;s position that the respondents had failed to exercise appraisal rights despite the fact that they had clearly notified the Company of their objection and dissent even before the plan of merger was provided to them is not one that appears overly attractive at first sight.</p>
