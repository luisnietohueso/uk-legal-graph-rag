	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant is a 15-year-old boy who on 18 January 2024 was permanently excluded by the Principal from the Academy which he had been attending.  A disciplinary panel of the Governing Body (&#8220;GDP&#8221;) refused to reinstate him. This decision was quashed by an independent review panel (&#8220;IRP)&#8221; which directed the governors to reconsider the case. The GDP&#8217;s decision on reconsideration, recorded in a letter dated 24 June 2024, was that he should not be reinstated.</p>

An expedited one-day hearing was fixed for 24 October 2024 and took place before Fordham J.

After three years at the school, he started Year 10 in September 2023 aged 14. Then, after the autumn half-term in Year 10 &#8211; and within five weeks between 31.10.23 and 5.12.23 &#8211; he was suspended five times. The Academy&#8217;s Behaviour Policy explains that, at the point of a sixth suspension within a year, the Principal will consider permanent exclusion (&#8220;PEX&#8221;) for persistent breaches of the Behaviour Policy. The last three of these five suspensions related to incidents which occurred while he was being parented at home only by his father, while his mother was visiting Nigeria (18.11.23-26.12.23).</p>

He had been given a detention after failure to follow a simple request to move seats, after being given a warning and a countdown. When he received the detention, he repeatedly said to the member of staff "fuck off man". When the member of staff spoke to him to say that he needed to pack up, he continued to say "fuck off man".</p>

When searched he was found to have a lighter and a vape (both prohibited under the Academy's Behaviour Policy). When placed in the Reintegration Room, a supervised room within the Academy for students who have failed to follow the Behaviour Policy, he repeatedly fell asleep.</p>

He had been involved in an incident outside of school, during the school day, and in school uniform, which resulted in the police bringing him to school. The police were called to a local tower block after they had received calls about a group of students throwing roof tiles off of the balcony and smoking cannabis. One roof tile almost hit a resident. No cannabis was found but some students had lighters and other cannabis paraphernalia.</p>

The previous day, he again failed in the Reintegration Room and had been placed outside the Principal's office. The Principal spoke to him for 10-15 minutes in the office to see what the issue was and to run over the Pastoral Support Plan (&#8220;PSP&#8221;) which had been set up (on 1.12.23). He was outside the Principal's office between 10:00am to 3:30pm when he did not write a word and slept at least twice despite the Principal prompting him a number of times.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judge observed that one of the key questions he was asked to consider was about support interventions by the Academy, and whether sufficient time had been allowed before the "last resort" of PEX. The Academy made a Multi-Agency Support Hub (&#8220;MASH&#8221;) referral on 29.11.23, after the incident which led to the third suspension. MASH referrals are addressed in the Academy's Safeguarding Policy, which also describes Early Help (additional help where the needs of a child are beyond the level of support provided by universal services). MASH referrals are "safeguarding" referrals where a child is considered to be "at risk of harm". The referral was made by the Deputy Head of Year, due to the concerns regarding the Claimant being brought by the police, his friendship group outside school, possible drug misuse and the Claimant's parents finding it very difficult to manage his behaviour at home. The MASH referral was picked up within the local authority by Family Early Help (&#8220;FEH&#8221;) and a family early worker (&#8220;FEW&#8221;) was assigned.</p>

After the Claimant was absent on a number of days in the second week of the new term in January 2024, the Head of Year emailed the FEW on 15 January 2024 to check whether they were working with him. The FEW's email response the same day was that "the case was stepped up to Social Care given the safeguarding concerns" and that a social worker had been allocated. The Head of Year emailed the social worker on 16 January 2024 to say that he had advised the Claimant's mother to call the police and report him "missing", adding that:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A PSP had been set up on 1 December 2023. PSPs are described in the Academy's Behaviour Policy. A PSP is a structured and coordinated 16-week school intervention designed to support students at risk of PEX. They are used for students who have received a set number of negative behaviour points or suspensions and who are not responding to other forms of intervention. They are created with the involvement of key staff, parents or carers, the student and any other relevant professionals. Targets are set for a student, using information obtained from their teachers, and are reviewed every 4 weeks. They provide a tailored and structured form of intervention which is regularly reviewed so that progress can be checked and changes can be made. When the Claimant's PSP was set up, an initial meeting took place that day. The attendees included the Claimant, his father and the Academy's Designated Safeguarding Lead (&#8220;DSL&#8221;). The recorded reasons for the PSP were persistent absence from school, including an attempt at running away from school; lack of proactive work in and out of lessons in order to ensure success, the Claimant having shown great work in the past, but having recently shown a lack of interest which had impaired his work in lessons; and poor conduct outside of school, which could be dangerous to himself and would jeopardise his professional success.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The picture regarding support and interventions by the Academy is completed by the following. The PSP recorded the following previous school interventions: Ambition Centre; Football Journeys (Year 9); FutureMen (Year 9); and Khulisa group counselling (Year 8). Football Journeys is a programme where students from different postcodes work together on video projects around what type of person they are in the community and then meet up to play football. FutureMen is a programme specifically tailored to young men at risk of potential gang involvement, criminal activity or criminal exploitation and the Claimant was "profiled" to participate. Khulisa is a programme to prevent PEX brought in for students matching a similar "profile" to the Claimant. In addition, the Claimant had been offered, but had refused, further counselling. The Academy had offered to work with the local authority&#8217;s SAFE task force, with paperwork sent for the parents to sign so that the Claimant could join. The Claimant's father had consented to the referral to FEH and SAFE taskforce. Football Journeys and the SAFE Taskforce are described in the Academy's Behaviour Policy as examples of pastoral interventions. Home visits had been carried out from November 2023 onwards.</p>

There is a friend that lets the group enter a building where they smoke weed and use canisters at the same time. (I'm interpreting this as NO [nitrogen oxide] canisters). This has been shared in videos on snapchat but we have not seen it. Some students are from our school, but many are not. Today he arrived at 9.30am.

His father and mother were contacted by the Assistant Principal for Behaviour (&#8220;APB&#8221;). The Claimant's mother came into the Academy. There was a discussion and then a physical altercation between mother and son. That was de-escalated. The Claimant indicated that he had drugs in his possession and was found to be in possession of a bag of cannabis in a foil packet, rizla papers, a lighter, a vape and &#163;270 in cash. Drugs are banned under the Academy's Disciplinary Policy, as are lighters and vapes. The Claimant was asked about the cash and said he was holding it for a friend to buy a jacket. When she was then asked about the cash, the Claimant's mother stated that she had given him the money for a jacket.</p>

However, on 22 February 2024 the Claimant was arrested in the community for possession of a Rambo knife. The second Academy was made aware of this and because of concerns associated with &#8220;bringing the school&#8217;s reputation into disrepute&#8221;, the managed move failed.

CCE is where an individual or group takes advantage of an imbalance of power to coerce, control, manipulate or deceive a child into any criminal activity in exchange for something the victim needs or wants, and/or for the financial or other advantage of the perpetrator or facilitator and/or through violence or the threat of violence. The victim may have been criminally exploited even if the activity appears consensual. CCE does not always involve physical contact; it can also occur through the use of technology. CCE can include children being forced to work in cannabis factories, being coerced into moving drugs or money across the country (county lines), forced to shoplift or pickpocket, or to threaten other young people. Some of the indicators of CCE are: children who appear with unexplained gifts or new possessions; children who associate with other young people involved in exploitation; children who suffer from changes in emotional well-being; children who misuse drugs and alcohol; children who go missing for periods of time or regularly come home late; and children who regularly miss school or education or do not take part in education. Any possible CCE case will be shared with the DSL with a view to referring to appropriate agencies following the referral procedures.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">County Lines. Criminal exploitation of children is a geographically widespread form of harm that is a typical feature of county lines criminal activity: drug networks or gangs groom and exploit children and young people to carry drugs and money from urban areas to suburban and rural areas, market and seaside towns. Key to identifying potential involvement in county lines are missing episodes, when the victim may have been trafficked for the purpose of transporting drugs. Like other forms of abuse and exploitation, county lines exploitation can affect any child or young person (male or female) under the age of 18 years; can still be exploitation even if the activity appears consensual; can involve force and/or enticement- based methods of compliance and is often accompanied by violence or threats of violence; can be perpetrated by individuals or groups, males or females, and young people or adults; and is typified by some form of power imbalance in favour of those perpetrating the exploitation. Whilst age may be the most obvious, this power imbalance can also be due to a range of other factors including gender, cognitive ability, physical strength, status, and access to economic or other resources.&#8221;</p>

Police forces and local authorities are each designated First Responders. The Home Office Guidance says, in relation to schools and other organisations, in the case of any child who they think may be at risk of "county lines exploitation", the designated safeguarding lead is to make a safeguarding referral to the responsible local authority. It is for the local authority's social services to consider, with safeguarding partner agencies, whether any further actions are necessary to protect the child. </p>

Where there are concerns, there should be an assessment to determine whether there are any causal factors such as undiagnosed learning difficulties, difficulties with communication, or mental health issues. If it is thought housing, family, or other domestic circumstances may be contributing to the presenting behaviour, a multi-agency agency approach, supported by the use of approaches such as the Early Help Assessment, may be appropriate.

On 19 August 2024 the local authority, as designated First Responder, made a referral to the NRM on the basis that the Claimant was a potential victim of CCE. On 30 August 2024, the NRM made a positive reasonable grounds decision on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that the Claimant was a victim of human trafficking. By this time he had also been arrested on 26 August 2024 at the Notting Hill Carnival for possession of a hunting-style knife in a public place. Fordham J held that these events subsequent to the GDP&#8217;s refusal of reconsideration on 24 June 2024 could not affect the outcome of the judicial review, and there has &#8211; correctly, as it seems to me &#8211; been no challenge to that decision in this court.

The next ground was that the GDP misapplied the legal test for a permanent exclusion in failing to engage with the requirement in a case of proposed permanent exclusion that to allow the pupil to remain in school would &#8220;seriously harm the education or welfare of the pupil or others such as staff or pupils in the school&#8221;.

For my part I would regard it as an extraordinary step for any court to say that the solution to the difficult problems raised by the Claimant&#8217;s behaviour should be resolved by an order informing the Principal and governors that unless they immediately readmitted him to the school they would be liable to be sent to prison. </p>

		    <intro>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The first step is a legal point about the relevance, to a PEX decision, of the Article 4 positive obligation. This was the essence of Ms Braganza KC's submissions. By virtue of s.6 of the HRA (read with ECHR Article 4), relevant UK public authorities owe a positive obligation to take appropriate measures within the scope of their powers to protect an identified individual in respect of whom they are aware, or ought to be aware, of circumstances giving rise to a credible suspicion of a real and immediate risk of having been, or being, trafficked or exploited: see <span style="font-style:italic">TDT</span> at &#167;&#167;14-18. This is an important protection duty. Where the circumstances are such as to trigger the protection duty, it could not be lawful for a designated First Responder to refuse to make a referral to the NRM: see <span style="font-style:italic">TDT</span> &#167;&#167;33-36. True it is that the Principal and the GDP are not designated First Responders. But they are relevant public authorities with a role to play. Where the Article 4 protective duty is triggered in relation to a pupil facing PEX, that does not necessarily mean that PEX is unlawful or unreasonable as a response. It is the state as a whole which has to protect. But a Principal, and a GDP, need to recognise the duty and consider it, especially because of the importance of school as a protective environment for a person vulnerable to modern slavery including CCE. That means [according to Ms Braganza] that the test for PEX must be interpreted and understood as if it said:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">I cannot accept these submissions. On this part of the case I agree with Mr Glenister. The Academy was alive to the issue of CCE and was right to have concerns. The IRP was satisfied that the Academy had taken CCE into consideration at the time of the Principal's decision and the GDP's original consideration. The Academy's CCE concern was flagged up to the police on the day of the PEX decision (18.1.24). But it was never suggested to &#8211; or even argued before &#8211; the GDP at Stage (2) or the IRP at Stage (3) or the GDP at Stage (4) that there was a positive Article 4 duty; still less such a duty owed by the Academy. The MASH referral (29.11.23: &#167;22 above) was about risk of harm, due to the Academy's concerns regarding the Claimant being brought by the police, his friendship group outside school, possible drug misuse and the Claimant's parents finding it very difficult to manage his behaviour at home. There were the drugs and the cash, and the Academy raised these promptly with the social worker (SW1) and the police. The Academy was not told &#8211; in the follow-up to the MASH referral &#8211; about the first A&amp;E visit. The Academy's staff identified the drugs and the cash to SW1 and to the police, and had discussed these. The police and the social worker were content that the cash be returned to the mother, because she had explained that she had given the cash to the Claimant. Pausing there, and bearing in mind what is said about probing, it is relevant to note that the mother has given fresh evidence in a witness statement to this Court &#8211; with a statement of truth &#8211; that the cash did come from her for the jacket. Putting that to one side, that is what she confirmed at the time. SW1 and the police were not concerned about that answer. There was the truancy episode, with other pupils. And there was the rooftop episode with others of similar age&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">If Ms Braganza KC's legal logic were correct, it would mean that the local authority and the police owed a protection duty, based on the circumstances known to them, to make an NRM referral which &#8211; given the applicable threshold &#8211; would have led to a reasonable grounds decision. Neither the local authority nor the police considered that a CCE positive obligation threshold had been crossed. Nor did they think it was crossed when the GDP was first dealing with the case; nor when the IDP was dealing with the case; and nor when it was back in front of the GDP. Neither the local authority nor the police told the Academy that the duty was triggered. There was the MASH referral; and there was the local authority Child in Need Plan. SW1 knew more about the Claimant's circumstances than did the Academy. The Academy was entitled to act with the other authorities and to share the information, especially given that the local authority and police are the designated First Responders. No NRM referral was made until 19.8.24, after the impugned decision and after the particular red flag related to the Doncaster arrest. To the police and local authority, that changed the picture and triggered action. Only by an impermissible exercise of hindsight &#8211; based on subsequent events &#8211; could it be concluded that an Article 4 positive protection duty arose at 18.1.24 or 24.6.24. There was, in my judgment, no Article 4 trigger requiring appropriate measures within the scope of public authority powers to protect the Claimant as a person in respect of whom the Academy "was aware, or ought to be aware" of circumstances giving rise to "a credible suspicion of a real and immediate risk of having been, or being, trafficked or exploited". Still less was it unreasonable for the Academy not to identify such circumstances. That means the claim on this ground cannot succeed whatever is the position in relation to steps 1 and 2. I did not need to take up the parties' offer of further written submissions on step 2. The Article 4 ground for judicial review therefore fails.&#8221;</p>

Excluding the child may well be harmful to his life chances and increase his vulnerability, which is why permanent exclusion should be a last resort; but allowing him to remain at or return to the school may create a serious risk to the welfare of other pupils and the staff.</p>

In the Court&#8217;s view, the duty to take operational measures under Article 4 of the Convention has two principal aims: to protect the victim of trafficking from further harm; and to facilitate his or her recovery. It is axiomatic that the prosecution of victims of trafficking would be injurious to their physical, psychological and social recovery and could potentially leave them vulnerable to being re-trafficked in future.&#8221;</p>

Nevertheless, it was submitted that the procedural and protective obligations required the Academy at a minimum to have regard, when considering PEX, to the role played by any CCE in the behaviour leading to the disciplinary proceedings and to any risk of further CCE which might result from PEX and its impact on the child. The Academy was obliged to conduct an inquiry sufficient to establish the effect of any CCE to which the child is victim and to assess any further CCE as a consequence of PEX, and whether PEX would have a disproportionate impact on the grounds of race. These obligations were not displaced by the fact that CCE was not expressly raised at the GDP or IRP hearings.</p>

The decision may be wrong, not because of some specific error of principle in that narrow sense, but because of an identifiable flaw in the judge's reasoning, such as a gap in logic, a lack of consistency, or a failure to take account of some material factor, which undermines the cogency of the conclusion. However, it is equally clear that, for the decision to be &#8220;wrong&#8221; under CPR r 52.11(3), it is not enough that the appellate court might have arrived at a different evaluation.

It does not carry out the balancing task afresh as though it were rehearing the case but must adopt a traditional function of review, asking whether the decision of the judge below was wrong &#8230;&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The vivid expression &#8230;.. that the first instance trial should be seen as the "main event" rather than a "try out on the road" has resonance even for a case which does not involve oral testimony. A first instance judgment provides a template on which criticisms are focused and the assessment of factual issues by an appellate court can be a very different exercise in the appeal setting than during the trial. Impressions formed by a judge approaching the matter for the first time may be more reliable than a concentration on the inevitable attack on the validity of conclusions that he or she has reached which is a feature of an appeal founded on a challenge to factual findings. The case for reticence on the part of the appellate court, while perhaps not as strong in a case where no oral evidence has been given, remains cogent&#8230;&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In response Ms Braganza relied on <span style="font-style:italic">Afriyie v Commissioner of Police for the City of London</span> [2024] EWCA Civ 1269. A police officer used a taser in circumstances where he honestly believed there was a need to use force. The trial judge held that the use of force was reasonable and proportionate. This court allowed the claimant&#8217;s appeal. William Davis LJ said at paragraph 40:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is not suggested by the Appellant that the court should substitute its view of what happened for that of the trial judge. Rather, the question is whether the conclusions she drew from the evidence were ones reasonably open to her. The court is concerned inter alia with the objective reasonableness or proportionality of PC Pringle&#8217;s actions. That is a matter of law: see <span style="font-style:italic">Dallison v Caffery </span>[1965] 1 QB 348 at 372A.&#8221;</p>

Baroness Carr LCJ said that &#8220;the use of a taser on the appellant, who at the time of discharge was standing still in a non-aggressive stance with his arms folded and talking to his friend was not objectively reasonable in the circumstances.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is now no dispute in this case that the trigger or threshold test for identifying a case of potential child criminal exploitation, derived from the decision of the Strasbourg court in <span style="font-style:italic">Rantsev v Cyprus and Russia </span>and applied by this court in the <span style="font-style:italic">TDT </span>case, is whether the state authorities are aware or ought to be aware of circumstances giving rise to a credible suspicion that the child concerned has been trafficked or exploited or that there is a real and immediate risk of his being trafficked. It is not sufficient to show, in the case of a school, a risk that permanent exclusion of a child will increase his vulnerability and the possibility that he might be drawn into further or more serious criminal activity.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fordham J examined the facts in detail and with great care. I have set out (at [31] above) his critical finding of fact that the Article 4 protective duty was not triggered in this case at the time of the decision under review. Even if the question for us were simply whether his finding was correct, I would hold that it was. But the matter is put beyond doubt by the observations of Lord Carnwath and Lord Kerr in the two Supreme Court cases cited above. It is not reasonably arguable that the finding of fact by Fordham J was &#8220;wrong&#8221;. Despite the elaborate arguments addressed to us, I would accordingly refuse permission to appeal on both Grounds 1 and 2.</p>

I would only add two comments. Firstly, I do not accept that, even if the credible suspicion threshold had been crossed, the school would have been automatically required to reinstate the Claimant. I do not, therefore, agree with the sentence  I have italicised from paragraph 61 of the judgment below, which in any event seems inconsistent with other observations of the judge.</p>
