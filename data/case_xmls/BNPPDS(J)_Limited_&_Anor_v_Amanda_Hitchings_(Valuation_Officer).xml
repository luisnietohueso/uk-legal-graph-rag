This question arises from a 2017 rating list decision of the Valuation Tribunal for England (&#8216;VTE&#8217;) in which it rejected the appellant&#8217;s case for a reduction of the entry to a nominal sum and dismissed their appeal.</p>

We have not seen a copy of the &#8216;challenge&#8217; form itself, but the supporting statement provided by the appellant&#8217;s agent, Altus Group, was submitted in evidence.   The grounds of the challenge were that, from 15th December 2022 the hereditament was undergoing a major programme of refurbishment which rendered it incapable of beneficial occupation as a matter of fact.  Reliance was placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Newbigin (VO) v Monk</span> [2017] 1 WLR 851 (&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Monk&#8217;</span>) and it was proposed that the Property should be valued at RV &#163;1 for the duration of the scheme and the resultant period of incapability.</p>

The Property was inspected on behalf of the VO by Mr Oliver Ridley MRICS on 26 April 2024.  He observed that McDonald&#8217;s had installed an &#8216;integral food preparation area&#8217; in the warehouse as well as meeting rooms and break out areas.  The manager of the kitchen informed him that McDonald&#8217;s had opened for business approximately a year earlier which suggests that they had completed their fitting out works at the end of April or the beginning of May 2023.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">We infer from the fact that McDonald&#8217;s lease began on the date of practical completion and only four or five weeks then elapsed until they opened the new kitchen for business, that McDonald&#8217;s must have agreed to take a lease of the Property well before the end of March 2023.  The use of the Property as a kitchen would, in planning terms, be &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">sui generis</span>&#8217; which would have required a change of use application to the planning authority.  McDonald&#8217;s would have needed time to plan the layout of the kitchen, book the contractors to do the work and source the materials and appliances to complete the scheme.   They may have needed Building Regulations approval.   The landlord would be unlikely to have removed the mezzanine floor unless they were sure it would not be required by an incoming tenant.  Otherwise, the opportunity to charge rent for it on a future letting might be passed up.  It is reasonable to conclude therefore that McDonald&#8217;s must have been secured as a tenant either before, or very soon after, the works undertaken by the landlord began and that the two schemes were undertaken one immediately after the other or with only a very short break between them.</p>

Case law directed that it should also be assumed that the landlord had first put the property into repair.  In applying that assumption, as Lord Hodge explained, at [17], &#8220;[c]ase law distinguished between a mere lack of repair, which did not affect rateable value because of the hypothetical landlord&#8217;s obligation to repair, and redevelopment works which made a building uninhabitable.&#8221; </p>

Before the 1988 Act the statutory hypothesis had been that the landlord was assumed to bear the cost of repairs under the notional tenancy of the hereditament. In a series of decisions of the Court of Appeal this had been held to require an assumption that defects which were present in reality would be put right at the notional landlord&#8217;s expense, and so would not reduce the rateable value of the subject. In <span style="font-style:italic">Benjamin</span> the Lands Tribunal held that, by placing responsibility for repairs under the hypothetical tenancy on the tenant, the new valuation hypothesis (as originally enacted), did not permit an assumption that the hereditament was in repair if, in reality, it was not. The promoter of the Bill which became the 1999 Act had explained to Parliament that the purpose of the change was to address this conclusion, and to reverse its effect so that an old principle governing rating valuation should merely be restated&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Monk</span>, at [21]).&#8221;</p>

The distinction is one of fact, which must be assessed objectively, taking account of the condition of the building and the works which are being undertaken to it.  Mr Donmall asserted that an end of tenancy refurbishment did not come close to justifying deletion because it did not involve reconstruction or redevelopment, which were the activities considered by Lord Hodge in <span style="font-style:italic">Monk</span>.   But redevelopment, in the sense that a surveyor might deploy the word, generally refers to the construction of new buildings after clearing a site of whatever occupied it before.  There is no doubt that such buildings would not be rateable until they were complete and capable of occupation (or deemed to be).  Similarly, reconstruction is not a word of precise meaning and might involve different degrees of rebuilding, repairing or restoring a building or property. Rather than debating semantics we consider it is necessary to focus on the known facts about the condition of the building.   </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">There is no real doubt that, having regard to the circumstances on the ground at the material day and the programme of works, the Property could not have been beneficially occupied as a warehouse.  Mr Donmall&#8217;s submissions recognised that beneficial occupation would have required at least the reinstallation of electrical fittings which had just been removed.  There is certainly evidence that, in some respects, the Property was in disrepair, with some damaged cladding panels and broken roof lights.  But the preparation of the internal parts of the building in readiness for McDonald&#8217;s phase of the works was not work of repair, it involved the removal of items which were not replaced and significant remodelling of the interior parts, akin to the works envisaged in <span style="font-style:italic">Monk</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Canary Wharf</span>.  Considered in the round, the facts show that the Property was not simply being subjected to a programme of end of tenancy repairs, it was being repurposed from a warehouse to a delivery kitchen.  This involved a material change of use in planning terms (and perhaps also a change in the mode or category of occupation for rating purposes, although we have insufficient evidence about the &#8216;dark kitchen&#8217; operation being conducted from the Property to form a view on that and we do not base our decision on it).  What is indisputable is that the substantial programme of works which had been embarked on was not simply remedying defects but would additionally include the provision of new services and a substantial reduction in the useable floor area.  In our judgment, although the landlord undertook the initial works to prepare the building for McDonald&#8217;s to fit out to their own specification, the object and timing of the two projects means that they should be viewed as a single scheme.  </p>

We do not see why a building which has never been in the list should be treated more favourably than one which has, when both are in substantially the same condition.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Determining whether a building is capable of beneficial occupation or not requires an exercise of judgment about the facts of each case.  Our conclusion that the assessment of the Property should be reduced to a nominal level (in the absence of a proposal to remove it altogether), is based on the facts of this case and neither establishes nor illustrates any new principle.   </p>

Since the works were completed in April 2023, the VO has the ability to make a list alteration on the 2023 rating list and there appears to be no need for us to use our powers under regulation 38(7) of the Valuation Tribunal for England (Council Tax and Rating Appeals) (Procedure) Regulations 2009.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify">Any party has a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal on any point of law arising from this decision.&#160; The right of appeal may be exercised only with permission. An application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal must be sent or delivered to the Tribunal so that it is received within 1 month after the date on which this decision is sent to the parties (unless an application for costs is made within 14 days of the decision being sent to the parties, in which case an application for permission to appeal must be made within 1 month of the date on which the Tribunal&#8217;s decision on costs is sent to the parties).&#160; An application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the Tribunal to which it relates, identify the alleged error or errors of law in the decision, and state the result the party making the application is seeking.&#160; If the Tribunal refuses permission to appeal a further application may then be made to the Court of Appeal for permission.</p>
