	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt">The appellant was employed by the first respondent and worked on a full-time basis as Branch Secretary of a recognised union. The second respondent, who was also an employee of the first respondent, had been a member of the union but had decided that he wanted to leave. During a discussion between the appellant and the second respondent about ongoing deduction of union subscriptions from his wages, the second respondent became angry and made a remark to the appellant which was capable of amounting to racist abuse. The tribunal found that the remark had been made, but concluded on the evidence that it had not been made &#8220;in the course of&#8221; the second respondent&#8217;s employment in terms of section 109(1) of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">Equality Act, 2010</span><span style="font-size:12pt">. It also found that, in terms of section 109(4), the first respondent had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the second respondent from making the remark or from doing anything of that description. </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt">The appellant submitted that the tribunal had erred in law (i) in its application of section 109(1) by focussing solely on what was said rather than looking at on the totality of the facts; and (ii) in its application of section 109(4) by failing to ask the second of the two questions referred to in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">Canniffe v.

The full hearing Orders required each respondent lodge and serve an Answer to the appeal within 28 days of 1 November 2023. The second respondent did not do so. By Order of the Registrar dated 1 August 2024, the second respondent was, therefore, debarred from taking any further part in this appeal. The first respondent has lodged an Answer and Grounds of Resistance to the appeal. </span></p>

In spite of having intimated this to the union, membership subscriptions were still being deducted from his wages by check-off.

He told the appellant that he wanted the subscriptions that had been deducted to be refunded. The appellant told him that he would not be reimbursed. The second respondent left the office but returned shortly afterwards to continue pressing the issue (ET &#167; 6 and 7). In the course of that second meeting, the second respondent became angry and repeatedly referred to the appellant as a &#8220;fucking muppet&#8221;.  As his frustration grew, he then referred to the appellant as a &#8220;fucking monkey&#8221; (ET &#167; 12-15). The potential significance of this, the tribunal noted, was that appellant is black and the second respondent is white.</span></p>

It took place during the second respondent&#8217;s working day, albeit during a break. It happened in an office that was situated a few hundred metres from the ward on which the second respondent mainly worked. It related to the deduction of subscriptions for union membership that entitled the second respondent to the support of a union recognised by the first respondent and in which the appellant had an important role.</span></p>

The tribunal noted that the second respondent did not have to be a union member to be employed by the first respondent. His membership was a matter of personal choice.

The tribunal finds that, applying the ordinary, everyday meaning of the term &#8220;during the course of employment&#8221;, the interaction between Mr Hammond and Mr Campbell did not occur during the course of the Mr Hammond&#8217;s employment by the Trust.&#8221;</p>

The weight it attributed to those factors was pre-eminently a matter for the tribunal as an industrial jury.
