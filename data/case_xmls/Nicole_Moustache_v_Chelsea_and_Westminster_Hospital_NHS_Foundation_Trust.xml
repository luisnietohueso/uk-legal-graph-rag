The Employment Tribunal (ET) addressed and decided those issues. It dismissed all the listed claims.  The Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) held that the ET should have identified and determined a further claim which was not on the agreed list. The employer now appeals.</p>

In the light of those conclusions, and for the further reasons given below, I have concluded that the appeal should be allowed. In summary, the agreed list of issues included all the claims that, on an objective analysis, the employee had put forward in her statements of case. The ET was entitled to proceed on the basis that there was no other claim for it to consider. There was nothing in the employee&#8217;s statements of case nor was there any other circumstance that placed it under a duty to do otherwise. There was therefore no breach of duty. The EAT&#8217;s decision should be set aside and the ET&#8217;s final order should be reinstated. </p>

From 2001 to 2019 she worked for the appellant employer, an NHS Foundation Trust. Initially, she was a senior administrator. Following hip replacement operations in 2012 and 2015 she suffered from a physical disability within the meaning of section 6 of the Equality Act 2010. There were consequent changes to her job functions. In 2017, the employee lodged grievances about the way she had been treated by her line manager. At a facilitation meeting in August 2017 the grievances were resolved on the basis that certain specified actions would be taken. </p>

In May 2018 she began a period of absence from work which was to continue until her dismissal some 13 months later. On 31 July 2018 the employer decided not to uphold the 2018 grievances.  On 6 November 2018 the employee&#8217;s appeal against that decision was rejected. On 10 December 2018, she filed an ET1 claim form with the ET (the First Claim).</p>

OH reported that the employee might be fit to return to work with some support but that she had decided that she would not return whatever adjustments were put in place. Absence review meetings with the employee followed on 1 March and 31 May 2019.  On 13 June 2019, the employer dismissed her on grounds of capability. On 16 June 2019 the employee stated to the employer by email that she would not be appealing the decision to dismiss her. On 1 September 2019 the employee filed a further ET1 claim form (the Second Claim).</p>

Section 8.1 asks the claimant to &#8220;please indicate the type of claim you are making by ticking one or more of the boxes below&#8221;. Section 8.2 asks the claimant to &#8220;please set out the background and details of your claim in the space below&#8221;. This is a free-text box. Section 9 of the form asks &#8220;What do you want if your claim is successful?&#8221;.  Section 9.1 is a tick-box section which asks the claimant to &#8220;say what you want if your claim is successful&#8221;. Four options are offered. The first two involve getting  a job (&#8220;your old job back &#8230; (reinstatement)&#8221; or &#8220;another job with the same employer or associated employer &#8230;(re-engagement)&#8221;) and compensation. The third is &#8220;compensation only&#8221; and the fourth is &#8220;if claiming discrimination, a recommendation&#8221;. Section 9.2 is a free text box which asks a claimant who is claiming financial compensation to give details.</p>

She also ticked the box to state &#8220;I am making another type of claim which the Employment Tribunal can deal with&#8221;, identifying &#8220;bullying, harassment and victimization&#8221;. In section 8.2 the employee gave a narrative of events between June 2017 and 12 October 2018 which focused on her grievances and the way they were dealt with by the employer. She mentioned a panic attack and being signed off sick with work-related stress for 2 weeks in 2017. But it was not clear on what grounds she was claiming discrimination nor what disability she was alleging. In section 9 of the form the employee, still in the respondent&#8217;s employment at the time, ticked the boxes to claim compensation only and a recommendation.</p>

It sought Further and Better Particulars (FBPs) of the allegations of discrimination. One of the questions was what &#8220;physical and/or mental conditions&#8221; were relied on as a disability within the meaning of section 6 of the Equality Act 2010 (EqA). FBPs were ordered and provided by the employee. These stated that she &#8220;had a second hip replacement in March 2015 and I had difficulty walking unaided. I often had to use a stick. The [employer] was aware of my disability. I believe I am disabled in terms of the [EqA]&#8221;. She went on to detail ways in which this physical disability had affected her work and, on her account, led to adverse treatment by the employer.</p>

On 6 June 2019 the employer&#8217;s solicitors sent the employee a draft list of issues and asked her to confirm various matters &#8220;in order for the [employer] and Tribunal to understand the nature of your claims&#8221;. On 13 June 2019 the employee asked for more time as she was &#8220;still awaiting some professional advice on the Draft List of Issues&#8221;. At the case management hearing the EJ directed the employer to &#8220;update the draft list of issues&#8221; and to send a copy to the employee. That was done on 24 June 2019. The draft identified the issue as to the employee&#8217;s &#8220;disability status&#8221; in these terms: &#8220;was [the employee] a disabled person within the meaning of section 6 [EqA] by reason of a mobility issue?&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In section 8.1 of her ET1 in the Second Claim, filed on 1 September 2019, the employee ticked the box to record that she was making a claim for being &#8220;unfairly dismissed (including constructive dismissal)&#8221;. She did not tick any of the boxes to make a discrimination claim nor any other box in that section. In section 8.2 she recorded her dismissal and stated, &#8220;I believe I was unfairly dismissed from my employment due to having been on long term sickness since May 2018.&#8221; The narrative that followed stated that the employee had been dismissed when &#8220;still signed off sick with work related stress&#8221;. It went on to state that her employment had been terminated &#8220;on the grounds of capability due to ill health&#8221;. She did not believe this was a &#8220;satisfactory reason in this case&#8221;. She said &#8220;I would have been capable of doing my job&#8221; but had repeatedly been told that if she returned to work she &#8220;would be placed under the management of the same line manager&#8221; against whom she had filed grievances. She was suffering with worsened anxiety at the thought of doing this. Section 8.2 concluded by bringing to the ET&#8217;s attention the employee&#8217;s &#8220;ongoing Age and Disability Discrimination Case against the same employer&#8221; under a different reference number.</p>

This was a version of the document dated 24 June 2019 which had been amended (in track changes) to reflect subsequent developments. The final draft recorded the employer&#8217;s admission that the employee had the disability alleged in the First Claim and included &#8220;the legal questions for the Tribunal to determine in the unfair dismissal claim&#8221;. These were the three issues that had been raised by the employer.  On 1 October 2020 the employee replied by email &#8220;to confirm that I accept the final list of issues which you have updated&#8221;. The solicitors sent the list to the ET the following day.</p>

The hearing was remote due to the Covid pandemic. The employee represented herself with help from her daughter. The employer was represented by a solicitor.  At the start of the hearing there was some discussion about the List of Issues. The bundle contained a copy of the original version from June 2019. The EJ referred to that list and asked the parties whether anything had changed. The employer&#8217;s advocate told the Tribunal about the agreed updated and revised List of Issues and provided copies. The hearing was then suspended for the panel members to read the papers before hearing the employee&#8217;s evidence. The ET heard three days of evidence and argument, took one day for deliberation, and reserved its decision.</p>

The decision was that &#8220;all claims fail and are dismissed&#8221;. The accompanying Reasons began by identifying the complaints advanced in the two claim forms as &#8220;disability discrimination, age discrimination and unfair dismissal&#8221;. Paragraph [3] identified the issues to be determined as those &#8220;contained in an updated List of Issues document&#8221; and stated that they were &#8220;referred to more specifically in our conclusions&#8221;. Paragraphs [4] to [13] of the Reasons set out the law and the burden of proof. Paragraphs [14] to [53] set out the ET&#8217;s findings of fact. Paragraph [54] referred to the parties&#8217; closing submissions. The final section of the Reasons was headed &#8220;Conclusions&#8221;.  Paragraph [55] stated that the ET had &#8220;reached the following conclusions on the agreed issues&#8221;. These were, in summary, that the disability discrimination claims failed because five of them were out of time and none of them were made out on the evidence; and the unfair dismissal claim failed because the employer acted reasonably in dismissing the employee.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Addressing the claim for unfair dismissal the ET found that the employer had consulted the employee. At four absence review meetings it had enquired as to the reasons for her continued absence and sought her views on the likelihood of return and any reasonable adjustments which might exist. She had indicated that she was unfit to resume work in any capacity and that this would not be altered by any adjustments the employer could make. By referring the employee to OH the employer had taken appropriate steps to establish the medical position. It had asked appropriate and relevant questions as to whether the point of dismissal had been reached. By the date of the final review meeting the employee had been absent for 13 months with no foreseeable return date. The need to cover her work in her absence had caused pressure on the running of the service and an additional cost burden. In the light of all these findings the dismissal was in all the circumstances fair. </p>

It was submitted that the ET could not be criticised in the present case as the employee had agreed the list of issues without having set out any claim of disability discrimination arising out of dismissal and had only sought to widen her claim later. It was further submitted that if the point had been raised at the final hearing it would not have been appropriate to allow an amendment.</p>

The judge referred to passages in section 8.2 of the ET1 form and went on: &#8220;I also consider that this issue of discrimination became increasingly obvious in the Claimant&#8217;s witness statement (dated July 2020) in which she stated that the deterioration in her mental health amounted to a disability.&#8221; She continued, &#8220;Those details should, in my judgment, have given the Tribunal and Respondent, an obvious indication that the dismissal concerned an asserted disability and so may have been discriminatory.&#8221;</p>

The claim, as set out in the ET1, is not something just to set the ball rolling, as an initial document necessary to comply with time limits but which is otherwise free to be augmented by whatever the parties choose to add or subtract merely on their say so. Instead, it serves not only a useful but a necessary function. It sets out the essential case. It is that to which a respondent is required to respond. A respondent is not required to answer a witness statement, nor a document, but the claims made - meaning, under the [ET Rules], the claim as set out in the ET1.</p>

This is the core function of the tribunal. That does not mean that the ET has to resolve every issue that is raised in a case.  Sometimes a party will not press all the claims that have been pleaded; the ET is not obliged to address those which are raised but later abandoned: see <span style="font-style:italic">Mensah v East Hertfordshire NHS Trust </span>[1998] IRLR 531. And the ET needs only decide enough to reach a conclusion on the claims that have been pressed.

It may consider it appropriate to explore the scope of a party&#8217;s case by way of clarification. That may, in particular, be considered appropriate in the case of an unrepresented party.  Whether to do so is however a matter of judgment and discretion which will rarely qualify as an error of law such that the EAT can interfere. The ET has no general duty to take pro-active steps to prompt some expansion or modification of the case advanced by a party where that might be to their advantage.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The following analysis seems to me correct in principle and consistent with the case law. The starting point is to consider what claims emerge from an objective analysis of the statements of case. A failure by the tribunal to identify and address those claims is liable to amount to a breach of its core duty and hence an error of law. A failure to identify and determine a claim that does not emerge from such an analysis can amount to an error of law but only in rare or exceptional circumstances of the kind outlined in <span style="font-style:italic">Drysdale</span>.   It is in this overall context that the role of an agreed list of issues falls for consideration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A list of issues is not a pleading but a case management tool. The main purpose of such a document is to summarise the existing pleadings not to amend them. On the other hand, as <span style="font-style:italic">Mensah </span>shows, a party may conduct itself in such a way as to lose the right to have the ET decide a pleaded issue, thereby reducing the scope of the tribunal&#8217;s corresponding duty. An agreed list of issues is one way in which that could in principle be done. Such a list is, after all, an express agreement that the tribunal should conduct the proceedings in a particular way, and an invitation to the tribunal to do so.  A tribunal will usually be entitled to confine its attention to the issues on the list. By way of exception, however, it may be necessary in the interests of justice to depart from even an agreed list. There are at least two distinct categories of situation in which that may be so. The first is where a pleaded claim has been omitted from the list in circumstances that do not amount to abandonment of the claim. The second is where the claim has not been pleaded but the fundamental duty of fairness makes it necessary (that is to say, essential) that it should be raised and considered. </p>

At [63] HHJ Auerbach identified as his starting point the question of &#8220;whether the claim form, read or not with other relevant documents, should have been treated as advancing a claim of constructive dismissal pursuant to section 39 EqA.&#8221;  He found that although such a claim was not expressly identified it was &#8220;plainly being asserted&#8221; and &#8220;shouted out&#8221; from the particulars of claim which &#8220;should have been treated as including&#8221; such a claim.  In my view the ratio decidendi of the case is that on an objective reading of the statements of case in their proper context the employee was claiming that her constructive dismissal flowed from acts of discrimination. The judge did say, further and alternatively, that the issue &#8220;should at least have been raised and clarified by the tribunal at the initial case management hearing&#8221;.  In reaching that conclusion the judge referred to <span style="font-style:italic">Drysdale</span> and made clear that he regarded his conclusions as consistent with the principles there identified. I therefore read this alternative ground of decision as a finding that if (contrary to the judge&#8217;s primary conclusion) the discrimination claim was not clearly pleaded then, on the facts of the case, the claim was so obvious that it was perverse of the tribunal not to identify it.</p>

As for the agreed list of issues Bean LJ, having considered Rule 29 of the ET Rules, <span style="font-style:italic">Mensah, Muskett, Parekh, McLeary </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Scicluna</span>, held (at [38], [43]-[47]) that an ET should consider at the substantive hearing whether any list of issues previously drawn up &#8220;properly reflects the significant issues in dispute&#8221;; if it is clear that it does not or that it may not do so the tribunal should consider whether an amendment to the list of issues is &#8220;necessary in the interests of justice&#8221; within the meaning of Rule 29; that will depend on a number of factors, including the stage at which the issue arises, whether the list was agreed between legal representatives, and whether an amendment would delay or disrupt the hearing; on the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">Mervyn</span> it was necessary in the interests of justice for the list to be amended so that the tribunal could consider constructive unfair dismissal.

It included a concession that the employee had &#8220;failed to articulate that the dismissal itself was the product of discrimination&#8221;. The submission was that this was &#8220;a mistake made by a litigant in person&#8221; and the ET should have clarified the position.  The EAT&#8217;s judgment was on similar lines. The judge did not say that the ET1 was a sufficient pleading of the case. She said that it contained features that gave an &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">indication</span>&#8221; that the dismissal &#8220;concerned an asserted disability&#8221; and so &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">may</span> have been discriminatory&#8221; (the emphasis is mine).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This was a claim by an articulate professional woman who had recently demonstrated an understanding of the concepts of discrimination and disability. She had deployed both in her First Claim. She had shown an ability to use form ET1 in an appropriate way to express her intention to advance a claim for disability discrimination. At the time she did that she was, on her own account, suffering from stress and anxiety. In the months immediately preceding her second ET1 the precise nature of the disability relied on in the First Claim had been under active discussion. In that process she had not intimated that she was suffering from any mental health disability. If, at the time she completed the second ET1, she had considered her mental state to be a disability and her dismissal to be a further act of disability discrimination by her employer it would have been the simplest matter to tick the same boxes for a second time.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not accept, either, that the ET1 in the Second Claim &#8220;clearly asserted&#8221; all the essential elements of a disability discrimination claim. The ingredients of disability discrimination are identified in section 15(1) of the EqA. A claimant has to prove three things: that she is a &#8220;disabled person&#8221;, that she has been treated unfavourably by the respondent, and that this is &#8220;because of something arising in consequence of [her] disability&#8221;.  If those things are established the claim will succeed unless the respondent can show &#8220;that the treatment is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim&#8221;. Section 6(2) of the EqA tells us that a reference to &#8220;a disabled person&#8221; is a reference to &#8220;a person who has a disability&#8221;. Section 6(1) provides that &#8220;A person (P) has a disability if (a) P has a physical or mental impairment, and (b) the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on P&#8217;s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities&#8221;. Schedule 1 Part 1 contains provision as to the determination of disability. Paragraph 2 tells us among other things that &#8220;the effect of an impairment is long-term if (among other things) (a) it has lasted for at least 12 months&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The short answer to Ms Monaghan&#8217;s argument is that the concession made in the EAT was rightly made. Although the ET1 referred to the employee being signed off sick from work &#8220;due to anxiety stress and panic attacks due to my work situation&#8221; it did not clearly assert that this was the reason for her dismissal or even a reason. I would go further. I do not consider that the ET1 &#8220;shouted out&#8221; or made any clear assertion to the effect that the employee&#8217;s mental state amounted to a disability. She conspicuously did not use the words &#8220;disabled&#8221; or &#8220;disability&#8221;, other than to describe the allegations made in the First Claim. On the face of it she was presenting these as two related but different kinds of claim. Nor did the employee assert that the matters that led to her being signed off work impaired her ability to carry out &#8220;normal day to day activities&#8221;. The nub of the case she presented in the ET1 was that it was unfair to dismiss her for incapacity because she <span style="font-style:italic">was</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">capable</span> of doing her job; the only impediment to her doing so was the employer&#8217;s insistence that she would have to work with the line manager to whose behaviour she had objected.

Put another way, the only remaining question was whether the ET&#8217;s conclusion that the issues for determination were those identified in the agreed list of issues and no others was a perverse conclusion which no reasonable tribunal could have reached.</p>

She held that &#8220;it was or should have been clear to the Tribunal and the Respondent&#8221; that there were indications of a possible claim for disability discrimination in the ET1 in the Second Claim, the employee&#8217;s witness statement and her closing submissions; that it may have been the responsibility of the employer and in any event it was the ET&#8217;s obligation to discern those indications and to act on them by engaging in a process of clarification; and that such a process would inevitably have led to a discretionary or evaluative conclusion that it was necessary in the interests of justice to add such a claim by amendment to the list issues.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Monaghan has not sought to uphold this way of dealing with the matter, which seems to me to be flawed in several ways.  First, and perhaps least important, the language is distinctly unfortunate. To say that &#8220;it was &#8230; clear&#8221; to the tribunal and respondent that there were indications of such an additional claim appears to imply a finding of actual knowledge. I do not think that is what the judge meant. There was no evidence to this effect. On the contrary, it seems plain to me that the respondent and the tribunal acted in good faith. Secondly, I do not accept that the possibility of a claim for discriminatory dismissal &#8220;should have been clear&#8221;.  I have largely dealt with this already, but I would add that Ms Monaghan&#8217;s attempt to tease out the ingredients of such a claim from the language of the ET1 illustrated just how much legal and interpretative creativity that exercise requires.  Thirdly, it follows from the authorities that it will usually be wrong to try to define or interpret the issues by reference to documents that are not statements of case. Fourthly, I do not consider that either the employee&#8217;s witness statement or her closing argument in the ET provided any real support for an inference that she was seeking to advance a claim that her dismissal was an act of disability discrimination. Rather the contrary. The final submission did not assert that the dismissal was because of the disability but complained instead that the employer &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">did not take into consideration</span> the extent of my mental health disability.&#8221; (I do not think this deficiency is or can be made good by the post-judgment evidence submitted to the EAT, and note that the EAT did not rely on that evidence.)  In reality, the ET could only have elicited a disability discrimination claim by entering the adversarial arena, adopting an inquisitorial approach, and prompting an application to amend the claim. So far from being under a duty to do this the ET&#8217;s duty of impartiality obliged it not to embark on any such process. The test the judge applied was fundamentally mistaken in law.  It was a further legal error to treat the employee&#8217;s agreement to the list of issues as a factor of no weight or at best neutral.</p>

Strictly, therefore, the issue does not arise. However, I should make clear that I consider the ET&#8217;s conduct was not arguably perverse but clearly legitimate.  Besides the points already made about what was or was not evident from the claim form I would add the following.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The employee was a litigant in person but she was a senior administrator. She was not just literate but manifestly skilled and experienced in the use of words. She had some experience of litigation in the ET, and she had received legal advice in that context, even if she did not have it at the time she agreed the final list of issues. Her agreement to that list was given expressly, in writing, and unequivocally. There was no reason to doubt that this was a free and informed decision. There was nothing in the circumstances that suggested any element of oppression or unfairness on the part of the employer&#8217;s solicitors. There was no evidence nor any suggestion that they had used the list of issues to gain &#8220;advantage&#8221;, to use the judge&#8217;s word. The ET behaved fairly. It took steps at the outset of the hearing to check what the issues were. They were identified by reference to the agreed list, without demur from the employee. The hearing proceeded over several days thereafter on that basis. The employee did not suggest that the agreed list was incomplete at any time until after the ET&#8217;s decision. The hearing was remote but, with respect to the judge&#8217;s general observations about that matter, there is no evidence that this employee was thereby disadvantaged. </p>

On the judge&#8217;s own analysis this would have been a new and unpleaded claim. The ET would first have had to ascertain whether the employee wished to pursue it. If so, the new claim would have required formulation. A decision would then have been required on whether to allow it to be added by amendment. As part of that process it would have been necessary to consider matters such as the lateness of any amendment (including whether the claim was out of time); the degree to which the new claim would materially benefit the claimant; whether, as seems very likely, such an amendment would require an adjournment to allow the parties to prepare further evidence and submissions; and whether any resulting prejudice to the employer could be compensated. It is not obvious to me that the outcome would have been the grant of permission to amend. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">In the light of the ET&#8217;s ultimate findings of fact a claim for disability discrimination by dismissal might have been hard to sustain. Of course, the question of whether a dismissal amounts to disability discrimination contrary to s 15 EqA is analytically distinct from the question of whether it is fair. Before the EAT the employer conceded that for this reason the case should be remitted if the appeal was successful. Even so, the difficulties the employee would have faced are clear from a few illustrative points. The ET found that (1) the allegedly problematic line manager, EC, was absent on maternity leave from June 2018 to May 2019; (2) the employee &#8220;never at any point raised EC&#8217;s continued line management as a barrier to her return&#8221;; (3) in February 2019 the employee told OH that she would not return to work irrespective of whatever adjustments were put in place; and (4) in March 2019 the employee told her temporary line manager that there was nothing she could do to support the employee&#8217;s return to work.</p>
