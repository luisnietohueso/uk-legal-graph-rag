	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in">12 .In Miss Jeannette Wade&#8217;s most recent statement dated 27 March 2025, she explained that her experience of living in her flat has been a terrible time for her due to the noise nuisance that has been caused by the Defendant.  It has led to her having to move out of the property.  She did so in February of 2025. She has also been on medication for sleeping pills and anxiety.  Mentally, she says that she could not stand it anymore.  There is medical evidence in the bundle at 375 of a visit to the GP that she made which supports the impact that the noise nuisance was having on her well being.</p>

Notwithstanding, that particular caution due to the risk of exaggeration,  it is clear from the evidence taken as a whole that Miss Wade has been seriously impacted both mentally and physically with regards to the noise nuisance that she has suffered.</p>

Dr Morton made a  diagnosis  that the Defendant suffers from PTSD, anxiety, and mild features of obsessive compulsive disorder.

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">It is clear from Dr Morton&#8217;s report that the real issue with regards to the defendant that needs to be addressed with some urgency is her alcohol dependency.  It is right to say that in the past that the defendant has a history of multiple drug dependencies which she has managed to get herself out of, but at the time of his assessment Dr Morton was of the view that the defendant&#8217;s alcohol dependency was the significant factor with regards to her behaviours.</p>

	  <num>16.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">Standing back from this, one of the observations I would have with regards to this is that the alcohol usage of the Defendant may have led to situations where Miss Staples was unaware perhaps of the impact that her behaviours might have had upon others and that at times she may not have even remembered what she was doing due to the amount of alcohol she was drinking. Notwithstanding the antipathy that the Defendant feels towards Miss Jeannette Wade - I do not find that the noise nuisance was a deliberate targeting of Ms Wade by the Defendant. I find that this was more a situation of just a complete lack of awareness of the Defendant&#8217;s own behaviours  due to her alcohol dependency. This has also led to the Defendant wrongly blaming Ms Wade  for making complaints rather than accepting she is at fault. I am afraid that even at today&#8217;s hearing I observed in the Defendant that there is an element still of non-acceptance by her of the impact of her behaviours has had on Ms Wade and her neighbours.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">Mr Sanghera, on behalf of the Claimant, indicated that he believed that this was a category 2, possibly moving into a category 1 case, due to the level of harm that has been caused to Miss Wade.   Miss Elford, on behalf of the Defendant. says this is a category 3 case  as she suggested that the breaches have caused &#8220;little or no harm&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">When one looks at the evidence that has been provided by Miss Jeannette Wade, I do not think that category 3 is the appropriate category.  Ms Wade has suffered considerably over a couple of years from the noise disturbance that has been caused by the Defendant and this continued despite the Injunction Order being made.  It has led her to seek medical treatment and ultimately did lead her to making a decision to move from her secure housing association accommodation to  private rented sector accommodation.   Ms Wade by moving  has given up more secure accommodation and is having to pay increased rent. As a result, I  agree with Mr Sanghera in respect of this that this is a category 2 case but very much on the borderline going into category 1 due to the impact upon both Ms Wade&#8217;s mental and physical health.</p>

The CJC&#8217;s proposed scheme is a <marker name="tab"/>valuable tool for Judges to use, always bearing in mind that sentencing is highly fact <marker name="tab"/>sensitive, and the facts will vary widely.  It also bears emphasis that the proposed <marker name="tab"/>scheme does not have the authority of guidelines produced by a statutory body like the <marker name="tab"/>Sentencing Council.</p>

We have already had an adjournment in respect of this.  In my view, in terms of this particular breach, it is so serious that a custodial sentence is justified.  I consider that the appropriate length of sentence after considering all of the circumstances after taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors is 3 months imprisonment. </p>
