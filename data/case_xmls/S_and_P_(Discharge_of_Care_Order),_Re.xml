	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in">This judgment is not about Oscar Wilde or his works but about an application to discharge a care order.  However just before the final hearing of that application a decision was taken by the Legal Aid Agency to withdraw public funding from the applicant, a decision which, in my judgement, created such difficulties for her as to amount to a real injustice.  Oscar Wilde was no stranger to injustice and the above quotation seemed to me to neatly encapsulate the problem when funding decisions focus upon the price of representation as measured by the likelihood of success rather than the more intangible but significantly more important value of representation as a means to ensuring a just process irrespective of outcome.</p>

I will refer to the mother as &#8216;the mother&#8217; throughout this judgment but the children will be known as Susan and Peter, which are not their real names, but are correctly gendered.  Susan is a teenager whereas as Peter is still of primary school age.  When I spoke with Susan during the course of the final hearing I told her that for reasons which I will deal with below I wanted to publish the judgment but that if I did I would protect her family&#8217;s privacy so neither she nor anyone else reading it would recognise the family from the information included here. Susan had no issue with publication on that basis.  I made the same offer to the mother, who also agreed.  I have not spoken with Peter as it would be inappropriate to do so by reason of his age as well as his particular circumstances but he is represented through a very experienced Guardian and no dissent has been raised from that quarter either.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in">Whereas the father had been shown to be a large part of the problem for his family he very quickly demonstrated by his actions that he had no wish to be any part of the solution and disengaged from the proceedings to the extent that he would not even be honest about which country he was in during some of the hearings.  By the time of the final hearing his only relevance was as to the risk of a return and the threat which that would represent to the mother&#8217;s physical safety and the children&#8217;s emotional destabilisation.  In the event in the years which followed those proceedings he has not featured in the life of this family and the mother, to her credit, has divorced him and given no intimation of seeking his return to that relationship.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in">The absence of the father did not resolve all problems within the family because what was equally clear was that the mother, despite her willingness to work with the Local Authority, was hampered in two significant respects.  Firstly, the family are all nationals of another country and despite having resided in this one for nearly a decade the mother has never achieved any command of English.  Following the conclusion of the original proceedings the mother enrolled on a course to learn English but she disengaged and continues to be monolingual with the result that the court proceedings and all the work undertaken by social work professionals relating to these proceedings have had to be undertaken through an interpreter.</p>

	  <num style="text-indent:-0.25in">7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in">The lack of ability to absorb a new language was not a demonstration of any unwillingness on the mother&#8217;s part but rather a direct consequence of her second significant difficulty, her limited intellectual ability.  In her own childhood the mother had been brought up in the care of her grandparents whilst her own mother worked abroad.  According to the mother her formal education ended when she approximately 10 years old as she was withdrawn from school to care for her grandmother.  Whether by reason of how she was cared for, the environment in which she lived, the cultural norms in play in her country at that time or any inherent intellectual difficulties, the mother appears to have had very limited access to education as a child with the consequence that not only is she unable to read in any language but her abilities to understand, to conceptualise, to retain information, to assess, evaluate and project onto emerging scenarios are all limited.  During the first proceedings there was an assumption that any disconnect between what the mother was being told and what she understood were the result of either or both of not speaking England and having been in a long term abusive relationship in which she had been subjected to coercive and controlling behaviour from which she was only just beginning to emerge. The mother, initially at least, demonstrated sufficient progress to quell concerns over any lack of capacity as being a long term obstacle to meeting the children&#8217;s needs.  It was on that basis that it was assumed that engagement with support services would improve, that progress in caring for the children would be made and that the long term future for the family would be one of good enough parenting.</p>

	  <num style="text-indent:-0.25in">8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in">That was an important assumption because it was clear at that time that the children&#8217;s care had not been good enough and that even without the recurring exposure to the abuse meted out to the mother by the father there were concerns about the development of the children and whether that their welfare needs were being properly met.</p>

	  <num style="text-indent:-0.25in">9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in">Susan at the time was regarded as being a young carer because too many responsibilities were falling onto her shoulders because of her mother&#8217;s inability to engage properly not only with all of the organisations with which the family connected (e.g. school, nursery, the NHS and the social services) but also in terms of managing aspects of daily life which required the reading of instructions and the following of specific steps in any process.  The child was also having to take responsibility for digital tasks such as banking, emails and internet shopping.  It was a heavy burden upon a pre-teen child and in her Final Analysis in those proceedings the Guardian described Susan as presenting &#8216;as a child who was sad and guarded about her home life.&#8217;  In addition, and possibly because of her father, Susan was exhibiting challenging behaviour within the home, in the form of aggressive and abusive behaviour towards the mother. The mother&#8217;s limited intellectual functioning together with her growing reliance upon her daughter was creating an absence of boundaries for the child as she began to run rings around the mother.  The combination of needing the child to access digital services with the child&#8217;s discovery of social media lead to predictable results in the form of Susan accessing online dating sites and exchanging information and more with unidentified males.  The road to being beyond parental control lay ahead.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in">Peter was very much younger but showing early signs of developmental delay.  However enabling a child to catch up on their peers requires not just informed and constructive engagement with the child but also with those agencies responsible for monitoring child development. This mother was hampered on all fronts.  In addition, the mother&#8217;s inability to understand information and her lowered capacity for risk evaluation meant that there were safety concerns for Peter.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in">In contrast to the uncertainty over the mother&#8217;s capacity to develop her caring skills there was no doubt about the love which the mother and the children shared, it shone clearly for all to see.  The desire to remain together allied to the mother&#8217;s commitment to her children as well as the initial improvements in the emotional welfare of the children which followed reunification after an initial period of separation when the whereabouts of the father were unknown gave credence to the potential benefits to the children of living under parental care. In fact such was the apparent progress the mother appeared to be making that by the time of the final hearing in those proceedings the Local Authority was inviting the court to make a Supervision Order.  It was the Guardian who sought that a care order was in fact the necessary response to the developing situation, a recommendation formed in part in the knowledge that the Local Authority&#8217;s final view was formulated further up the chain of command than those on the ground who had favoured the longer term order.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in">I have the benefit of the Guardian&#8217;s Final Analysis as I write this judgment and it was clearly set out therein that the time-limited nature of the involvement offered by a supervision order was considered to be insufficient and the lack of parental responsibility likely to be a problem if implementation plans were not effective because they needed to be channelled through the mother.  The passage of time has proved this to have been an astute judgment by the Guardian.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in">In addition to those familiar problems new ones began to appear.  The relationship between mother and daughter started to deteriorate when Susan informed social workers that her mother was sending large sums of money via the internet to a man in Syria which, to Susan at least, appeared to be an obvious scam.  Whether this episode inspired Susan or it was simply a natural follow-on from her unwillingness to be boundaried by her mother she thereafter proved herself adept at using multiple mobile phones with her mother&#8217;s credit card to make purchases over the internet.  Susan&#8217;s mobile phone misuse was not restricted to financial activity but strayed far into the territory of social media, of inappropriate messaging sites, of sending inappropriate self-portraits to males and of videoing fights, of drug use and even of self-harm.  The contents of one of the several mobile phones which Susan was using demonstrated the scope if not the quantity of her inappropriate and wholly unregulated behaviour. This virtual record of her behaviour was matched by Susan&#8217;s increasing insularity from and insolence to her mother.</p>

The extent of Peter&#8217;s developmental delay was becoming clear and he required frequent and extended stimulation on a one to one basis.  In contrast to what he needed Peter appeared to be spending extended periods of time in an adapted high chair in which he could be secured.  There was a growing list of missed medical appointments and a failure to engage with services which involved sporadic as opposed to periodic appointments.  Information sent out by letter presented significant difficulties for the mother as it required Susan to read, understand and translate but the mother to then act upon.</p>

By the beginning of 2024 the FSW was visiting most days and for long periods, measured in hours, on each visit.  Despite this matters had deteriorated with Susan such that a safety plan had been devised in an attempt to rein in her activities outside the house and when in the house but on her mobile phones but this was not being enforced by the mother. As a result a further parenting assessment was set in motion to identify exactly what progress had been made and where the deficiencies in the mother&#8217;s caring abilities still lay.</p>

It was not a classic deliberate drugs overdose but rather a response to toothache (possibly caused by an infrequency of dental visits and a long term lack of supervision about basic personal care) which was ill-informed and exaggerated because it was based upon what her friends had told her about safe dosages.  Susan relied her friends because having told her mother she received the response that it was nothing.  As a consequence of relying upon misinformation Susan took 16 tablets in the space of 6 hours.  When the FSW arrived on the Tuesday Susan had been vomiting and was feeling unwell.  The FSW tried to explain to Susan how dangerous this intake of medication was only for the mother to tell Susan that the proper intake was 8 tablets in that period.  The mother was advised either to make a GP appointment or to take Susan to the Walk-In Centre.  Neither was done but a dental appointment was made for the Wednesday, by the FSW.  The social worker then asked the mother to make a GP appointment to ensure that there were no problems stemming from the amount of medication Susan had taken but the mother could not because she had no credit on her phone and although she went to the local shop to top up her credit she was unable to do so because she could not read the instructions on her receipt and the FSW needed to do this for her.  Once the credit was finally secured the mother rang the GP Surgery but could not follow the instructions about the options she was being given and the correctly numbered button to press, was unable to confirm which borough the family lived in and finally when finally connected to a GP  informed them Susan had taken only 6 paracetamol rather than 16 and was, in any event, unable to give the correct date of birth for her daughter.  </p>

Once there the situation then worsened once it became clear in the company of a social worker that Susan had accessed information via a mobile phone which, in accordance with the safety plan then in place, she was not supposed to have.  Susan herself told the social worker that she did have a mobile phone, that the mother had given it to her and that she was not prepared to give it to the social worker.  The mother arrived at the hospital for a meeting with the social worker and initially denied that Susan had her own phone but said that she had used the mother&#8217;s phone.  Once it was clear that Susan had access to her own phone the mother refused to take the phone from her daughter and instead started shouting at the social worker who left the room.  It was left to the FSW to attempt to reason with the mother who eventually took the phone from Susan.  </p>

The first was that after the phone had finally been removed the mother was told not to give Susan any mobile phone, including her own.  Despite the clarity of that requirement it was breached, the only thing unclear being how long it took because by the time of her removal from home Susan had obtained another phone for her personal use. The second was that because Susan had known exactly where to find the paracetamol the mother was provided with a locked box in which to hold all medication and into which the medication duly went.  The idea was that the box would be locked, which it was, and the key only available to the mother, which it was not, as the mother decided it was appropriate to place the key right by the box for ease of access.  In due course the mother was similarly advised to lock away any sharp kitchen knives because of Susan&#8217;s self-harming.  This was never done at all.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in">Despite the problems which were being generated by or in respect of Susan the tipping point in terms of removal was what occurred to Peter in early September 2024. Peter had gone to school on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September, the second day of the new school year, when the Local Authority received a referral concerning a burn to his upper leg.  Peter had not attended school on the first day of term and the school was concerned not just about the fact of the injury but also about how it appeared to have been treated due to the poor bandaging which was covering it.  During the preceding week the Local Authority had been unable to gain access to the family home, despite holding a care order, and no information had been forthcoming to either school, social services or NHS about Peter having a burn to his leg.  Peter was taken from school to hospital where he was examined and during this examination the mother explained that Peter had been sitting at the table and had pulled a cup of tea onto his leg.  It was an accident, as can happen in any household, but the subsequent failure to secure any form of health advice allied to the failure to inform the Local Authority and the apparent effort to conceal matters through school absence and bad bandaging was sufficient to cause the Local Authority to renew an earlier application to remove the children which had first been before the court in June when the mother had sought an injunction after the Local Authority had, in accordance with the procedure set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re DE [2014] EWFC 6</span>, given notice to the mother of its intentions to remove then children at that juncture.  The injunction application and concomitant discharge application had been issued but the Local Authority had reflected and indicated to the court that it was not at that point seeking immediate removal and matters progressed on the basis that the children would remain in maternal care whilst further assessments were progressed and the Local Authority considered future care plans. As will be set out below the assessment undertaken began to throw light on the problems in the family but the burn, coming as it did despite now ongoing proceedings, was the last straw in terms of living at home and the children were both removed immediately thereafter.</p>

The conclusion was that what would work best for the mother was a detailed community-based assessment to include extended observations at home.  The process did not start well with the ISW and the social worker left standing outside the family home as the mother was not in, despite the date and time of the visit having been notified in advance.  A telephone, via an interpreter, enabled the mother to explain that she had taken Peter out for a haircut and would not be returning for another half an hour.  The two were at the point of departing when the mother appeared pushing the pram with Peter in it.  Access was granted and it then became clear that Susan had been in the house on her own.  As this was only an introductory visit it was a short one but the date and time of the next visit, scheduled for the next day, was given to the mother and she repeated it back to Ms Allen.  The following day at the scheduled time the ISW duly attended but there was no answer.  Thereafter visits did take place in accordance with the proposed schedule and Ms Allen noted the positives concerning the state of the property and the efforts the mother made to assist and support Peter.  However what was also noted were the absences of Susan from the daily life of the household, either by reason of being away from the property or simply sequestered in her bedroom for much of the time.  It was clear even on this initial scoping exercise that the children each presented with very different needs.  Susan had unmet emotional needs which were driving her behaviour and Peter had significant physical needs by reasons of his delayed development allied to a complex medical history involving autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy.  Each child required better than good enough parenting and it was clear even at this early stage that the mother would be unable to manage it alone but that support would be required.</p>

By this time not only had Peter been taken to hospital following the discovery at school of the burn to his leg but further concerns had been raised when the mother was observed with bruising to her face and neck.  This had been seen on 21 August when the social worker had undertaken a now daily welfare visit.  When questioned about the matter the mother had explained that she had accidentally fallen down the stairs, that no one else had been involved and that she was fine and refused all efforts to enable her to secure medical attention. When Susan was questioned about the matter she stated that she had been out at the time but was aware that her mother had fallen. The view of the Local Authority, shared by the ISW when she was informed, was that this was concerning due to the history of domestic abuse between the mother and the father and the current unknown whereabouts of the father.  Such concerns were not alleviated by the view of the police which was that the injuries appeared more akin to an assault than an accident.  </p>

The mother&#8217;s caring capacity was sufficient, in the view of the ISW, to meet only the needs of a child under the age of two.  Thereafter as the toddler moved into childhood and their needs required a degree of nuance, insight and the ability to adapt, often quickly, to changing situations this mother was incapable of meeting those challenges.  This was evidenced not only in Peter&#8217;s accident, a situation created, if not caused, by limited understanding of supervisory arrangements but then compounded by the failure neither to seek appropriate medical care nor to even inform people thereafter.  The necessity for professional (i.e. local authority) support followed from the lack of support the mother had within the community.  Largely isolated from family and apparently devoid of friendships she coped as best she could via her own abilities and with extensive reliance upon Susan who, as a consequence and possibly also as a result, was entering a stage of her adolescence where freedom, autonomy and an absence of responsibility were her primary goals rather than helping her mother care for her brother.</p>

The removal of the children into foster care at the beginning of September had started a process of revelation as to the full extent of their different needs.  Both children had been placed in the same foster placement but it became apparent that each child had very different needs which required specific care and which militated against a joint placement.  In addition the bond between the two siblings did not appear to be strong with Susan opining that Peter was &#8216;annoying&#8217; due to his habit of messing up his room and keeping her awake at night.  Although the same could be said of many brothers and sisters at different stages of their childhood it was clear that the sibling bond, which needed to be supported, might actually be eroded by close proximity.</p>

Susan, given her safeguarding concerns, required focused intervention to support her emotional health and maintain her physical safety.  Peter needed stimulation for developmental progression, consistency in respect of appointments and other support services as well as being kept safe.  It was noteworthy in her evidence that the social worker commented that even with multiple carers operating in succession there is a view that Peter is an exhausting child to care for.  This was not said as a criticism of the child but rather meant as a compliment to the mother for managing for so long to try to meet his needs as a sole carer and also as a sole carer for his teenage sister.  The social worker&#8217;s evidence was clear: full-time care of both children in a way which is good enough for their heightened, specific needs was a full-time responsibility for a bank of professional carers and completely beyond even the most devoted of mothers, let alone one limited by her cognitive and linguistic disadvantages.</p>

Post removal physical needs were finally starting to be met, for example the full extent of tooth decay - initially flagged up by the toothache she suffered in May which resulted in the excess of paracetamol - was revealed when up to five extractions of adult teeth are likely to be required. Extraction of teeth is an immediate remedy but the attainment of emotional stability takes longer and is more challenging, contrary to what Macbeth requested one cannot simply pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow, but is every bit as important.  Susan&#8217;s troubled emotional state was a cause of her rebellious and risky behaviour and her unwillingness to accept rules from a mother from whom she felt little attachment and less love.  The chaotic nature of home life, the lack of stability, the burden of responsibility and the absence of a feeling of belonging, of feeling that she had her own place in the family, have all contributed to her deteriorating emotional state.</p>

In this case the social worker was satisfied that what was being seen was probably fairly reflected in what had been happening for far longer at home.  A mother unable to meet the needs of both children and having to prioritise and opting to do so in favour of the child who needed the sort of care she was more capable of giving, thereby failing another child whose problems compounded.</p>

The children cannot return home because to do so would be to condemn them to sub-optimal care which would have to be remedied by a revolving door of carers who would effectively render the care plan to be one of care in the presence of the mother, not care by the mother supported where necessary.  This was her view despite the very clear statements expressed by Susan of her desire to return home and her willingness to sign up to any agreement regarding her own behaviour in order to do so, of which more below.</p>

On meeting the Guardian following the conclusion of the assessment and the filing of the Local Authority&#8217;s final evidence the mother still appeared to be uncertain as to the recommendations being made and was focused instead only upon the imminent final hearing and the importance of ensuring the children were returned to her care.  During that conversation the children being at home was not only the mother&#8217;s bottom line but also her default answer to most of the questions the Guardian was attempting to ask to ensure she could garner a complete view of the mother&#8217;s position.

There was the obvious issue about the mother not understanding English but over which was laid the appreciation that she had been in an abusive relationship for an extended period of time and the process by which she was able to disengage from a position of reliance, and subservience through having her thoughts and responses framed by an external agency (her erstwhile husband) was never going to be quickly resolved or simply achieved.  Underlying both of those issues however was an uncertainty about the mother&#8217;s basic cognitive functioning and whether, even allowing for the above, she was suffering a difficulty or even a disability in the mother&#8217;s ability to absorb information, understand it, assimilate it with other information, evaluate it both singularly and as part of a whole and then use it to formulate a view upon which she could act, sure both of the options available to her and the consequences of her decision-making.</p>

The mother explained that during an argument over a phone charger Susan had thrown one of Peter&#8217;s cars at her mother and hit her on the nose leading to significant bleeding and later the bruising around the eyes which had then been seen by professionals.  The mother had not wished to create problems for Susan (or herself) and so had invented the fall story which Susan had then gone along with and in fact, if true, had lied about by claiming she was out at the time it occurred.</p>

The mother may have intimated to Susan that the sharing of passwords and some general self-restraint on her phone use would be expected but any such promise had long turned to ether and unrestrained use was swiftly re-established as the norm by the child.

The article 8 test is broader than the article 6(1) test, but in practice we doubt whether there is any real difference between the two formulations in the context with which we are concerned. There is nothing in the Strasbourg jurisprudence to which our attention has been drawn which suggests that the ECtHR considers that there is any such difference. In practice, the ECtHR&#8217;s analysis of the facts in the case-law does not seem to differ as between article 6(1) and article 8(1). This is not surprising. The focus of article 6(1) is to ensure a fair determination of civil rights and obligations by an independent and impartial tribunal. Article 8 does not dictate the form of the decision-making process that the state must put in place. But the focus of the procedural aspect of article 8 is to ensure the effective protection of an individual&#8217;s article 8 rights. To summarise, in determining what constitutes sufficient involvement in a decision-making process (article 8), for the present purposes the standards are in practice the same&#8221;</p>

However having spent some time considering the Regulations it is clear to me that they have been applied in accordance with the scheme as set out and as such I saw neither purpose nor benefit in making such a direction.

The three days of this final hearing over which I have presided will ineluctably root in my memory as three of the most depressing and miserable days I have known in my judicial career.  To have to sit and watch the pitiful sight of a party to proceedings struggling because she could barely understand what was happening in a court speaking a language she cannot learn was beyond depressing.  The mother had the benefit of an indefatigable interpreter who did her very best to ensure that the mother at least heard the words being spoken in her own language but with the greatest respect to the interpreter she was not able to assist the mother in terms of how she could best present her case, merely enable the mother to have the words she chose to use understood.</p>

When some parties have recourse to a combination of professional legal representation, a clear understanding of the issues, fluency in the language used by the court, support in court and experience of court whilst another party has none of the above it is very difficult to see how any court could ensure that that duty of equality is discharged.  The situation faced by this mother causes me to conclude that I am regrettably but entirely satisfied that insofar as it is the court&#8217;s duty to deal with cases justly and that an important aspect of that duty is to ensure that parties are on an equal footing then there has been a near total failure of that duty in this hearing.</p>

It is difficult, however, to identify within the Regulations, in contrast to the statutory factors which do present a wider and deeper scope of what should be considered, any reflection of the value of procedural fairness in achieving a just outcome as opposed to the economic cost to the public purse of that representation.  It is a system which appears to aptly reflect Wilde&#8217;s definition of the cynic as articulated by Lord Darlington referred to at the start of this judgment.  The counterpoint, of course, is to be found in the retort offered by the character of Cecil Graham, which is why I have included the full quote and not simply the better known first part.  Those whose first duty is to the proper allocation of a scarce resource such as public funds would be quick to side with Graham and point out that even values have their price and that the cost of meeting that price must not be lost in the pursuit of those values.</p>

A proper cost-benefit analysis of the economic cost of not funding the mother would almost certainly make the case for representation and not against it. Had this mother been professionally represented at the final hearing it would undoubtedly have taken less than the three days it did as the mother&#8217;s case could probably have been determined via submissions alone.  In addition, the proceedings did not simply take up three days of court time but also involved the presence of a Guardian, a social worker and three advocates, all of whose time could have been spent attending to other cases.  If only framed in economic terms any gain made in not paying for the mother&#8217;s solicitor to come to court was lost several times over by all the other costs which were incurred by the necessity of hearing the evidential case.  Even if the primary criterion is one of finance the case for representation is made out.  </p>

In my judgement a successful outcome in proceedings concerning a child is not measured by whether a parent achieves their goal but by whether the welfare of the child is properly met and the process by which that is achieved is one which has been fair to all concerned.  The less likely a parent is to achieve an aim of reunification with a child the more important it is to ensure that they can at the very least accept that the way in which that decision was taken was one in which they could effectively participate, where they could understand more than their own point of view, where there was demonstrably rational and child-centric reasoning underpinning the outcome and that even if they left the court disappointed they would be able to accept decision which had been made and so comply with the resulting order.  In these days of uncensored social media driven by furious keyboard warriors who require little encouragement to add to the reservoirs of discontent which daily flood the internet about the Family Court there is every incentive to visibly demonstrate fairness rather than bake in the appearance of unfairness.</p>

Susan was also clear that she saw any period of compliance as being measured over a long period and not counted in days or even weeks.</p>

In this she showed maturity and insight.  Threatening trouble unless you get what you want is hardly the ideal way of showing your maturity and ability to act responsibly.</p>

This is not a criticism of this mother&#8217;s commitment to her children nor her love for them, which is clear to all, but just as there can be no doubt about that there is equally no doubt, in my judgement at least, that the children need more than the mother can give them.</p>

She is not merely a child beyond her years but a child who is becoming ensnared in an adult world of harmful social media, inappropriate encounters and a lack of boundaries designed not to reign her in but to give her a foundation upon which she can develop safely and so fulfil her potential.  The care order is what is needed now to generate the necessary levels of control, of parameters and of prohibitions which will keep her safe, enable her to recognise the harm of her previous actions and set her upon a road to better realisation of why untrammelled freedom is never a good pathway for a young teenager.  In short the care order with all its prohibitions and restrictions is a positive assist to her welfare and its absence would be a detriment.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.12in">Peter is at the other end of the spectrum.  He needs his care order because he needs activity, stimulation, careful management all on a daily basis.  The absence of a care order would condemn him to long periods sitting in his chair and fewer interactions with individuals which are necessary to stimulate him and so enable him to progress.  Peter has been described as a changed child since his removal into care and the changes are only for the better.  Peter is calmer, safer and more stable in his current environment.  Whilst he undoubtedly misses his mother Peter is benefitting from consistency of routine, enhanced stimulation and secure arrangements.  For a child in Peter&#8217;s situation the importance of a settled, stimulating routine provided by available carers who are attuned to the needs of the child is invaluable and this is what this care order brings him.  The discharge of the care order would enable Peter to return to the care of his mother but it would be the care arrangement which the mother has shown she can offer and this is the same one in which he sustained an injury, which was untreated and which has failed to arrest his deteriorating developmental progress.  Although the discharge of the care order would enable Peter to feel the full effect of his mother&#8217;s love it would also expose him to her limited capacity to care and whilst the former is invaluable the latter must be avoided if his welfare is to be maximised.</p>

There is no positive benefit for the children in terms of their overall welfare in the discharge of this order and a real likelihood of a return to which has so clearly not worked for them.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.12in">To address directly Susan&#8217;s view of being willing to abide by any restrictions to achieve a return home I say that to place her under such pressure would be wrong and to expect her to live a life without making a mistake or acting spontaneously would be wholly unrealistic.  To the chagrin of the adults around them teenagers continually push the boundaries placed upon them as they transition from dutiful children into adults with agency and an appreciation of the responsibilities of independence.  That process usually involves a considerable amount of friction in most homes as the teenager seeks to explore the world as it starts to open up before them on their terms and in their way.  It takes a good while for both sides to reach a new accommodation on the other side of maturity and emotional bruises acquired on the way (on both sides) are commonplace.  Susan would be denied that opportunity and in so doing would miss out on an important aspect of her development.  Left to her own devices whilst in the care of her mother she put many feet wrong. Any requirement to toe the line if returned to her mother&#8217;s care would either end in spectacular failure or simply stunt her emotional development and leave her as a young adult as needing to catch up on all that was not allowed to happen during those important years.  Either way Susan would lose out.</p>

Courts exist to provide not just an outcome to a dispute but a just outcome which reflects the importance of arriving at a fair, transparent and reasoned decision which respects individuals&#8217; rights through a process which itself is fair.  Access to justice should be about more than merely allowing a person to be in the courtroom and to have an opportunity to ask questions and speak directly to the judge.  Important principles of natural justice such as equality of arms and effective participation are not honoured merely by so doing.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.12in">I end this judgment with a further nod to Oscar Wilde.  After his own experience of incarceration Wilde wrote his famous poem <span style="font-style:italic">The Ballad of Reading Gaol </span>in which<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>he sought to articulate the despair and depression of incarceration.  In a memorable phrase he wrote about the slow passage of time for those imprisoned &#8216;&#8230;<span style="font-style:italic;color:#181818">each day is like a year</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-style:italic;color:#181818">&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#181818">A year whose days are long.&#8217;</span>  What Wilde described as being felt by those serving a criminal sentence might equally describe the feelings of a parent living with a separation from a child ordered by a Family Court.  It is not easy to see how our funding system might be altered so as to prioritise the value to the individual of representation in any particular case but our family justice system would be better served if it could.</p>
