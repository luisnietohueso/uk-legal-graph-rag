      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The ET used too narrow a definition of what could amount to a protected act and did not analyse in sufficient detail the context in which the complaint relied upon as a protected act was made. In particular, part of the context is the way in which the respondent would have understood the complaint. Here, where the employer would know that the claimant was the only black employee and the complaint was specifically about difference in treatment, those were matters that should form part of the evidential consideration. It was not clear that in dealing with the claimant&#8217;s grievance and appeal hearings the ET approached that evidence with that contextual approach in mind. </span></p>

In the first grievance letter, the ET1 at paragraph 19 refers to a complaint of being treated differently to the rest of the staff; the second letter referring to a complaint of nothing being done in respect of the grievance and the bullying complaint.  The claimant had set out earlier in the ET1 that she was the only black employee and that she had been bullied where others had not been.</span></p>

She was considered a good employee and had transferred from a store at Charing Cross to the Sheerness store in January 2018.  The claimant was the only non-white member of staff employed at the respondent store on full-time basis, with the only other non-white employee being a relief pharmacist.  The relief pharmacist stood in when Ms Suteu, the pharmacist about whom the claimant complains, was carrying out clinics.  The claimant&#8217;s performance in 2018 and 2019 was sufficient for her to be nominated for an award in that latter year.</span></p>

She did not, however, suggest at any point within the grievance letter that she was being discriminated against because of her race, nor did she suggest that she attributed Ms Suto&#8217;s treatment to her race.&#8221;</span></p>

Rather, it was because the claimant knowingly interrupted her conversation. In our judgment, that did not suggest there was any preconception about the claimant based on her race.&#8221;</span></p>

Referring to the Employment Tribunal judgment at paragraphs 126 and 127, she made the point that the section does not require an express allegation of race discrimination. Paragraph 126 seems to point out that making a complaint which does not mention race is not sufficient.  That, read with paragraph 127, seems to narrow the approach of the ET, particularly in the way that it had quoted from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Fullah</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">.

Ms Godwins submitted that case law sets out that the ET is required to consider the context in which complaints are made when assessing whether there is a protected act. It is argued that this approach is particularly important in circumstances where there is no express reference to the protected characteristic.

By focusing on the claimant not using the words &#8220;race&#8221; or &#8220;discrimination&#8221; the ET failed to approach the complaint as it should have and, thereby, clouded what it should have seen.

True it is that the legislation must be construed in a sense favourable to its important public purpose. But there is another principle involved - also essential to that same purpose. Charges of race or sex discrimination are hurtful and damaging and not always easy to refute. In justice, therefore, to those against whom they are brought, it is vital that discrimination, including victimisation, should be defined in a language sufficiently precise to enable people to know where they stand before the law.  Precision of language is also necessary to prevent the valuable purpose of combating discrimination from becoming frustrated or brought into disrepute through the use of language which encourages unscrupulous or vexatious recourse to the machinery provided by the discrimination Acts.  The interpretation proposed by Mr Allen would involve an imprecision of language leaving employers in a state of uncertainty as to how they should respond to a particular complaint and would place the machinery of the Act at serious risk of abuse. It is better, and safer, to give the words of the subsection their clear and literal meaning. The allegation relied on need not state explicitly that an act of discrimination has occurred - that is clear from the words in brackets in section 4(1)(d) that refers to an earlier Act. All that is required is that the allegation relied on should have asserted facts capable of mounting in law to an act of discrimination by an employer within the terms of section 6(2)(b). The facts alleged by the complaint in this case were incapable in law of amounting to an act of discrimination by the commissioner because they were not done by him, and they cannot (because the alleged perpetrator was not acting in the course of his employment) be treated as done by him for the purposes of section 41..&#8221;</span></p>

If that finding of fact is justified then there could be no victimisation under section 27 of the Equality Act - each of the protected acts referred to in section 27(2) is made referable to this Act. The complaint must be of conduct which interferes with a characteristic protected by the Act, such as race, not to a matter not protected by the Act, such as public interest disclosure. The only relevant protected characteristic asserted here was the Claimant&#8217;s race.  Similarly, insofar as the claim alleged acts to which the Race Relations Act 1976 applied, victimisation under section 2 is defined entirely by reference to the 1976 Act.  I would accept that it is not necessary that the complaint referred to race using that very word. But there must be something sufficient about the complaint to show that it is a complaint to which at least potentially the Act applies.  As Mr Davies points out, the tribunal found as a fact the Claimant did not attribute any treatment (at the time) to the fact that he is British of Pakistani origin. That finding of fact alone means there is no evidence that an employer, seeking to cause detriment to the Claimant as a result of making the complaints he did, could have been victimising him for a complaint made by reference to, under, or associated with the relevant Act.  At his appeal in respect of the final written warning in September 2010 it was not disputed that when the Claimant said, as he did, that he had he had been discriminated against, the chief executive who was chairing the meeting asked him on what grounds he had been discriminated against.  His response was that it was because another manager believed he had committed the offence even after he was acquitted.&#8221;</span></p>

It may, and perhaps usually will, be a complaint made on such a ground. However, here, the tribunal was entitled to reach the decision it did, since the Claimant on unchallenged evidence had been invited to say that he was alleging discrimination on the grounds of race. Instead of accepting that invitation he had stated, in effect, that his complaint was rather of unfair treatment generally.&#8221;</span></p>

However, the judges of this are the Employment Tribunal, who were enjoined to look not just at the documentation but at the context, in particular, the context in which the Claimant made explicit claims a year later of race discrimination, a claim made by an articulate, well-educated person knowing clearly what the language is. There is no basis in either of the two emanations that he puts forward for a complaint of race discrimination.

In order for a complaint to be a protected act it must meet the statutory form required by the Equality Act, in other words a complaint about something which, if proven, would be a contravention of the Act. That means a complaint in this case must be about race discrimination: which could be direct race discrimination or race harassment in the circumstances and, in meeting that definition, the protected act must be considered in the factual context in which it was made.  Considering the context, it appears to me that what is set out, for instance, by Waite LJ in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Waters</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">, is that the allegation relied on need not state explicitly that an act of discrimination has occurred.

Although it will usually be the case that that the Equality Act element is made explicit it is not necessary that it should. An ET would be entitled to reach a decision based on context that the word &#8220;race&#8221; is unnecessary where it is held that the factual matters that are relied upon meet the defiinition.

It would be understood by the employer, in part, because of the general facts about the employee and the place of work, which the employer would know of in any event.  In terms, that the employee&#8217;s complaint should be considered by the ET by examining the way that it would be understood by the employer.

That might be a fair way of beginning an explanation of the law. However, what is then set out at paragraph 127 appears to be the ET stating that the phrasing of a complaint, which has some similarities to with that of the claimant&#8217;s complaints, was not a protected act.  That appears to be the ET, in its application of the law, indicating that it considers the narrowness of the complaint made by the claimant sets the limitations of the complaint. It appears this is what the ET is exploring when it looks at its similarity to the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Fullah </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">complaint and not any broader context. It appears to consider the phrase but not the context in which the phrase was made.</span></p>

The ET found facts which demonstrate the context.  What is not clear, in my judgment, is that they have analysed those facts as part of the context in which the claimant&#8217;s complaints would have been understood by the respondent.  Paragraph 58 of the judgment is concerning in this respect.  It appears to be the ET concentrating on the fact the claimant failed to mention race or discrimination.  The ET had found that the claimant was accused of shouting. It had some evidence that this was connected to race in the notes of the grievance meeting.  </span></p>

This along with the claimant not raising in her initial appeal letter the issue of discrimination as a complaint that had not been dealt with at the grievance stage, were said to be factual matters which the ET had in mind in concluding there was no protected act.  However, the way in which the law is expressed by the ET makes these arguments less forceful than they otherwise would be as it is not clear that the context was part of the ET reasons.</span></p>

Whilst, in my judgment, this does not reach the level of perversity, it does call into question the ET&#8217;s approach to the context evidence. There is clearly, within paragraph 175, an acceptance that there had been an accusation of shouting. However, at paragraph 186 there is no reference to what the ET found was said by the claimant at the meeting. The ET finding in broad terms only that the claimant did not allege &#8220;a breach of the Equality Act.&#8221;  It seems to me that the ET is not dealing with the facts that it had found at that stage but was instead considering only broader labels. When consideration is given to what the ET sets out at paragraph 58, the way it describes the law in paragraph 127, and those difficulties between paragraph 175 and paragraph 186, it appears to me that it is an indication that the ET not only described the law in paragraphs 126 and 127 in too narrow a way but applied the law in that narrow manner.</span></p>

However, when the following is considered: that the claimant was the only black employee; she had pointed out that she was being treated differently as part of a grievance; where the ET found as fact that she was accused of shouting (relied upon as part of her original grievance); that the grievance meeting notes at a very minimum raised as an issue that shouting may be connected to black women in a negative way and where  this was an issue that was reinforced on appeal. These facts provide a broad context which the ET was required to consider and, more importantly, analyse when coming to conclusions.  It is not apparent, in my judgment, that the ET saw that as a requirement given its description of the law.</span></p>

That understanding would include the factors which were known to the respondent.  Those factors would include the racial makeup of its workforce, it would include what is in the grievance letter about a difference in treatment. It would also include the discussions at grievance meetings.</span></p>

The ET found that not raising the matter in the appeal pointed to the claimant not having raised the issue earlier.  However, in my judgment, that depends on the ET&#8217;s view as to what raising the issue means.  In the broader context, if, as appears from the description of the law, the ET is confining a complaint to raising specifically race or discrimination in the grievance complaint, then its understanding of what the claimant was raising at the grievance meeting and the appeal meeting would be limited. That limited view would exist because of its narrow view of what could amount to a complaint.  On that basis, the ET would not be exploring the factual matters to the extent necessary. Further to this, the ET have apparently not considered race discrimination raised by the claimant in the appeal.  This could have been, of course, that the claimant was raising a new issue which she had not mentioned before.  Equally, however, it could have been evidence that the claimant had raised this as an issue in the grievance and used it as support for a conclusion that race has been raised.</span></p>

It is on that basis that I would uphold the claimant&#8217;s appeal in this case.  I will take submissions at this stage as to what the next step ought to be.</span></p>
