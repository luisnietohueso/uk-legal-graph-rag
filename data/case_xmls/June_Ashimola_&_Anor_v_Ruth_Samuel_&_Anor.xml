	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in">This is an unusual probate claim in that the deceased says she is very much alive. In essence, D1, Ms Ruth Samuel, holds a probate power of attorney in Form PA12 for D2, Mr Bakare Olatoye Lasisi, who says he married C1, Ms June Ashimola, in 1993. They say Ms Ashimola died in Nigeria on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2019, intestate. A grant of Letters of Administration (&#8220;the Grant&#8221;) to her Estate was issued to Ms Samuel as Mr Lasisi&#8217;s attorney, on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2022, with a gross value stated at &#163;347,000 gross and &#163;172,000 net.</p>

This was purchased by Ms Ashimola in July 2003 and registered in her sole name. The root of this claim is a long running battle or campaign waged by a Mr Tony Ashikodi for control and/or ownership of the Property. Ms Ashimola left the UK for Nigeria in about October 2018 and has not returned since. This claim involves wide-ranging allegations of fraud, forgery, impersonation and intimidation, some of which have been established as I will turn to.</p>

References [  ] are to paragraph numbers in this judgment unless the context appears otherwise. As the evidence focused on various documents including photographs and identity documents I include where appropriate the trial bundle reference. Certain important images from the trial bundle are reproduced in the Annex to this judgment. When I refer to the parties&#8217; advocates jointly I use the term &#8220;Counsel&#8221;.  I set out below my criticisms of the way the trial was conducted, the issues, the law, the evidence of fact, my findings of fact, certain miscellaneous matters and my determination of the issues.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in">The majority of the key documents in this claim such as, for example, the marriage certificate of C1 and D2 are disputed as forgeries whether of the document itself or the signatures they bear or both. I have treated all such documents as suspect as the provenance is, in the main, uncertain and many were not proved before me in that originals were not produced at trial, their makers did not give oral evidence, nor were notices under the Civil Evidence Act 1972 served, nor Notices to Admit. Accordingly, I have had to draw adverse inferences as to certain documents, evidence and events involving the main protagonists.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in">I appreciate that preparation for and conduct of a trial especially in situations as obtain here is rarely easy or straightforward. Trials frequently create substantial workloads, often with unexpected points of law, evidence or procedure arising both immediately before or during the trial. Various matters may at times not prepared as best as they could or should be. But that is litigation. I usually endeavour, on the basis that the legal teams and litigants in person are doing their very best, not to take points of procedure, preparation or practice unless there is material prejudice or it affects my consideration of the evidence, the weight I should attach to it and my judgment. But what happened here was substantially beyond the norm and needs to be set out as the background to my assessment of the evidence and determination of the issues.</p>

I stopped the hearing and requested the person to identify and explain himself. He did so. Initially he denied making hand gestures but then accepted he had done so, his intention being to get the witness to answer the question. I explained that conduct was wholly unacceptable. His fulsome apology was sincere. I said I would take it no further but any future instances of interfering with evidence would be met by that person&#8217;s removal from the court and reporting of them to their regulatory body.</p>

The electronic version consists of 4 separate PDFs as apparently the total (only some 650 pages) was over size for transmission. That is easily remedied using appropriate software or drop box. The hard copy has 4 separate sections with a different index and numbering for each. It is difficult to navigate and follow. A hard copy of the authorities bundle was directed by me but not provided until I received that of the Defendants in time for the last day of trial. Chief Master Shuman in her Additional Order of 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2024 (&#8220;the Additional Order&#8221;) required the parties to cross reference the numerous witness statements to the documents.

I asked him to insert the proper references and refile, hopefully over lunch that day. That did not happen then nor during trial but eventually on Monday 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2024 a revised skeleton was filed by, I noted, Mr Tony Ashikodi which is of some concern. That new version still has 4 incorrect references, one reference removed and 3 new ones added.</p>

I pointed out to him that the like applied to the statements served by the Defendants, and that I was not going to review all parties&#8217; statements during trial to ascertain the position and, if necessary, apply an appropriate sanction as that would only extend the trial if not result in another adjournment (the original trial listed for October 2024 having been adjourned.) Further, there could be serious prejudice to a party if the evidence of that witness was ruled impermissible.</p>

I responded that the same applied to his clients and again it would not assist the proper running of this trial, nor would it be proportionate nor accord with the Overriding Objective to pursue that breach by both parties. Further, the indices to the trial bundles in the main helpfully indicate which party has produced each document and whether the authenticity is disputed &#8211; therefore the parties here proceeded on a &#8220;shared assumption&#8221; &#8211; see the note at CPR 32.19.1 referring to the decision of Mr Richard Salter KC sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court <span style="font-style:italic">McGann v Bisping </span>[2017] EWHC 2951 (Comm).</p>

The equity in the Property according to the HMRC Schedule IHT421 filed by Ms Samuel is about &#163;172,000 but that is subject to at least one charge besides the mortgage the value of which is not known. Apparently the mortgage is not currently being paid and possession proceedings may have been or are about to be commenced, although there was no independent evidence of this before me. Both parties at my request filed current summaries of costs in Form N260. Those costs total approximately &#163;151,000 and so almost equal the remaining equity and may by now exceed it, so are disproportionate.</p>

I have considered carefully all the evidence, law and submissions but I do not need to deal with all of them. To do otherwise and explore and determine every contested document and issue of fact does not accord with the Overriding Objective at CPR 1(1)(2).

The Claimants&#8217; issues included all those below and in addition whether Mr Lasisi existed, was married to Ms Ashimola and whether the power of attorney he gave to Ms Ashimola was forged. Those of the Defendants included just 1 and 2 below. I said the latter was insufficient and suggested a revised list of issues which Dr Kasi agreed to and Mr Ebuzoeme did not object. Until I received the latter&#8217;s Closing Submissions (&#8220;Closings&#8221;) I considered the Issues subject to what I refer to below were agreed, and the trial proceeded on that basis.

Therefore, the question of whether the marriage was real or not underpins not only the Grant but also the claim to the Property. I would also distinguish the position from that in <span style="font-style:italic">Jacobs </span>at [23] as here Ms Ashimola was direct and unequivocal in her witness statement; she had never heard of either of the Defendants until she saw the Grant.</p>

Dr Kasi then introduced the reference to s.121 of the Act in his skeleton.

Mr Ebuzoeme objected in his further written submissions, submitting that this was not pleaded or in evidence or in the skeleton arguments and that &#8220;&#8230;the court cannot unilaterally create an issue not pleaded nor as an extension of the Claimants&#8217; issue 3&#8230;the only reason the claimants want the Grant&#8230;to be revoked is that June Ashimola is alive and nothing more.&#8221; Mr Shomotun did not object.</p>

There is no new issue as that is as pleaded in the Claim Form and Particulars of Claim. What I think Mr Ebuzoeme is concerned over is the possibility of the Grant being revoked by me whether or not the Claimants succeed in proving on the balance of probabilities that Ms Ashimola is alive. I will deal with that in my determination of the Issues.</p>

He has no material interest in these proceedings. Mr Shomotun said he had known Ms Ashimola after she came to the UK in about 1999. Then in about 2001 she moved into his family house. He was asked if he accepted she was dead, which he denied, saying he last saw her in Nigeria over June/July 2024 for about 2 weeks. He identified her from her Nigerian passport number A10266959, issued on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2019, expiry date 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2024, at pages B/87-103 (&#8220;the Expired Passport&#8221;).

He said he knew Mr Tony Ashikodi well as he is his brother-in-law, and that following a trial at Woolwich Crown Court in September 1996 Mr Tony Ashikodi was convicted of conspiring to and/or obtaining property by deception. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison. Mr Shomotun&#8217;s evidence was not challenged on this conviction and indeed Mr Ashikodi accepted he had served that prison sentence.</p>

He was asked when he was given the power of attorney but he could not remember. He did say that it was just before he attended at the Land Registry who wanted Ms Ashimola to attend with her identity documents but she was unable to as she was in Nigeria. Mr Ebuzoeme put to Mr Shomotun that his wife, Ms Justina Ashikodi, attended that meeting and pretended to be Ms Ashimola, which he denied, saying they produced at that meeting the power of attorney in his favour.</p>

On the first page it states that it was prepared by Ms Julliette Menge, who appears to have affixed to that front page her stamp of the Nigerian Bar Association, stated to be &#8220;Valid Till March 2018&#8221;. On page B/67 appears a signature, very similar to that of Ms Ashimola in the Expired Passport. The signature was affixed in the presence of, according to two stamps of his, one Chief Oluseyi Oyebolu, &#8220;Legal Practitioner &amp; Notary Public&#8221;, who also signed.</p>

I can only presume Mr Ebuoeme was working off an incorrect page reference in his poor version of the trial bundle. Mr Shomotun was then asked about Ms Menge and her statement that she had not prepared this PoA. He, wholly understandably, answered he did not know who prepared it or signed it.</p>

When asked if he spoke to Ms Ashimola he confirmed he did but refused to produce copies of his telephone records saying they were personal. I think this was a misunderstanding as under re-examination he said he could disclose the logs of those calls, but that he did not have them with him. He was asked if he accepted he and his wife were the &#8220;&#8230;prime movers of this web of deceit&#8221; which he denied.</p>

She said it was in Nigeria, two years ago, accompanied by her husband. When asked why Ms Ashimola was not here, she said she didn&#8217;t know, but that maybe she was hiding and fearing for her life.</p>

However, her recollection at times was poor or simply wrong. For example, she was asked in cross examination about her knowledge of or relationship with Mr Lasisi (the parties agree he is also known as Mr Bakare). She said she first spoke to him in late 2019 but did not know him until after the death of Ms Ashimola. Dr Kasi asked how she became his attorney and she replied she knew June Ashimola very well <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">before</span> she got married as they were socially friendly, in a group that went to each other&#8217;s homes, having BBQs and so on.</p>

That part of Ms Samuel&#8217;s evidence must therefore be wrong, and there is no evidence of Ms Samuel being in Nigeria at the material or for that matter any time or Ms Ashimola being in the UK.</p>

When asked who told her this she tried to avoid the question by saying it was her feeling that it was what Ms Ashimola wanted. She was clearly uncomfortable giving this evidence.</p>

She also knew that he knew Ms Ashimola. Then when asked about the Property and whether she knew of Mr Tony Ashikodi&#8217;s involvement with it and two court or tribunal cases against Ms Ashimola she said she was not aware.</p>

She confirmed she signed this on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2023 but when asked further about it she said again she could not say anything more as she was &#8220;&#8230;not legally minded.&#8221; </p>

Asked for what purpose, she said she signed it as Mr Tony Ashikodi was acting on her behalf as she was always in the Caribbean, (in contradiction to her earlier evidence of her annual visits) so she signed it, so he could deal with all matters concerning the Property, such as paying the mortgage, so the tenants would be secure.

Dr Kasi put to her that Mr Tony Ashikodi gave her the forms and asked her to sign it. She said she didn&#8217;t sit down with him and sign forms together. I note that she did not deny the question outright. It was put to her that then the forms came from him, she signed and returned them to him. She answered &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say they came from him&#8221;. Again there was no outright denial. I do not accept her evidence in this respect.

That is an especially serious attempt to transfer the Property of which she was not just aware but she attempted to silence all objections to the transfer. Likewise the statement at [45(3)] above was served to further her and Mr Ashikodi&#8217;s interests in these proceedings.

That witness statement contains detailed submissions on various legal matters. Ms Samuel was referred to [35] wherein she cited two Supreme Court of Nigeria decisions concerning Nigerian law as to powers of attorney. Dr Kasi said she must be legally minded to have made those submissions. Her reply was that she disagreed, but that she was good at researching &#8211; she had &#8220;Googled it&#8221;. I do not accept that. Her correspondence and witness statements show a considerable familiarity with the laws here and, it appears, in Nigeria. I consider her excuse that she was not legally minded was used by her when faced with something she could not or would not explain, or that someone else had drafted on her behalf many if not just about all the documents she had submitted. I find the latter the most likely explanation in all the circumstances.</p>

In particular, she made every effort over months to avoid disclosing the documents she submitted to obtain the Grant, from which her attempted transfer of the Property arose. The threat of an Unless Order resulted in her disclosure, but even then she attempted to mislead the court in her evidence.</p>

He said he did not know, but that &#8220;she is the administrator and he is a beneficiary.&#8221; Mr Shomotun asked how Mr Lasisi could appoint someone he did not know as his attorney. Mr Ashikodi said he knew someone who appointed a solicitor as administrator so here Mr Lasisi appointed Ms Samuel. Ms Samuel in her evidence was similarly vague (and unconvincing) as to how she came to be appointed attorney for Mr Lasisi as I found in [51] above. </p>

This does not bear examination; both of them in my judgment are trying to mislead the court. The connection must have been through Mr Ashikodi. Earlier when asked how he knew Mr Lasisi, he said &#8220;...in 2017 he was there &#8211; in photographs disclosed during the proceedings in the Crown Court to show him and June [Ms Ashimola] with him&#8221;. This answer was again deliberately vague, unhelpful and unspecific but does show he put forward some tenuous link. To do otherwise would stretch the bounds of credibility, whether or not he actually exists.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.75in">Likewise there is no explanation as to why Mr Lasisi did not participate in these proceedings after service of his Defence Statement. I refer to my findings as to his evidence at [81-83] above, and Mr Ebuzoeme&#8217;s response to my closing submissions query at [84]. In particular, Mr Ebuzoeme submitted that the evidence of Mr Lasisi would not assist the Claimants nor would it be adverse to the Defendants. He has therefore had his chance and decided not to tender his evidence. He cannot revisit that as it suits him.</p>
