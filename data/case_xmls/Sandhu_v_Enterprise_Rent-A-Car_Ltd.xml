The hearing of those claims by an Employment Judge and two lay members lasted four days in June and July 2022. She and the Respondent were represented by counsel. In a detailed reserved judgment sent to the parties on 4 October 2022 (&#8216;the Judgment&#8217;), the ET dismissed Ms Sandhu&#8217;s claims. She then appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal (&#8216;the EAT&#8217;). The EAT dismissed her appeal. She now appeals, on a point of law, from the EAT&#8217;s order, with the permission of Singh LJ. </span></p>

Ms Slarks represented the Respondent. I thank counsel for their oral and written submissions. For the reasons given in this judgment, I would dismiss her appeal. As I will explain, the ET did not err in law in its approach to her harassment claim and gave legally adequate reasons for its decision that she had not been unfairly dismissed.</span></p>

The judgment is the outcome, therefore, not only of a hearing of four days of evidence and submissions, but of a further day&#8217;s discussion of Ms Sandhu&#8217;s case by a legally qualified Employment Judge (&#8216;EJ&#8217;) and two lay members. It is relatively unusual for lay members to sit in the ET these days. In my experience they tend to sit mostly on discrimination claims. This point is significant. Ms Sandhu&#8217;s claims were considered and decided by the &#8216;industrial jury&#8217; which is so often referred to in the old cases, when industrial tribunals always consisted of a legally qualified </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">chairman</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> and two lay members. The &#8216;industrial jury&#8217;, as long as it does not err in law, is particularly well-suited to making the broad evaluative judgments which section 98 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (&#8216;the ERA&#8217;) requires it to make (see further, paragraphs 53, and 71-80, below).</span></p>

On 11 June 2019, Ms Sandhu&#8217;s draft list of issues was sent to the ET and to the Respondent. In December 2019 the ET had decided that the list accurately reflected the issues in the claim, and produced a text for that list. In paragraph 6 of the Judgment the ET said that that text &#8216;very closely replicated that in the 11 June 2019 list of issues&#8217;. The ET struck out one issue, which had later been withdrawn by Ms Sandhu (paragraph 5.3.6 of the list). With that exception, the issues considered by the ET in the judgment were therefore closely aligned with Ms Sandhu&#8217;s analysis of the issues.  The issues were listed in two groups.</span></p>

The ET had earlier decided (see paragraph 4.3 of the Judgment) that Ms Sandhu&#8217;s claims did not include claims based on her own disability. They were, instead, only claims based on her father&#8217;s disability. Such claims are known as claims of &#8216;associative discrimination&#8217;. Ms Sandhu relied on eight separate incidents (which were listed). She claimed that they were incidents of direct discrimination and/or of harassment related to her father&#8217;s disability.

There were 611 pages of documents. Ms Sandhu relied on two witness statements she had made and on the statements of seven other witnesses. The Respondent relied on four witness statements. The Respondent did not cross-examine any witnesses other than Ms Sandhu. She would have liked to cross-examine Mr Astill, who no longer worked for the Respondent. The Respondent had not called him or made any application for a witness summons. The ET read his statement but gave it &#8216;very little weight&#8217; (paragraph 14). There was a dispute about whether the Respondent had complied with its disclosure obligations. The ET heard evidence and cross-examination about this. It was not persuaded that the Respondent had deliberately breached any orders, or that &#8216;there was anything implausible about the explanation for why some appraisal records were missing, even though some earlier ones were still available&#8217;.

The Respondent is a car rental company. It operates throughout the United Kingdom. Ms Sandhu started work for the Respondent in 1999 as an accounting assistant. At that stage, the Billing Department consisted of one accountant and four or five assistants. The Respondent had about 100 employees then (paragraph 21). The ET described Ms Sandhu&#8217;s duties in paragraph 18. She was given more responsibilities over time (paragraph 19). After about two years, she became a payroll accounting assistant. The ET described her new duties. Her appraisals were good and she was given pay rises (paragraph 20).</span></p>

Her duties changed again (paragraph 21). She worked hard and met her deadlines. In about 2010 she was promoted to payroll supervisor. She thought that she was expected to do all her original duties and to supervise another employee. The ET accepted the evidence of Mr Young that he genuinely believed that a supervisor was not required to do everything herself, but rather to manage the teams, including allocating work to them, so as to ensure that the work was done (paragraph 22).</span></p>

She gave examples in her witness statement. The ET set out the Respondent&#8217;s grading system in paragraph 25. There are five grades, from &#8216;unsatisfactory&#8217; - (1) - to &#8216;outstanding&#8217; - (5). An outstanding employee &#8216;consistently and significantly surpasses job requirements. Role model for others&#8217;. An unsatisfactory employee &#8216;is unable to perform job requirements. Immediate improvement required&#8217;. The ET described the review form which the Respondent used in detail. Several questions were asked, and a tick was put in one of the five boxes. There were nine headings on the form, reflecting various qualities, such as &#8216;personal characteristics&#8217;, &#8216;initiative and application&#8217;, &#8216;problem analysis and decision-making&#8217;, &#8216;quantity&#8217; and &#8216;quality&#8217; of work, and &#8216;leadership&#8217;. There were six or so questions under each heading, and a space for the reviewer&#8217;s comments. The final heading was &#8216;overall performance&#8217; for the relevant period. There was a space for the reviewer&#8217;s conclusion and a section headed &#8216;goals to be accomplished&#8217; with, &#8216;(in many cases) specific &#8220;expected completion dates&#8221;&#8217;.</span></p>

The ET rejected any suggestion that the Respondent had deliberately suppressed more favourable reviews. That did not mean that the ET was bound to hold that none of the missing reviews was better than those it had seen.  Neither side had shown, either, that there were better, or worse reviews. The Respondent had not, in any event, argued that there were worse reviews (paragraph 31).</span></p>

Ms Sandhu was given an electronic version so that she could comment (paragraph 32). Her comments in her witness statements about her two reviews in 2014 put too favourable a gloss on their contents, as the ET explained in paragraph 33. Both sets of overall comments did praise her, but that was balanced by more negative remarks, which the ET quoted in detail. The second review recorded that there had been significant progress in those areas. The ET recorded the individual scores in each of the reviews in paragraphs 33.4 and 33.5. These two reviews did not persuade the ET that Ms Sandhu &#8216;had had unceasingly positive appraisal outcomes&#8217; before the &#8216;requires improvement items&#8217; which the ET went on to consider later in the Judgment (paragraph 34).</span></p>

The Respondent suggested to Ms Sandhu that she should report to him. She objected, because she had had &#8216;bad experiences&#8217; reporting to Ms Miles. She wanted to continue to report to Mr Young. That manager left after a few months, and Ms Sandhu continued to report to Mr Young. In about July 2016, the Respondent appointed a new payroll manager, Mr Astill. Ms Sandhu told Mr Young that she did not want to report to Mr Astill. He told her that &#8216;temporarily&#8217; she could continue to report to him, but that the longer-term plan was that she should report to the payroll manager (paragraph 36).</span></p>

He said that the Respondent was now &#8216;far bigger and must operate like a professional large business&#8217;. If the department missed deadlines, there were many consequences elsewhere. The team had to understand that they had to meet their targets, which could only be achieved through Ms Sandhu&#8217;s leadership and organisation.

He made negative remarks under other headings (paragraphs 47 and 48). All the comments in the review expressed his genuine opinions. Ms Sandhu was given &#8216;clear and specific information&#8217; and, whether or not she agreed with his views, the ET was &#8216;satisfied that she knew that he was telling her that improvement was still required&#8217; (paragraph 49).</span></p>

In paragraph 76, the ET considered the allegation that Ms Johal had made a sarcastic comment such as &#8216;Good afternoon&#8217; when Ms Sandhu arrived. The ET accepted that Ms Johal&#8217;s evidence (that she could not remember making such a remark) was truthful. The ET nevertheless accepted that the remark was made. Mr Young remembered speaking to Ms Johal and telling her that the remark was inappropriate. Ms Johal did not know that Ms Sandhu had been to the hospital or that her father had cancer. Ms Sandhu suggested that Ms Johal had asked her team where Ms Sandhu was. In that regard, Ms Sandhu was relaying, not what she had heard herself, but what she had been told by her team. Even if the suggestion was true, it did not support an inference that someone had told Ms Johal about her father&#8217;s illness.</span></p>

Ms Sandhu had been giving her father some medicine. She should have given Mr Astill the end-of-month information by 11 am. She could not hand it over that morning, because she was not in the office. She had, however, told the Respondent that the information was ready the day before, but no-one had collected it then. Mr Astill got the information about ten minutes late on 27 March. He reported that to Mr Young. There was no evidence that Mr Astill knew what Ms Sandhu had been doing that morning, or why she had not handed the information to him that morning. The ET repeated that it was not satisfied that Mr Astill knew about her father&#8217;s illness. Other than Mr Astill&#8217;s report to Mr Young, &#8216;there were no specific adverse consequences for&#8217; Ms Sandhu.</span></p>

In her statement, Ms Keely said she did not know what deadline Ms Sandhu was talking about. The ET was not satisfied on the evidence that the deadline was for the provision of the same kind of information. Even though the ET had given Mr Astill&#8217;s statement little weight, he made the &#8216;obviously true&#8217; point that some deadlines are easier to move than others. On her own account, Ms Sandhu did not ask for an extension of time, nor was any such request refused. The suggestion, rather, was that Mr Astill was unreasonable, and motivated by her father&#8217;s disability, when he failed to co-operate with her on 26 March by not taking the information from her then, and unreasonable then to report her to Mr Young when she had told him that the information was available the day before. It had not been suggested that Ms Keely was subject to any performance management in March 2018 (paragraph 78). </span></p>

The Respondent&#8217;s case was that it was protected by privilege and it did not waive that privilege. The discussion was covered to some extent by the evidence, and featured in the list of issues. In paragraph 83, the ET listed the material over which the Respondent did not claim privilege. In paragraph 84, the ET quoted what Mr Young said in paragraphs 68 and 69 of his witness statement. By March 2018, he thought that it was &#8216;likely to be impossible&#8217; to resolve Ms Sandhu&#8217;s refusal to change her reporting line and her performance issues. He had not taken &#8216;a settled decision&#8217; that she needed to be dismissed but considered it was worth exploring whether she would agree to leave. In short, she was offered a settlement agreement. She was not forced to take it, nor was she told that she would be dismissed if she did not. She was offered some time off to think about it. According to Mr Young, she returned to work on 3 May 2018. The ET preferred Ms Sandhu&#8217;s evidence that she did not do so (see paragraph 40, below).</span></p>

The ET considered that the handwritten notes of the meeting were reasonably accurate. It lasted 105 minutes. She was asked at the start whether she was happy to continue alone. She said that she was. She did not specifically say that her recent performance had been affected by her father&#8217;s illness, or by the time she had spent looking after him. She referred to an incident between her and Mr Astill on the day of her father&#8217;s fall. The context was a statement that &#8216;I don&#8217;t respect Mark and I don&#8217;t like Mark&#8217; (paragraph 101).

The letter further noted that she had started the external course, but had not been able to complete it on two previous occasions, and that she could not remember the name of the course. Mr Young did not think, either, that she was giving a definite date for finishing the course, or saying that she was sure she would be able to report to Mr Astill once she had done it. The letter explained why Mr Young thought that she was not yet prepared to report to Mr Astill. His reasons included her conduct since the warning. He acknowledged that she had not been present for much of that time &#8216;through personal issues&#8217;. The ET took that to be an acknowledgement that he knew that she had been helping her father, even though she had not said so at the meeting.

The letter as a whole was clear that while performance issues were taken into account, the &#8216;main issue, according to Mr Young, was&#8217; her refusal to accept what he said were the reporting structures established in 2016; that is that, rather than reporting to Mr Young directly, she should report to the payroll manager.</span></p>

He then asked Mr Taylor to make some further inquiries. In paragraph 118, the ET found that the appeal outcome letter contained his genuine opinions. He approached the appeal with an open mind and considered whether it was appropriate to reinstate Ms Sandhu. His view was that Ms Sandhu &#8216;showed no indication that [she] would accept reporting to a payroll manager without continuing issues and poor performance&#8217;. He was not convinced that she could work harmoniously in the existing structure. That would only cause &#8216;further unrest and turmoil&#8217; for her and for the Respondent. He considered that the performance issues she raised at the appeal were caused not only by her &#8216;unwillingness to accept the reporting line&#8217; but also by her poor communication, leadership and time management.

Its various findings of fact (see above) about the beliefs of Mr Taylor and Mr Bateh at various times were part of its inquiry into the reason or reasons for dismissal, as the language of paragraphs 123-125 shows. The ET concentrated on capability and &#8216;some other substantial reason&#8217;, which it abbreviated to &#8216;SOSR&#8217; (&#8216;while not ignoring the full text&#8217;) (paragraph 127).

At the first stage, &#8216;it would not be sufficient for [Ms Sandhu] simply to prove that what she alleges happened, did, in fact, happen. There has to be some evidential basis upon which [the ET] could reasonably infer that the proven facts did amount to a contravention. That being said, [the ET] can look at all the relevant facts and circumstances and make reasonable inferences where appropriate&#8217; (paragraph 141.1).

The numbering of the paragraphs resumes at paragraph 143 after paragraphs &#8216;43&#8217;-&#8216;48&#8217;. The ET referred to the effect described in section 26(1)(b)(i)-(iii) as &#8216;the prohibited effect&#8217;, adding that it had not ignored &#8216;that either purpose or effect is sufficient (it does not have to be both)&#8217; (paragraph 145). A claimant has to prove on the balance of probabilities that the conduct was unwanted and that it had the prohibited effect. That is not enough, as &#8216;the unwanted conduct also has to relate to disability&#8217;. The effect of section 136 is that the claimant did not need to prove on the balance of probabilities that the conduct was related to disability in order to shift the burden of proof. &#8216;We would need to be persuaded that there are proven facts from which we might infer that the conduct should be so related&#8217; (paragraph 147).</span></p>

In paragraph 150, the EAT said that it &#8216;must not cheapen the effects of the words in section 26(1)(b), and the mere fact alone that a claimant was, to some extent, upset by what was said or done is not necessarily enough to meet the definition&#8217;.

Mr Taylor sent the 29 January 2018 letter after he knew about the diagnosis and after Ms Sandhu had started to give him help. But &#8216;the letter was not sent for a sham reason&#8217;, for the reasons given in paragraph 157. There was a meeting and, then, an outcome letter. Nevertheless, &#8216;There are no facts from which we might conclude that he would have reached a different decision than to send his 29 January letter if [Ms Sandhu&#8217;s] father was not disabled&#8217; (paragraph 159). There had been no discussion of Ms Sandhu&#8217;s father&#8217;s illness or about her taking time off at the 6 February meeting. Instead, she had raised old matters, &#8216;including suggesting that Mr Astill was potentially to blame for delays and confusion&#8217; (paragraph 160). The warning was consistent with the Respondent&#8217;s policies. The letter of 8 February represented Mr Young&#8217;s genuine opinions. He believed that she was performing badly and that a verbal warning was appropriate (paragraph 162).</span></p>

There could have been a misunderstanding, or Mr Astill disliked Ms Sandhu and &#8216;seized on an opportunity to report her&#8217;, or, knowing that she had received a warning for poor performance, he saw it as his duty to report her. In any event, Mr Astill did not know that her father had cancer, and that did not motivate him to report her to Mr Young (paragraph 171). The report to Mr Young was unwanted conduct. The ET said that, in &#8216;a &#8220;but-for&#8221; sense, there was some connection between [Ms Sandhu&#8217;s] father&#8217;s disability, in that, but for her attending to her father, she would have been at work&#8230;&#8217; and but for that, Mr Astill would not have reported her to Mr Young. &#8216;However, even assuming, for the sake of discussion that this was sufficient to justify a decision that the conduct was related to [Ms Sandhu&#8217;s] father&#8217;s disability, we do not think it would be reasonable for the conduct to be treated as&#8217; having the proscribed effect. &#8216;The matter was reported to Mr Young, but there was no action taken by him&#8217;. She could, if she had chosen to, have explained the circumstances to him. &#8216;It would be cheapening the meaning of the words in section 26 to treat the factually accurate report of Mr Astill to Mr Young as amounting to harassment&#8217;.</span></p>

The principal reason for the dismissal was that she was not willing to change and to work with a Payroll Manager or adapt to new processes. &#8216;There was a close connection between the latter, and the performance process which had been ongoing&#8217;. Some of the evidence for the latter was that, in the Respondent&#8217;s view, she had failed to adopt changes which, in her performance reviews, and in the 6 February meeting, she had clearly been told to adopt (paragraph 195).</span></p>

All I would say is that, whatever the position may be when the allegation of harassment relates to the disability of the person who alleges that she has been harassed, I find it very difficult to see, how, in a case in which the allegation is based on the disability of a third person, an act can be said to be &#8216;related&#8217; to the disability of that third person if the person who is alleged to have harassed the claimant does not know about the disability of that third person.

With the exception of the Johal and the Astill incidents, the ET expressly found, therefore, that none the allegations of harassment, individually, or collectively, shifted the burden of proof to the Respondent. The reason why the ET held that the burden of proof did not shift is also significant.  It did not shift because there were no facts, in short, from which the ET could infer that the impugned conduct related to the disability of Ms Sandhu&#8217;s father.

I consider that the ET&#8217;s findings and conclusions about the Astill incident and the Johal incidents are clear. The ET held, in short, that neither incident could satisfy the statutory definition of harassment. As Mr Perry rightly accepted in the course of the argument, answering a question from Nugee LJ, whether that definition is met is quintessentially an evaluative assessment for the ET. As a matter of objective fact, as the ET expressly found, neither Ms Johal nor Mr Astill knew about Ms Sandhu&#8217;s father&#8217;s disability. As the ET acknowledged in paragraph 178 (see paragraph 67, above) matters might have been quite different if the ET had found that Ms Johal did know about Ms Sandhu&#8217;s father&#8217;s disability. That contextual factor, added to the utterly trivial nature of both incidents, plainly entitled the ET to conclude that neither incident could be, or was, an incident of harassment. The inference phrase was not, therefore, necessary in relation to either incident. On different facts, of course, two apparently trivial incidents might, when taken together, amount to harassment. But the position in this case was different, because the trivial conduct was conduct by two different people, neither of whom knew about the disability. The ET&#8217;s reasoning about &#8216;but-for&#8217; causation, far from indicating the conduct might be &#8216;related&#8217; to disability, serves, in my judgment, to emphasise the very tenuous and abstract nature of any link between the conduct of Ms Johal and Mr Astill and that disability. It is also unnecessary to the ET&#8217;s conclusions, and, indeed, if it suggests that the burden of proof could shift in relation to either incident, inconsistent with the reasons why the ET held that it did not shift in relation to other incidents. I would dismiss ground 1.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in;text-indent:0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The ET&#8217;s approach to the unfair dismissal claim was equally careful and nuanced. It must be taken to have been aware of the issues in the list of issues. Two related points are material to the ET&#8217;s analysis. None of the issues in that list was directed to the primary reason for dismissal, as the ET found it to be. The change of emphasis in the Respondent&#8217;s case meant that the issues which emerged at the hearing were not accurately identified in the list of issues. Second, a dismissal for not unreservedly accepting Mr Astill&#8217;s role - at any stage of the employer&#8217;s procedure, or of the ET hearing - raises different substantive and procedural questions from a dismissal for capability. I therefore reject Mr Perry&#8217;s bald submission that the issues on which he relied were, in the light of the actual reason for dismissal, as significant to the fairness of the dismissal as they would have been in a capability case.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in;text-indent:0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The ET&#8217;s meticulous analysis of the fairness of the dismissal focussed on six broad themes (see paragraphs 71-80, above). Those themes identified the areas which, in its expert judgment, really mattered to the fairness of the dismissal, on its careful findings of fact. The most significant finding for this purpose was that the primary reason for the dismissal was some other substantial reason (and not capability). It is true that the ET did not mechanically tick off all the issues in the (now inapposite) list of issues. I do not, however, accept that the ET erred in law, or failed to explain its conclusions adequately, because it did explain them sufficiently.  In my judgment, objectively, Ms Sandhu does know why she lost her claim for unfair dismissal. The ET was not required, in addition, to spell out that the issues in the list of issues were no longer central to the fairness of the dismissal. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in;text-indent:0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In any event, as Nugee LJ pointed out in the course of the argument, there is a significant overlap between the issues in the list of issues and those themes. The question whether Ms Sandhu had been warned that she could be dismissed if she did not accept Mr Astill&#8217;s role is linked with the question of incremental sanctions, the question of incremental sanctions is linked with the question whether dismissal (or a lesser sanction) was an appropriate, and all are linked to the question whether dismissal fell within the band of reasonable responses on these facts. I consider that the ET&#8217;s reasons were amply sufficient. I would therefore dismiss ground 2.</span></p>

I mean no discourtesy to HHJ Tayler by not referring to his judgment in the EAT. This was an appeal which wholly turned on the findings and analysis of the ET. I need say no more than that the EAT was right to dismiss Ms Sandhu&#8217;s appeal for the reasons which it gave.</span></p>
