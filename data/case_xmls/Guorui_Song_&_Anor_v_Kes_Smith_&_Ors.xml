	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The petitioners, Mr Song and Mrs Zhao, are husband and wife, as are the first and second respondents, Mr and Mrs Smith.  They are the directors and own the shares between them equally in the third respondent (the Company) which was incorporated on 31 August 2020. The Company in turn owns all the shares in five other companies, including SGR Estates Limited (SGR) and Kestral Construction Limited (KCL). The business of these companies involved the acquisition of properties in Cardiff, Newport and Barry, and the conversion of them into residential flats. The relationship between Mr Song and Mr Smith became very close but in July 2022 they fell out and neither wanted to work with the other again, and did not do so.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The petitioners now accuse Mr Smith of fraud and/or breach of his duties as director, by wrongly making cash withdrawals, unexplained transfers payments and purchases, excessive salary and mileage payments, employing family members and working on his own projects. Further, it is alleged that after the break up, Mr and Mrs Smith fraudulently and/or in breach of fiduciary duty or of a joint venture agreement, diverted business from SGR or KCL to themselves through companies which they then set up, including the fourth and fifth respondents (referred to by their initials). The petitioners claim that all of this has unfairly prejudiced their position as shareholders in the Company within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46/section/994" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 994</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Companies Act 2006</ref>, and seek remedies accordingly. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr and Mrs Smith deny any unfair prejudice. They say difficulties were caused when, in the summer of 2022, Mr Song stopped funding the business as he had been doing, withdrew sums standing to the credit of his directors loan account in order to buy an expensive home in London, and had nothing further to do with the Company or its business despite requests from Mr Smith. On top of this, the construction industry had been hit hard by rising prices and scarcity of labour and materials. They say that they did what they could to complete the three projects which were ongoing. They accepted that they then took on further similar projects through various companies, but say that they were entitled to do that because the men no longer wanted to work with one another because of Mr Song&#8217;s disengagement, and the insolvency at that time of KCL. They say their shareholding has been unfairly prejudiced by this and related conduct by Mr </p>

Many factual issues were explored in evidence, not all of which were pleaded or which need to be resolved in order to determine the parties&#8217; respective claims. I deal only with those that are pleaded or assist me in determining those claims. I have, however, considered all the points made in evidence and submissions, including those not referred to here. Before I turn to the issues, I will set out the background in a way which I hope is relatively uncontentious. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The petitioners are from China and retain business interests there. They are now resident in the UK. Their first language is Mandarin. They have property interests in Cardiff. Mr Smith left school at 16 and has always worked in the construction industry. In 2013 KCL was incorporated with Mr Smith&#8217;s mother Fatima Omar, as sole director.  It is not in dispute that he is a hard worker, often working six or seven days a week. The men were first introduced in 2016 when Mr Song was looking for a builder to convert a building in Cardiff into residential flats. At this time he was a director of a company called Muluhome Limited which carried on the business of estate agents. He engaged KCL to undertake that project which was successfully completed in 2017. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">At about that time, Mr Song incorporated SGR to take on similar projects of converting buildings into flats. He lent money to that company to purchase property and then borrowed money, secured on his personal assets, to cover the conversion costs. The first project of SGR followed shortly afterwards, again by instructing KCL. By the autumn of 2017, the trust between Mr Song and Mr Smith had grown to the extent that Mr Smith successfully negotiated the purchase of a property in Barry called Provincial House. He also negotiated with Hafod Housing Association (Hafod) to apply for planning permission for conversion into social housing. It was agreed that if granted Hafod would purchase the property and engage SGR to carry out the conversion works with KCL as subcontractor. Mr Smith had for some time built up experience of dealing with social housing development projects. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr and Mrs Smith were at this time looking for a home to buy and found one, after looking at several, at 10 Cyncoed Road. They were unable and/or unwilling to secure a mortgage. It was agreed that Mr Song would purchase the property by providing a substantial deposit and take out an interest only mortgage, the repayments for which would be reimbursed by Mr and Mrs Smith. The purchase was completed in October 2018. In December 2018 a declaration of trust was drawn up by which Mr Song acknowledged that he held the property on trust for Mr Smith absolutely. The copy of that document in the trial bundle appears to be signed by Mr Song, which he accepts is his signature, but there remain issues as to what he signed and as to the circumstances of any such signing. At around the same time Mr Song made Mr Smith a director of SGR. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In March 2019 SGR purchased property in Cathedral Road and engaged KCL to carry out works to convert it into 17 flats for sale to private purchasers. This was the only such project of SGR and KCL. Further projects were entered into on the model of Provincial House, namely purchase of property by SGR to sell to housing associations and conversion into social housing flats by KCL. In this model, the contract with the housing association provided for monthly payments to KCL or SGR upon application as the conversion works progressed. Two properties in Park Road, Cardiff were purchased later in 2019 on this model. </p>

It was Mr Smith who organised all of the construction work. One was a property in Stow Hill, Newport sold to Newport City Homes (Newport CH) and works of conversion to social housing subcontracted to KCL for &#163;4.2 million. Another was a property called Bay Chambers in Cardiff Bay, which was sold to Cadwyn Housing Association (Cadwyn) to convert to 44 flats. It was about this time that the first lockdown because of the Covid pandemic came into force in Wales. Later, a third project was at Holton Road in Barry, which was sold to Hafod.  </p>

This project, against expectation, was not significantly profitable, but the proceeds of sale allowed Mr Song to be repaid some of the loans which he had been putting into SGR in order to fund the projects. However, from May 2021 to July 2022 KCL experienced cash flow problems and during that period SGR made about two dozen payments of several thousand pounds each to KCL, totalling about &#163;114,000.

In an email that month Mr Song referred to the fact that he was buying a home in London and that there was &#8220;a little problem.&#8221; He asked Mr Smith to borrow money from his mother, Mrs Omar, to fund the projects, and she did lend some &#163;200,000.

He accepted that he has undertaken two degrees in the medium of English but said that these were scientific degrees which were concerned with calculations. Mr Smith is dyslexic and gave his evidence with assistance on the documentation. Their respective wives gave evidence, but only to a limited extent. Diane White was called to give evidence on behalf of the respondents. She has long experience firstly in banking and then as a commercial finance broker and then spent a year as a property development executive with the Development Bank for Wales. She came to know Mr Smith when she was a broker, and he persuaded her to work for SGR and KCL in 2018, and she still carries out work for him on a part time basis. In 2019, she approached Phillip Williams, then a tax partner with Gerald Thomas Accountants to help with the restructuring which later took place. He too was called as a witness by the respondents.

Mr Smith in his oral evidence said that the reason for that is that there were often oral communications including by telephone. In my judgment, from the text messages, it appears that the relationship between Mr Smith and Mr Song was relaxed and that was no doubt due, in part at least, to the trust which undisputedly then existed between these men. </p>

Mr Song accepted in his oral evidence that from this time he no longer wished to work with Mr Smith. At that time, three projects needed to be completed, namely Stow Hill (for Newport CH), Bay Chambers (for Cadwyn) and Haydock House (for Hafod). The Lloyds Bank accounts for SGR in respect of the first two of these, and for KCL in respect of the third, show monthly receipts from the housing associations of five figure sums over the following 18 months to 2 years, totalling around &#163;2 million, &#163;1million and &#163;2 million respectively.  </p>

She dealt with buying, administration, plant hire, warranties and consultants. In my judgment their evidence on this is consistent with the monthly payments being made by the housing associations, and I accept it.

He said that the costs of this project exceeded expectations without explanation. He did not accept that the lockdowns had any impact. It was put to Mr and Mrs Smith in cross-examination, and by way of closing submissions, that there was no such impact, to which they each reacted with some incredulity at such a suggestion. They each referred to significant rises. Mr Smith said, for example that the day work rate for carpenters almost doubled. Mrs Smith gave more detail, saying that materials generally went up by 24% in 2021 and some, such as insulation went up by some 60% and were unavailable. The costs of some projects went up by 70%. This trend continued into 2022.

It is also admitted that Mr Song had control over the SGR Barclays Bank account and asserted this was part of the joint venture agreement or accepted by Mr Smith by conduct. It is also asserted that under that agreement, Mr Song had discretion whether or not to invest funds. The remainder of the allegations in the counterclaim as to unfair prejudice are denied. </p>

There is nothing in writing to confirm this, even though the parties had accountants and solicitors acting in the restructuring. Such an open-ended commitment would be very onerous to Mr Song, and it may have been expected that if given this would have been recorded in writing.  It would be surprising if such a commitment were given on an unconditional basis, so that whatever </p>

Although reference is made in the contemporary documents to the withdrawal of monies without consent, the language used by Mr Smith at the time does not clearly demonstrate that this was regarded as a breach of the joint venture agreement. In my judgment it is unlikely that such a term arose, either expressly, or even less likely, implicitly. </p>

They both accepted in oral evidence that in July 2022 they reached the position that neither wanted to work with the other again, and there is some indication of that in the contemporaneous documentation. In my judgment the appropriate analysis is that the joint venture agreement was mutually determined in July by words and/or conduct of the men. Mr Song was entitled to refuse further funding. </p>

I accept his evidence that he was able do this with the turnover generating by the KCHR and KCAR contracts and by bank borrowing. As the joint venture agreement was at an end, in my judgment it was open to him to take on these contracts through these companies. It was not a diversion of SGR or KCL business as those companies were not in a position to take up such contracts as a result of the men not wanting to work with another again and/or because of the financial difficulties of those companies at the time. Nor was this a case of Mr Smith using knowledge, names, or any other assets of those companies in order to secure these contracts. Mr Smith, I accept, already had experience and knowledge relating to housing association contracts and was already using the name Kestral before the joint venture agreement and there is nothing to suggest that by words or conduct Mr Smith assigned this name for the exclusive use of the Company or KCL. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;But I think that parties ought to be encouraged, where at all possible, to avoid the expense of money and spirit inevitably involved in such litigation (See Shakespeare, Sonnet 129) by making an offer to purchase at an early stage. This was a somewhat unusual case in that Mr. Phillips, despite his revised views about Mr. O'Neill's competence, was willing to go on working with him. This is a position which the majority shareholder is entitled to take, even if only because he may consider it less unattractive than having to raise the capital to buy out the minority. Usually, however, the majority shareholder will want to put an end to the association. In such a case, it will almost always be unfair for the minority shareholder to be excluded without an offer to buy his shares or make some other fair arrangement. The Law Commission (Shareholder Remedies (Law Com. No. 246) (1997) (Cm. 3769), paras. 3.26&#8211;56) has recommended that in a private company limited by shares in which substantially all the members are directors, there should be a statutory presumption that the removal of a shareholder as a director, or from substantially all his functions as a director, is unfairly prejudicial conduct. This does not seem to me very different in practice from the present law. But the unfairness does not lie in exclusion alone but exclusion without a reasonable offer. If the respondent to a petition has plainly made a reasonable offer, then the exclusion as such will not be unfairly prejudicial and he will be entitled to have the petition struck out. It is therefore very important that participants in such companies should be able to know what counts as a reasonable offer.&#8221; </p>

Lord Hoffman went on to give guidance as to what constitutes a reasonable offer, namely one that was fair, reflective of expert opinion produced as the result of equality of arms, and taking into account costs. In this case, the offer was significantly more that the Companies&#8217; accountants then valued SGR and KCL. It was made within days of the breakdown, before any significant costs had been incurred. In my judgment it was a reasonable offer, and so if there was exclusion, it was not without a reasonable offer. </p>

Although Mr Smith did not have access to the SGR Barclays Bank account, he did not at the time complain about this and the contemporaneous documentation shows that he was able to participate in the management of SGR. The messages show that when Mr Song was asked for money, he gave it in a timely manner. Mr Smith admitted in cross-examination that if money was needed Mr Song generally would not refuse. In my judgment, the allegations of aggression, exploitation or misrepresentation of wealth are not made out. </p>

Mr Song was aware that he was holding the property for Mr Smith. As Mr Williams was acting for Mr Song as well as the companies, Mr Williams was concerned to ensure that Mr Song understood the position under the deed, otherwise he would advise him to obtain separate advice.
