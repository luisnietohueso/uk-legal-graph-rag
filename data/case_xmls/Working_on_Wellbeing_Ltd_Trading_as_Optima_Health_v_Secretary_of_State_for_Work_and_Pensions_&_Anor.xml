	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an appeal in a public procurement dispute. There are broadly three issues. The first is whether the Invitation to Tender (&#8220;ItT&#8221;) prepared by the respondents (whom I shall call &#8220;DWP&#8221;) contained a mandatory exclusion provision which meant that, if any of the tendered line items exceeded the existing Framework Maximum Prices, the whole tender would be excluded from consideration. The second is whether DWP were entitled or even obliged to seek clarification of the errors in the bid provided by the appellant (whom I shall call &#8220;Optima&#8221;), where those errors had no effect on the scoring and an impact of just 0.02% on the evaluation of the price. The third raises questions of detail about requests for clarification during a tender process, and in particular the limits on what a tenderer can permissibly do when answering such a request.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These issues matter very much on the facts of this case because, if the tender provided by Optima had not been excluded from consideration then, as DWP well knew, it would have been comfortably the winning bid, because it was by far the highest-scoring on quality. It also matters because the power/duty to seek clarification is an issue which is the subject of some high level statements of principle in the European cases, but rather less practical guidance for contracting authorities and economic operators.</p>

In those circumstances, I am conscious that, since I take a different view to the judge on a number of the critical issues, I should explain the reasons for my conclusions with particular clarity. </p>

Under Schedule 7 of that Framework Agreement, DWP could award call-off contracts either via a direct award or a further competition. The Framework Agreement included a schedule setting out the maximum prices that Optima (and the other service providers who signed up to the Framework Agreement) could charge for each individual service item in any call-off contract that might be awarded under the Framework. Those were called the &#8220;Framework Maximum Prices&#8221;. They are described in paragraph 1.1.1. of Framework Schedule 3 as &#8220;the basis of the charges (and are maximums that the Supplier may charge) under each call-off contract&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I address particular parts of the ItT when dealing with Issue 1/Ground 1 of this appeal, in Section 5.1 below. At present it is sufficient to say that there were a number of parts of the ItT which explained in clear terms that no unit price in the Pricing Schedule was to exceed the Framework Maximum Prices.  Paragraph 2.2 of Attachment 1 said that &#8220;any bids for any service line submitted to the Framework by invited bidders in excess of this [the Framework Maximum Prices] will be discounted.&#8221; Moreover, this was always understood and agreed by Optima: in answer to questionnaire 1, they had stated that they &#8220;agree, without caveats, or limitations, that in the event we are successful, the terms and conditions [of the RM6182 Framework Agreement] will govern the provision of this contract&#8221;. That therefore included the Framework Maximum Prices.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The procurement exercise was very prolonged. There were numerous exchanges between the bidders and DWP and a whole series of revised pricing schedules for the bidders to complete. The detail of those different pricing schedules, and the bidders&#8217; responses, are set out in detail by the judge at [23]-[48] of the judgment, which I gratefully adopt and do not repeat. However, other than noting the lack of clarity evidenced by the various documents produced by DWP, and the fact that, by the time the eventual evaluation took place in May 2023, almost a year had passed, so that there was a natural desire for urgency on their part, I consider that the unhappy history of the procurement is of peripheral relevance to the issues under appeal. </p>

	      </authorialNote>  It was discovered that Optima had exceeded their Framework Maximum Prices in relation to 3 (out of the total of 133) service delivery lines. It appears from the evidence that DWP always knew that there was &#8220;a potential high possibility&#8221; of a bidder missing an item in their Pricing Schedule which was not in line with the Framework: see [31] of the judgment below, citing an internal DWP email of 10 January 2023.

In the Revised Pricing Schedule, the item was changed from &#8216;per check&#8217; to &#8216;face to face&#8217;, without that change being advertised. The change was not spotted by Optima, so the price of &#163;105 was retained, even though that was now above the applicable Framework Maximum Price of &#163;40<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span> </span>The irony is that, in respect of this particular item, it was the Framework Maximum Prices that were the wrong way round. They had been incorrectly transposed, so that there was a higher figure for telephone checks than for face-to-face checks.<span> </span></p>
	      </authorialNote>. The volume for OH58 was said to be &#8216;0&#8217;, which meant that the erroneous figure did not form part of the evaluation and was not therefore an element of the scores awarded to the bidders.</p>

The figures quoted by Optima were its Framework Maximum Prices for a face-to-face service, but were more than their Framework Maximum Prices for a telephone service.</p>

In respect of OH229, where the volumes were indicated as 10 and the figure quoted was &#163;60 above the Framework Maximum Price, the overall effect on the price was therefore &#163;600. DWP calculated at the time of the evaluation that this was the equivalent of 0.02% of the overall price. DWP also noted contemporaneously that this made no difference whatever to the overall score. This was a very low indicative volume: some items were shown with an indicative volume as high as 95,000.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It transpired that, in relation to the other four bidders, one had withdrawn, another had been excluded, and a third had also submitted prices in excess of its Framework Maximum Prices. The remaining bidder, People Asset Management Limited (&#8220;PAM&#8221;), had produced a compliant bid. Following the exclusion of Optima, PAM were awarded the contract. The circumstances in which the appellant came to be excluded from the competition are dealt with in detail under Issue 2, in Section 6 of this judgment below. As the judge noted at [59], PAM had been given a quality score of 74.38 and a total weighted quality score of 52.06. Optima&#8217;s quality score was 95 and its total weighted quality score was 66.50. Thus, if Optima had not been excluded from the competition by reason of clerical errors worth &#163;600, they would have been awarded the call-off contract, because theirs was comfortably the best bid. As will become apparent below, that is one of the elements of this procurement dispute which, in my view, make it notable.</p>

They took a variety of points but they essentially now boil down to the three noted at the outset of this judgment. First they say that there was no clear warning in the ItT that, if the prices exceeded the Framework Maximum Prices for any line item, the whole tender would be excluded. Secondly, they say that DWP failed to exercise its discretion, properly or at all, when considering whether or not to seek clarification, because i) they erroneously concluded that there was a mandatory exclusion provision in the ItT; ii) they failed to give proper consideration to their options;  and iii) they wrongly believed that any request for clarification would breach the requirement for equal treatment. Thirdly, they say that, not only is it common for contracting authorities to seek clarification in circumstances where there are obvious errors in a pricing schedule, but the particular circumstances meant that DWP had an obligation to seek such clarification here.</p>

He said that the consequences of disqualification were spelt out by the terms of the ItT &#8220;and in particular at 6.9.2&#8221; [139]. He noted in the same paragraph that &#8220;there was a constancy about the requirement that the prices must not be exceeded.&#8221; He rejected the argument that there was an ambiguity because the word &#8220;discounted&#8221; had been used in paragraph 2.2 of attachment 1 of the ItT but he went on to say at [142] even if there was a potential ambiguity about the meaning of that word, &#8220;there was, on looking at the process as a whole, no ambiguity&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ground 1 of the appeal is a challenge to the judge&#8217;s conclusion that the ItT made it plain that a bid would be excluded if the Framework Maximum Prices were exceeded. This was largely, but not exclusively, an issue concerned with paragraph 2.2 of Attachment 1 of the ItT (a point affirmed by the judge at [208], first sentence), and reflected the first Preliminary Issue before the judge. I have called that Issue 1/Ground 1. Again, however, it was unclear how the Grounds of Appeal related one to another, just as it had been unclear how the original Preliminary Issues were intended to fit together. So the court was obliged to ask both counsel what the consequences would be if Optima failed on Issue 1/Ground 1. On behalf of DWP, Mr Suterwalla originally said that, if DWP was right on Issue 1/Ground 1, then that was the end of the appeal: Optima had been lawfully excluded by reference to a mandatory exclusion provision. That had also been the thrust of his skeleton argument. However, on the morning of the second day of the appeal, he handed up a note which suggested that, even if he was right on Issue 1/Ground 1, DWP may still have had a residual discretion not to exclude. On behalf of Optima, Ms Sloane KC said that, even if there was a mandatory exclusion provision, there was still an opportunity for DWP to waive that provision, so on her case, defeat for Optima on Issue 1/Ground 1 was not the end of the appeal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This lack of clarity as to the effect of Issue 1/Ground 1 is not, I think, an empty complaint. Amongst other things, the result &#8211; that there was a mandatory exclusion provision &#8211; has bled into other issues. It has also led to an elision in the arguments (still discernible on appeal) between the principles concerned with seeking clarification of obvious errors or ambiguities (on the one hand), and the principles relevant to waiving a requirement in an ItT (on the other). Those principles are very different and, in my judgment, the confusion between them has led to errors both below, and in the presentation of the respective cases on appeal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is also necessary to identify the other Grounds of Appeal and address them in a proper sequence. On analysis, Ground 5 (which seeks to take issue with the relevance of the judge&#8217;s finding of fault on the part of Optima as to how the errors came about) was a part of Optima&#8217;s alternative case that, even if they lost on Issue 1/Ground 1, they had an alternative way round the mandatory exclusion clause by alleging waiver. It therefore follows that Ground 5 only arises directly if Optima are unsuccessful on Issue 1/Ground 1. To the extent that the issue of fault is relevant to proportionality, I address it under Ground 4.</p>

If DWP wrongly failed to consider the options other than exclusion, they unlawfully fettered their own discretion. I have called that Issue 2/Ground 6.</p>

Ground 2 is concerned with the first stage in the analysis: whether there was an obvious error or ambiguity in the tender. Ground 3 is concerned with the second and third stages, namely whether clarification request should have been sought and, if so, whether it would have been impermissible for the bid to have been changed or, as Mr Suterwalla kept putting it, for Optima &#8220;to have a second bite of the cherry&#8221;.

Additionally, these &#8220;cut and paste&#8221; errors were in respect of exceptionally minor pricing items amongst almost 200 correct items. As noted above, it is these aspects of the appeal that are likely to be of wider interest to the public procurement community.</p>

Although disputes as to the meaning of a provision in the ItT are, in one sense, a matter of construction, the issue is not what the ItT meant, but whether its meaning would be clear to any RWIND tenderer: see [27] of <span style="font-style:italic">Healthcare at Home</span>. Lord Reed there made clear that, whilst evidence may be necessary a) to enable the court to put itself into the position of the RWIND tenderer (such as evidence about technical terms), and b) about the context in which the document has to be construed, the question could not be determined by such evidence, because it depended on the application of a legal test.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am in no doubt that, when read in its context, paragraph 2.2 of Attachment 1 of the ItT (paragraph 29 above) did not contain a mandatory exclusion provision, and that no RWIND tenderer would have come to any such conclusion. </p>

	  <num>37.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first reason for that conclusion is because it is not what the paragraph says. There is no reference to exclusion or disqualification. If that had been the intention of the ItT at paragraph 2.2, then it would have been perfectly easy to make that plain. After all, the provisions noted in paragraphs 30 and 31 above, taken from other parts of the ItT, expressly warn about the possibility of exclusion on the happening of particular acts or omissions. There is no such reference in paragraph 2.2. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, the key word in paragraph 2.2 is &#8220;discounted&#8221;. It is, I think, common ground that that can have one of two very different meanings. It can mean discounted as in &#8220;reduced&#8221;, and it can mean discounted as in &#8220;excluded&#8221; or &#8220;disqualified&#8221;. But here, not only are the words &#8220;excluded&#8221; and &#8220;disqualified&#8221; used elsewhere in the ItT (which points away from that interpretation of &#8220;discounted&#8221;), but also &#8220;discounts&#8221; (meaning &#8220;reductions&#8221;) were expressly provided for: see paragraph 32 above. In other words, in the context of the ItT as a whole, the obvious meaning of &#8220;discounted&#8221; was &#8220;reduced&#8221;, not &#8220;excluded&#8221; or &#8220;disqualified&#8221;. I note that, in their internal document of 3 May 2023, in which they seek to justify the exclusion of Optima (paragraph 97b) below), that is precisely how DWP themselves use the word &#8220;discounted&#8221;.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_39">
	  <num>39.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, what is it that is being discounted? It is a bid &#8220;for any service line&#8221; in excess of the Framework Maximum Price. In this way, the discounting is expressly limited to the tainted service line(s). Two points flow from that. It provides further support for the proposition that &#8220;discounted&#8221; means &#8220;reduced&#8221;. It also demonstrates that the discounting is expressly <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> extended to the whole bid. On this basis, the only item that is discounted is a bid for any service line where the figure is more than the Framework Maximum Price, and the obvious discount, or reduction, is down to the Framework Maximum Price. The words in paragraph 2.2 are completely contrary to any suggestion that a bid on a service line in excess of the Framework Maximum Price would lead to the exclusion or disqualification of the entire bid.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_40">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There would appear to be no answer to these specific points, particularly that last one. Indeed, I note that at paragraph 39(a) of his skeleton argument, Mr Suterwalla made no attempt to do so. Instead he sought to advance the interpretation argument as if the relevant words were just &#8220;any bids&#8221; rather than the actual words used, which were &#8220;any bids <span style="font-style:italic">for any service line</span>&#8221;. He did the same in his oral submissions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept of course that there are other parts of the ItT which suggest that exclusion of a non-compliant bid is a possibility, and that bidding in excess of the Framework Maximum Price is, on one view, a non-compliance: see by way of example paragraph 6.9.2, set out in paragraph 30 above. But those provisions give rise to a discretion on the part of DWP: they provide no answer to Ground 1/Issue 1, which is solely concerned with whether or not paragraph 2.2 of Attachment 1 is a <span style="font-style:italic">mandatory</span> exclusion provision.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_42">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, it is right to note that, at the very least, the words of paragraph 2.2 are wholly incapable of providing the clarity and transparency required of any exclusion provision, as reiterated in the three authorities set out at paragraphs 33-35 above. In their contemporaneous document of 3 May 2022, on which DWP themselves rely for other purposes, they refer to the words in paragraph 2.2 as &#8220;giving rise to some ambiguity which may be open to interpretation&#8221;. On that basis alone, the paragraph cannot in law be construed as a mandatory exclusion provision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I consider that the judge&#8217;s approach to Issue 1/Ground 1 was erroneous. First, he did not anywhere address paragraph 2.2 as a whole, or contrast it with those parts of the ItT which expressly provided for exclusion or disqualification. Secondly, he failed to address my third reason, noted in paragraph 39 above, as to why it could only have been the offending service line which was &#8220;discounted&#8221;, not the whole bid, and how that supported Optima&#8217;s construction of the paragraph. Those specific points are not addressed in the judge&#8217;s analysis at [132]-[148]. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, perhaps because of the muddle over which arguments fitted where, the judge&#8217;s analysis of this issue ran together two different things. At [134] and following, he emphasised that the ItT made plain that the individual line items were not to exceed the Framework Maximum Prices. That is true. But that is a different point to the existence of a mandatory exclusion clause to the effect that, if the bidder did exceed the Framework Maximum Prices, even in one immaterial instance, their whole tender would be automatically excluded. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourthly, I consider that he was wrong to say that, in some way, paragraph 6.9.2 of Attachment 1 (to which he refers at [135] and [139]), somehow provided the necessary clear warning that the tender would be excluded if the price of a line item was more than the Framework Maximum Price. That paragraph is inconsistent with paragraph 2.2, so it can hardly have the necessary clarity. But in any event, paragraph 6.9.2 simply reserved a right on the part of DWP to exclude a non-compliant bid. In exercising that right, DWP had to exercise their discretion in accordance with their duties of equality and transparency, and with an eye on the purposes of public procurement generally, explained in greater detail below. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judge&#8217;s reliance on paragraph 6.9.2 suggests that he perhaps misunderstood Optima&#8217;s case on Issue 1/Ground 1. Optima does not suggest (and have never suggested) that their errors did not potentially trigger a discretion on the part of the respondents to consider whether those three line items should simply be discounted down to the Framework Maximum Prices, or be the subject of a request for clarification. They say that the discretion was not exercised properly or at all, but that is a different argument. On Issue 1/Ground 1, Optima has always maintained the position that there was no mandatory exclusion. The judge&#8217;s rejection of that argument, such as at [142], appears to expressly acknowledge that bids <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> be excluded, not that they would or must be, and therefore undermines his own conclusion on this first issue.</p>

His attempt to diminish the importance of this by suggesting that a RWIND tenderer would not have had any difficulty in understanding the paragraph is unpersuasive: if the contracting authority who prepared the ItT thought it was open to interpretation, why would the economic operator have reached the opposite view?</p>

As to the first point, I consider that the judge did err in principle for the various reasons that I have already outlined in paragraphs 43-48 above. As to the second point, there are no factual findings in any of the relevant parts of his judgment concerned with the mandatory exclusion clause. There were no technical terms that required to be explained. The judge considered the words used, rather than any wider evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For these reasons, I would allow Ground 1 of the appeal. In my judgment, a RWIND tenderer would have read paragraph 2.2 as saying that, if the quoted price for any line item was in excess of the Framework Maximum Prices, it would be discounted (reduced) to that maximum price. On that basis, DWP failed to follow their own ItT. If that is wrong then, at the very least, DWP should have sought clarification. These conclusions make it unnecessary for this court to consider separately Ground 5 of the appeal (concerned with the issue of fault) because that was primarily raised as part of an alternative argument by Optima that, if there was a mandatory exclusion clause, it was or should have been waived. Since there was no mandatory exclusion clause, the question of fault does not directly arise. To the extent that the parties made some submissions as to fault in connection with proportionality and rationality, I address them at Section 11 below, under Ground 4.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Notwithstanding my conclusion that the proper interpretation of paragraph 2.2 may provide a complete answer to the problems posed by this appeal (namely, that the three line items should have been reduced to the Framework Maximum Prices and the call-off contract awarded to Optima), it is important to go on and address the other issues. I do so on the alternative basis advanced by Mr Suterwalla: namely that paragraph 2.2 should be put to one side as being unclear, and that DWP had a discretion/duty to decide what to do about the non-compliant bid (and, in particular, whether to seek clarification). In doing that, I shall follow the outline set out in paragraphs 26-27 above. So in Section 6 below, I address briefly the law relating to a waiver of an ItT condition, because DWP rely on these cases in support of one of their later submissions. In Section 7, I set out the law concerning post-tender clarifications. In Section 8, I deal with Issue 2/Ground 6 of the appeal, which is to the effect that DWP wrongly fettered their discretion when deciding not to seek clarification. In Sections 9-11, I deal with Issue 3/Grounds 2, 3 and 4 of the appeal, primarily concerned with when a power to request a clarification becomes a duty, and the limits on what a tenderer can do when replying. There is a short summary of my conclusions in Section 12 below.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">JB Leadbitter &amp; Co Ltd v Devon County Council</span> [2009] EWHC 930 (Ch); [2010] Eu LR60 (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Leadbitter</span>&#8221;) there was a failure to provide all the written material by the deadline. David Richards J (as he then was) found that it was wrong to say that the tender contained an error: it was substantially incomplete by reason of the omission of certain case studies, as he explained at [44]. The judge rejected the contracting authority&#8217;s submission that the principle of proportionality did not apply to the implementation of the terms of the procurement process, but at [55]-[63] he concluded that its application depended on a number of limitations. These included that, since the exercise of discretionary powers necessarily involved judgment on the part of the contracting authority, the court would not intervene unless the decision was unjustifiable. That accorded with the proper meaning of a &#8220;manifest error&#8221; in this context.  </p>

All of the remaining arguments advanced in that case, such as an alleged duty to select contractors only on the basis of the most economically advantageous tenders, the duty to act proportionately, and so forth, all failed because the contracting authority had set out precisely what would happen if a tender was not delivered in complete form by the deadline, and any sort of waiver was impermissible.

This may be using different words to present Professor Arrowsmith&#8217;s views. In my judgment the correct approach is to characterise the failure, firstly, as one of either form or content. If form, then there is a second step. If the failure relates to content, in my judgment, the second step would not fall to be considered at all. That second step would be then to consider the scope and extent of the failure. If merely trivial, then the authority could potentially waive the failure, as long as doing so would not breach the obligations of transparency and equal treatment. Further, such waiver should only be permissible in the most exceptional of cases. It is also important to differentiate between cases where the rules of the competition entitle the authority to waive non-compliance, and those that do not. Those authorities engaged in competitions where the rules specifically do not permit this will rarely be entitled to act contrary to those rules, although of course the rules will differ in case to case.&#8221;</p>

As we shall see, the law relating to the seeking of clarification is not quite so onerous from a bidder&#8217;s perspective.

There was therefore nothing that needed to be waived. However, Mr Suterwalla developed an argument by reference to these authorities, which he said applied to the (different) duty/obligation on the part of a contracting authority to seek clarification of obvious errors and ambiguities.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the purposes of this appeal, I consider that the more important cases are those concerned with errors in the pricing of the bids. That is because those errors, if corrected, are more likely to lead to what could potentially be labelled a new bid, and that may be impermissible. Only three of the authorities are concerned with that situation. Moreover, the first (<span style="font-style:italic">Adia Interim SA v E.C. Commission </span>[1996] 3 CLMR 849 (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Adia</span>&#8221;)) is now 30 years old, and there has been a lot of water under the public procurement bridge since then. The other two (<span style="font-style:italic">Antwerpse Bouwwerken NV v European Commission </span>[2009] ECR II-4439 (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Antwerpse</span>&#8221;) and <span style="font-style:italic">Siemens Mobility Ltd </span>v<span style="font-style:italic"> High Speed 2 (HS2) Ltd </span>[2023] EWHC 2768 (TCC); [2024] 212, Con LR 136 (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Siemens</span>&#8221;) are more recent. Moreover, they are both cases where the contracting authority carefully sought clarification from the bidder, and awarded the contract to that bidder on the basis of the clarification provided. That would appear to confirm that seeking clarification and acting on the answers received is more common than once it was. The litigation in each of those cases concerned a challenge by the ultimately unsuccessful bidder to the original decision to seek clarification. Both challenges were unsuccessful.</p>

The tender contained an erroneous figure for the coefficient turning the gross hourly rate into the billing rate. The European Court rejected the submission that the contracting authority &#8211; in that case the Commission itself &#8211; should have itself corrected the error. The Court said that the systematic calculation error was not &#8220;particularly obvious&#8221; [46] and the selection committee could not determine &#8220;its exact nature or cause&#8221; [47]. It was not clear whether the error was a calculation error made in applying the formula presented by the applicant; an error in determining the coefficient; or simply a clerical error. The court went on to say in [47] that &#8220;in those circumstances, any contact made by the Commission with the applicant in order to seek out jointly with it the exact nature and cause of the systematic calculation error would have involved a risk that other factors taken into account in order to establish its tender price &#8211; in particular those relating to the calculation of the coefficient encompassing its profit margin &#8211; might have been adjusted, and this would have entailed, contrary to the applicant&#8217;s claims, an infringement of the principle of equal treatment to the detriment of the other tenderers&#8221;.</p>

This error arose because the contracting authority (again the EC Commission) had issued an addendum to the re-tendered dossier and had thus extended the procurement period, but Tideland had not altered the date for acceptance in consequence. The Commission rejected the tender because of that error. They argued that there was no ambiguity and that the strict rules of the tender competition should apply. At [25] of the court&#8217;s judgment, it was noted that the Commission argued that the tender contained a formal error &#8220;in respect of one of the basic tender conditions, which cannot be corrected.&#8221; That was as Ms Sloane correctly pointed out, very similar to the arguments run by DWP in the present case. </p>

The Court went on to hold that the principle of equality did not preclude the contracting authority from allowing tenderers to clarify any ambiguities in their tenders [38]. The Court had regard to the principle of proportionality [39], and noted that &#8220;where there is a choice between several appropriate measures recourse must be had to the least onerous.&#8221; In the circumstances, the principle of good administration and the principle of proportionality &#8220;required [the contracting authority] to resolve the resulting ambiguity by seeking clarification of the period for validity of the applicant&#8217;s tender&#8221; [42]. The ultimate conclusion at [43] was that the decision to reject the tender without seeking clarification of the intended period of validity was clearly disproportionate and thus vitiated by a manifest error of assessment. I should add for completeness that, whilst the principle of good administration does not apply in English law (see <span style="font-style:italic">Bechtel v HS2</span> [2021] EWHC 458 (TCC) at [297]), the alternative finding based on the principle of proportionality certainly does, as of course does the specific English concept of irrationality.</p>

It is after all in the public interest that a well-qualified and experienced provider of legal services in the field of immigration should be permitted to continue in business. However, any such duty is severely circumscribed where there is a competitive tender and an over-riding duty to treat all tenderers equally&#8230; Any general duty to give an applicant an opportunity to correct errors in the absence of fault by the defendant, yields to the duty to apply the rules of the competition consistently and fairly between all applicants, and not afford an individual applicant an opportunity to amend the bid and improve its prospects of success in the competition after the submission date had passed.&#8221;</p>

And even here, not every case of ambiguity or inability to proceed will require relief to be granted by the awarding authority: see the <span style="font-style:italic">Tideland </span>principle referred to in paragraph 27 above.

The contracting authority must then consider whether clarification should or must be sought. The authority has a discretion (&#8220;may&#8221; is the word used in Regulation 56(4)) and it can only ever be the factual circumstances of any given case that would turn that discretion into an obligation (see <span style="font-style:italic">Antwerpse </span>at [56] and [65] and <span style="font-style:italic">Harrow Solicitors</span> at [30](3)(b)). An obligation to seek clarification has been said to arise &#8220;where the terms of the tender itself and the surrounding circumstances known to [the contracting authority] indicate that the ambiguity probably has a simple explanation and is capable of being easily resolved&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Tideland </span>at [37])<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third stage is concerned with the limited room for manoeuvre that a tenderer has when answering any request for clarification. A tenderer cannot use the mechanism of clarification to put in a new bid (<span style="font-style:italic">SAG)</span> or make substantial amendments to the existing bid (<span style="font-style:italic">Archus)</span>. It is important to understand what is meant by these requirements, neither of which is to be applied on a literal or strict basis. The correction of an error will usually, if not inevitably, result in something which is in a strict or literal sense &#8220;new&#8221;, as the document contains something which was not there before. Moreover, as the authorities show,  a change worth several hundreds of thousands of pounds was not regarded as a substantial amendment or a new bid (<span style="font-style:italic">Siemens</span>) when, on an overly literal view, it was both.</p>

That approach is justified because, on the analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">Harrow Solicitors, </span>it might be said that the new information is not a change at all, because objectively the bid did not contain the relevant information in the first place. On the other hand, I think Mr Suterwalla is plainly right to say that the mechanism of clarification cannot be used to allow the tenderer to &#8216;have another go&#8217;: that would destroy the need for proper and fair discipline in the tender process.</p>

Common sense is therefore required when applying the rules to achieve those ends: experienced evaluators working for contracting authorities should know when a response to a request for clarification is a simple adjustment of the kind they generally expected, and when it is an attempt to have another go. The latter is a new bid or a substantial change to the original bid. What is to be avoided is a strict and over-literal approach which may lead to the exclusion of the best tender for no objectively justifiable reason (see <span style="font-style:italic">Antwerpse</span> at [65]).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I revert to some of these principles, and give further examples when addressing the issues in the appeal below. I note that, during the course of his oral submissions, Mr Suterwalla advanced a number of propositions which were based, in one way or another, on DWP&#8217;s belief &#8211; apparent throughout this dispute &#8211; in the centrality of the principle of equal treatment to the exclusion of all else, and how and why any request for clarification of the tender in this (or really in any other) case would have breached that principle and was therefore impermissible. I consider that each of his propositions was contrary to those from the authorities that I have summarised in the previous paragraphs, and I explain why in the relevant sections of the judgment below. These fundamental errors of principle explain how and why this procurement went wrong: how it was that DWP knowingly awarded the call-off contract to a significantly inferior bid because they considered, based on an erroneous understanding of the law, that there was a mandatory exclusion provision, and that their duty of equal treatment to PAM overrode their duty to the public, both in terms of ensuring a healthy and effective competition, and ensuring that the outcome of the competition was in the public interest. </p>

Third, there was, on the facts, no question of the rules relating to equal treatment being infringed.

That is not the language of a proper exercise of a discretion. It stems from DWP&#8217;s erroneous view that they had an automatic right to exclude if the Framework Maximum Prices were exceeded. It explains why DWP said in the letter of 22 June in express terms that &#8220;there was no discretion around disqualification if that requirement was breached&#8221;. The documents show that, whilst concerns about equal treatment were raised, they were never properly explored, because of the belief in the mandatory exclusion. </p>

However, in my view, on a proper analysis, that document is firmly against them. The very first paragraph, which talked of the &#8220;right to exclude non-compliant bidders&#8221; demonstrates that what it was recording was a justification for the exclusion of Optima, not a proper consideration of any less onerous options (as required by law). Furthermore, the four options are only said to arise as a means of comparison to &#8220;the above approach, i.e. excluding Optima&#8221;. In other words, it appears that a decision had already been taken to exclude Optima&#8217;s bid in the first half of the page. Of course, a large section of that part of the document is redacted as &#8220;privileged&#8221; which is particularly unfortunate given that it is in the redacted part that &#8220;the above approach, i.e. excluding Optima&#8221;, is apparently set out. But there is more than sufficient material to permit this court to conclude that this was all about exclusion, not an exercise of discretion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Another indication of DWP&#8217;s erroneous approach can be seen at the third bullet point, where they discuss the option of seeking clarification. That makes plain that DWP only thought that this was an option if every bidder had produced a non-compliant bid. Since that was not the case, this option was not considered further. That was wrong in law; as explained above, what matters is the nature of the errors made, and whether they were obvious and material. Clarification may have been required from more than one bidder, but only if those threshold conditions had been met. On the facts here, as explained below, any request for clarification would have been limited to Optima. In addition, this document undermines DWP&#8217;s case before the judge, and on appeal, that they gave careful thought to seeking clarification of the three line item errors; the document suggests that DWP looked at it the wrong way round, and once they knew there was a compliant bid, that was the end of the matter.</p>

Of course, I consider that there was, because that is how I have found a RWIND tenderer would or could have understood paragraph 2.2. But even putting that paragraph to one side, this objection does not add up. The ItT was anxious to emphasise that the Framework Maximum Prices should not be exceeded, so DWP may not have wanted to set out an express process as to what should happen if they were. But that is why paragraph 6.9.1 (second bullet) and Regulation 56(4) allowed DWP to seek clarification in respect of obvious errors and ambiguities which should not have happened but which (on DWP&#8217;s own evidence) were inevitable in an exercise of this kind. So this reason for rejecting the discounting option is, on analysis, no reason at all.</p>

But it is appropriate here to deal with two general propositions that were advanced in support of DWP&#8217;s case that the principle of equal treatment precluded any request for clarification. The first proposition was that the principle of equal treatment was an end in itself and concerned only with the treatment of bidders. The second proposition was that equal treatment was not concerned with the outcome of the competition.</p>

As to the first proposition, I repeat that equal treatment is not an end in itself. Equal treatment is simply one of the ways in which the <span style="font-style:italic">purpose</span> of public procurement are advanced. The purpose of public procurement is to ensure healthy and effective competition and to allow a proper evaluation of the tenders. It is to move away from arbitrary and capricious decision-making. Thus, when a contracting authority is considering or applying the principle of equal treatment, it must do so not as an end in itself, but always with one eye on that over-riding purpose.</p>

Furthermore, as a matter of common sense, the materiality of the obvious error or ambiguity in question is critical. If an obvious error has been made that is irrelevant to the outcome of competition then seeking clarification of it cannot affect the need for a healthy and effective competition. By the same token, if the error or ambiguity is relevant to the outcome, as happened here, then that is a potentially critical factor. So what matters are obvious errors or ambiguities that might affect the result of the tender competition.</p>

I understand of course that, because of the previous failures in the management of the tender process, it had become increasingly important to let this call-off contract as soon as possible. But there was no evidence, or attempt at rational explanation, which sought to balance, on the one hand, the importance of letting the contract as soon as possible with, on the other, the downside of awarding the contract to an inferior bid because of three clerical errors. Such evidence and such an exercise would have been required if a contracting authority was going successfully to argue that, despite all that happened, finality trumped all else. In addition, I am bound to say that, given that the failures in the tender process were, at least <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span>, the responsibility of DWP, that could hardly be used as a reason for DWP&#8217;s failure to exercise their discretion and properly consider the options available to them (including of course the option of seeking clarification).</p>

The reason that the mistake or ambiguity must be obvious is because it is not for the contracting authority to rootle through a detailed bid, looking for errors or ambiguities.

Nor was it a mistake which could be easily resolved by reference to documents within the tender itself or documents within the possession of the Defendants.  The mistake could not be resolved by an assumption that the maximum line sum had been intended, when there was no basis to infer that this was the case.  It therefore followed that any question would have to be one which inquired of the actual intended sum.   On the authorities, that would be objectionable because it opened up a change of bid or at least the opportunity for a change of bid. That infringed the principles of equality of treatment and of transparency or gave rise to a serious risk of infringing these principles.    </p>

In my judgment, that does not lead to an ambiguity.  It leads to a conclusion that Optima failed to provide a compliant bid and to make an accurate statement that it was providing a compliant bid.  If, contrary to the foregoing, there was an ambiguity, the same objections exist about seeking to find out what was intended as set out in the last two sentences of paragraph 191 above.&#8221;</p>

If the contracting authority already knows the answer, there is nothing that requires clarification, so there is no need for a request at all. Mr Suterwalla said that Regulation 56(4) was designed to allow a tenderer to <span style="font-style:italic">confirm</span> what was already in the contracting authority&#8217;s knowledge.

For the three reasons that I have given, that approach was wrong in law. But I also consider that it was not a conclusion open to the judge on the undisputed facts. The evidence was that these mistakes were so obvious that DWP themselves described two out of three of them as a &#8216;cut and paste&#8217; error. What is more, DWP would have known that these mistakes were neither here nor there, because they did not affect quality (70%) and, to the extent that it affected the evaluation of the price (30%), they made a difference of just 0.02%. They did not affect the outcome of the competition in any way, unless of course DWP decided that their very existence meant that they had to exclude Optima altogether.</p>

DWP knew, from the information that they had, what the maximum prices had to be for the call-off contract, because they knew what the Framework Maximum Prices were. So they already had all the relevant information. That was how they knew there was an obvious mistake. Moreover, if they wanted to check whether, as a result of the errors, lower figures than the Framework Maximum Prices had been intended, they could have requested clarification, since any lower figures would only make Optima&#8217;s bid even more attractive, and even more superior to that of PAM.</p>

First, they should have asked: then they would have known the answer. But secondly, what difference did that make to the outcome of the tender competition, since even with the Framework Maximum Prices replacing the three erroneous figures, the difference was nugatory? In this way, DWP&#8217;s position was a triumph of form over substance; to cite <span style="font-style:italic">Antwerpse</span>, they let it become a situation where the best tender was excluded &#8220;because of clerical errors which are obvious and insignificant&#8221;.

In addition, his reliance on <span style="font-style:italic">Adia </span>was misplaced because &#8211; unlike here - there was no obvious error or ambiguity in that case. Once it is accepted that there was an obvious error and/or ambiguity which was highly material to the outcome of the competition (because unless clarification was sought, DWP thought they could simply exclude Optima&#8217;s bid, even though it was the best), then I consider that DWP had an obligation to seek clarification. </p>

In my view, that is why Judge Waksman&#8217;s analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">Harrow Solicitors</span> is important. If there is an obvious material error or ambiguity then, until that is clarified, it may well not be possible for there to be a proper evaluation of the tender in question.

Thus, here, both Optima and at least one other bidder had made the same sort of mistake. However, the mistake(s) made by the other bidder was immaterial because, regardless of the outcome of any clarification process, the other bidder would never have won the call-off contract. Thus the other bidder&#8217;s error(s) did not affect the outcome of the competition.

Furthermore, it was wrong to elevate PAM&#8217;s compliance into an insurmountable hurdle for Optima to overcome.

There are two reasons for that. First it imposes far too great a restraint on the exercise of a contracting authority&#8217;s discretion/duty. The contracting authority has an obligation to ensure that there is a healthy and effective competition. If there is an obvious and material error which potentially undermines that purpose, then a duty to seek clarification may arise, irrespective of the answer or the potential answer. Secondly, it elevates or exaggerates the degree to which the contracting authority must assess the risks posed by the possible answer before seeking clarification. If they have a duty to seek clarification of an obvious and material error or ambiguity, then it cannot sensibly be suggested that such an obligation was somehow negated by the contracting authority&#8217;s assessment of the risk posed by the potential answer, even before they have asked the question.</p>

He said that that was because, in a case like this, it would involve &#8220;a different number&#8221;.

As noted at [89] above, these terms are not to be taken literally and, as <span style="font-style:italic">Siemens</span> demonstrates, if there is an obvious error, it can be corrected through a process of seeking clarification even if it results in a change of several hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p>

I do not agree with that analysis, but even if it was correct, it does not help DWP: the Framework Maximum Prices &#8220;were always there&#8221; and so, if they had been confirmed by Optima by way of clarification, that too was &#8220;just a function of the ambiguity&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, the answer lies in the analysis of Blake J in <span style="font-style:italic">Hoole</span> and the analysis of Judge Waksman in <span style="font-style:italic">Harrow Solicitors</span>. Blake J said that what had to be avoided were changes to the bid which improved the errant tenderer&#8217;s prospects of success in the competition. I agree with that. But as Judge Waksman said, if there is an obvious mistake or ambiguity such that the clarification is necessary in order to complete the bid, then the bid might be said to be incomplete, and will not be completed until the provision of the new information. In that way, there is only ever one bid. Those analyses have the additional advantage of meeting Mr Suterwalla&#8217;s fair point that it is important to prevent a tenderer having what he called &#8220;a second bite at the cherry&#8221;.  What he meant was that the contracting authority should not allow a tenderer to have another go at the exercise, and revise its prices in such a way that might affect the outcome of the competition. He is right about that. But if in fact, because of an obvious error, the right price for three line items had not been identified in the first place, then it may be said that the bidder is not being given a second bite at the cherry, but simply being allowed to complete the first bite. By reason of the obvious error, the figure originally intended was not in the bid.</p>

In fact, the tenderer made an obvious mistake, and filled in a date for acceptance in 2036. My Lord asked Mr Suterwalla if the contracting authority could clarify that date with the tenderer in order for the error to be corrected. </p>

The contracting authority sees that that was an obvious error and was material to the outcome. Again, could it seek clarification? Again Mr Suterwalla would have to answer in the negative, doubtless pointing to a change in the bid worth &#163;20 million. But again, and for the same reasons, that would be the wrong answer. </p>

This was in respect of item OH98. In a similar way as the two other &#8216;cut and paste&#8217; errors, the prices in the tender were transposed. That meant that the Framework Maximum Price was &#163;175, whilst the rate quoted for the line item was &#163;180. There was zero volume against this line item.

Optima had already quoted prices for all of these services in the Framework Agreement.

They already knew, therefore, the maximum amount which Optima were entitled to charge for these services. If those figures were reduced to the maximum prices, the effect on the overall price was nugatory, for the reasons referred to above. Moreover, although the judge was right to say that DWP did not know whether Optima could have bid for figures that were even lower, I have already noted (paragraphs 47 and 122 above) that that point goes nowhere. Clarification could only have resulted either in the restatement of the Framework Maximum Prices (which I consider the most likely outcome) or possibly the quotation of lower prices, which would simply have increased the gap &#8211; which was already significant &#8211; between their score and PAM&#8217;s score. To put it another way, any answer to the request for clarification could not have improved Optima&#8217;s prospects of success (as per <span style="font-style:italic">Hoole</span>); theirs always was the best bid.</p>

That is because DWP were fully aware of the three mistakes that Optima had made and which, on their evidence, were all but inevitable in this sort of process. If (and it is not entirely clear whether he did or did not) the judge had regard to fault in his conclusions as to rationality or proportionality, then he was wrong to do so.

For the reasons set out in Sections 10.3 and 10.4 above, I consider that DWP were obliged to seek clarification of those line items and could have done so without a breach of the duty of equal treatment.</p>

It is hoped that they will be able to agree the order resulting from this judgment. If not, and depending on the nature of the disagreements, a short further hearing may be required.</p>
