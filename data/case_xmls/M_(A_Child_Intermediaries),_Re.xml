		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">The court will exercise its judgement within the framework of Part 3A of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (&#8216;the FPR&#8217;) and Practice Direction 3AA.  These provisions are not complex, and they require very little elaboration.  Their relevant parts appear in the Annex below.  By following them, the court will steer a path between the evils of procedural unfairness to a vulnerable person on the one hand, and waste of public resources on the other.</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">The test for the appointment of an intermediary for any aspect of proceedings is that it is necessary to achieve a fair hearing.  Decisions are person-specific and task-specific, and the introduction of other tests upsets the balance struck by the FPR and may draw attention away from the circumstances of the individual case.</p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">Efficient case management will assist sound decision-making in this area.  There must be early identification of vulnerability where it exists.  Intermediaries are not experts, but applications for intermediary support should be approached with similar procedural discipline.  Different considerations may apply to different elements of the proceedings, and the court should normally require an application notice and/or a draft order that specifies the exact extent of the requested assistance.  </p>

	      <num style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:-0.39in">(4)</num>
	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">Correctly understood, the court&#8217;s powers are wide enough to permit it to authorise intermediary assistance for legal meetings outside the court building.  However, support that is necessary in the courtroom may be unnecessary in a less pressured setting. Accordingly, the court should give separate consideration to any application of that kind.  </p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">The Family Court is accustomed to using checklists when making procedural and substantive decisions.  The mandatory checklist in FPR rule 3A.7 is an essential reference point to ensure that the factors relevant both to the individual and to the proceedings are taken into account.  The weight to be given to them is a matter for the court, making a broad and practical assessment.  </p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">An application for an intermediary must have an evidential basis.  This will commonly take the form of a cognitive report and, if authorised, an intermediary assessment.  Other evidence may come from the social worker or the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  The court can also take account of submissions on behalf of the vulnerable person, and from the other parties, as they may have their own perspectives on the overall fairness of the proceedings.  This reflects the collaborative nature of the task of identifying and making adjustments for vulnerability.  Whatever the evidence and submissions, it is for the court, and not others, to decide what is necessary to achieve a fair hearing in the individual case. </p>

	      <num style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:-0.39in">(7)</num>
	      <content>
		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">When considering whether an intermediary is necessary, the court will consider other available participation directions.  In some cases they will be effective to secure fairness, so that an intermediary is unnecessary, or only necessary for a particular occasion, while in other cases they will not.  The court is entitled to expect specialist family lawyers to have a good level of understanding of the needs of vulnerable individuals in proceedings and an ability to adapt their communication style.  It will consider what can reasonably be expected of the advocates, and in particular of the vulnerable party&#8217;s advocate in the individual case, bearing in mind that professional continuity may not be guaranteed.  Intermediaries should clearly not be appointed on a &#8216;just in case&#8217; basis, or because it might make life easier for the court, but equally advocates should not be required to stray beyond their reasonable professional competence to make up for the absence of an intermediary where one is necessary.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">The rules provide that the reasons for a decision to approve or refuse participation directions for a vulnerable person must be recorded in the order.  That can be done very briefly, and it is a further useful discipline.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The FPR have the overriding objective of enabling the court to deal with family proceedings justly, having regard to any welfare issues involved.  This entails, so far as practicable: dealing with cases expeditiously, fairly and proportionately to their nature, importance and complexity; ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing; saving expense and allotting an appropriate share of the court&#8217;s resources.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In some cases, these goals may pull in different directions and the court must seek to reconcile them.  They all matter to everyone involved in family proceedings, but some of them are of special significance for vulnerable individuals, who may find proceedings more stressful, and delay particularly difficult.  Chapter 2 of the Equal Treatment Bench Book (July 2024) contains valuable information about the court&#8217;s duties towards them. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the present case illustrates, the Family Court is under pressure.  In care proceedings, the statutory framework provides that proceedings must be timetabled for disposal within 26 weeks, with time only being extended where that is necessary to enable the court to resolve the proceedings justly: Children Act 1989 sections 32(1) and (5).  The President of the Family Division, as Head of Family Justice, has approved a number of necessary initiatives to support the court in carrying out its obligations.  At the same time, there is a risk that pressure in any system is disproportionately felt by those least able to bear it.  Whatever may have been the situation in the past, it is now understood that the court must, so far as practicable, adapt its procedures to achieve fairness for vulnerable individuals, in particular by ensuring that all participants are on an equal footing in the light of the importance and complexity of the issues.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was this appreciation that led Parliament to introduce new provisions to the FPR on 27 November 2017.  They appear as <a href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/family/parts/part-3a-vulnerable-persons-participation-in-proceedings-and-giving-evidence" class="Hyperlink">Part 3A</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/family/practice_directions/practice-direction-3aa-vulnerable-persons-participation-in-proceedings-and-giving-evidence" class="Hyperlink">Practice Direction 3AA</a>.

The witness statement of a witness called to give oral evidence will stand as their evidence in chief unless the court directs otherwise &#8211; FPR rule 22.6(2).  Under FPR rule 3A.5, the court must consider whether the &#8216;quality of evidence&#8217; given by a party or witness is likely to be diminished by reason of vulnerability: this cannot sensibly be limited to oral evidence.  There may therefore be circumstances in which an order for intermediary assistance will be sought for a legal conference away from court, but this will call for a separate exercise of judgement.  The fact that participation in proceedings extends beyond the courtroom does not absolve the court from considering whether an intermediary is in fact necessary for that purpose in the individual case.  As noted above, the experience of a vulnerable person in a solicitor&#8217;s office, where matters can proceed at their own pace, is likely to be different from their experience of a more formal courtroom setting, and what is necessary in one setting may be unnecessary in the other.</p>

There will often be a cognitive assessment.  If it recommends the use of an intermediary, it must evidence why that is necessary and explain why alternative means are inadequate.  It would be helpful for the report to consider the party&#8217;s participation at case management hearings, legal conferences, and when giving evidence.  If the court then approves an intermediary assessment, the cognitive report should be supplied to the assessor.  The intermediary assessment itself will then form part of the evidential picture in relation to vulnerability and measures.</p>

The advocate representing a vulnerable person or seeking to call them as a witness may be well placed to assist the court from their own interactions with the vulnerable person, but it would be inappropriate to require evidence from them in the form of a witness statement.  As the process is a collaborative one &#8211; PD3AA paragraphs 1.4 and 3.1<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>&#8211; the court may also benefit from submissions made by other parties, who may also have their own interest in the decision.

The matter was transferred to Lieven J to determine whether a wasted costs order should be made against the intermediary and whether the order appointing the intermediary to assist the mother throughout the hearing should be varied.  It transpired that there had been no basis for seeking a wasted costs order and no party applied for one.  In relation to the order concerning the intermediary, no party suggested that it should be varied, and the judge confirmed the attendance of the intermediary for reasons briefly given at [48-49].  However, at [2], she said this:</p>

Counsel submitted that there was a need for intermediaries because relevant parties often did not understand the proceedings and the language that was being used. However, the &#64257;rst and normal approach to this di&#64259;culty is for the judge and the lawyers to ensure that simple language is used and breaks taken to ensure that litigants understand what is happening. All advocates in cases involving vulnerable parties or witnesses should be familiar with the Advocates Gateway and the advice on how to help vulnerable parties understand and participate in the proceedings. I am reminded of the words of Hallett LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Lubemba (Practice Note)</span> [2014] EWCA Crim 2064; [2015] 1 WLR 1579, para 45: &#8220;Advocates must adapt to the witness, not the other way round.&#8221; A critical aspect of this is for cross-examination to be in short focused questions without long and complicated preambles and the use of complex language. Equally, it is for the lawyers to explain the process to their clients outside court, in language that they are likely to understand.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I am delivering this judgment because this case seems to me to illustrate some of the issues which are emerging in the Family Courts in relation to the use of intermediaries. An intermediary can be an essential component in what the court provides to a party or witness to enable them to participate fairly in proceedings or in giving their best evidence and my own experience demonstrates their value in appropriate cases. The issue however is where is it appropriate to direct the use of an intermediary as they are not to be used as some sort of safety net or security blanket by lawyers or the courts but only where their use is necessary. Like other court funded resources (whether judicial or otherwise) they are a limited resource and a resource which comes with significant costs. Their use is governed by the procedural regime established in FPR 2010 Part 3A and PD3AA.&#8221;</p>

Proceedings were adjourned to allow a local authority to issue an application for a placement order, which the mother did not oppose, but to which she could not consent.  The mother had been assessed by a psychologist who found her to be functioning at the low average range of adult cognitive capacity.  He identified features of borderline personality disorder, substance misuse and depression.  A direction had been given for an intermediary assessment and Communicourt provided a recommendation for an intermediary to be appointed to assist the mother for the duration of the proceedings, including at any conferences.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In so far as participation directions may be required arising from vulnerability within the meaning of FPR3A.4 and 3A.5 are concerned I do not consider that the recommendation referred to at para 6 above in any sense gets close to establishing that an Intermediary is necessary to assist the mother to participate in the proceedings or to give evidence.  It may be that her participation may be improved by having a specialist in communication assist her but having regard to the limited range of issues in which the mother&#8217;s capacity is diminished I am more than satisfied that her solicitor and counsel would be able to ensure she was able to participate in the proceedings fairly by taking account of the intermediary advice as to avoiding the use of figurative language, complex vocabulary and sentences and otherwise. Those sorts of adaptations of language and approach are part and parcel of the skill-set of solicitors and advocates. Taking sufficient time to go through evidence, to explain more complex aspects of the expert evidence, taking time to establish that Mother understood the allegations and to take instructions are also part of the usual skills of lawyers; particularly those who have for instance undertaken the professional organisations training on working with vulnerable parties and witnesses. I am not even sure in this case that an Intermediary would be desirable still less necessary. The relationship of trust which is built between solicitor and client and counsel and client has an intrinsic value and the introduction of an intermediary may not always be a help unless it really is necessary.&#8221;</p>

Continuity of representation had been important and the intermediary had been integral to the proceedings so far.  Despite the use of simple language, the mother had difficulty in understanding matters and retaining information.  The seriousness of the upcoming fact-finding hearing and the lifelong implications of the decision were noted.  At the end of submissions, counsel asked if she could be of further assistance and reminded the court of Ms Bradley&#8217;s presence.  The judge thanked her and said that he did not need further information.  He then moved directly to give his decision without inviting submissions from the other parties.</p>

There had been two Guardians; the first had filed an early analysis noting that the mother struggled to verbally respond to basic greetings and simple questions about herself and her child without significant input and support from the grandmother, while the current Guardian had grave concerns as to the mother&#8217;s ability to manage in court without significant support.  The position of the grandmother, who knew the mother better than anyone, also deserved particular consideration when considering the overall fairness of the proceedings.  As one of the listed potential perpetrators, she was now unable to support either of her children within the litigation about her grandchild and she had a clear interest in knowing that they were being properly supported by others while she conducted her own case.</p>

On the basis of complex and extensive evidence the court was being asked to attribute responsibility for her child&#8217;s injuries to her or to one of her close family members.  One of a range of distressing possibilities was that the court&#8217;s findings would prevent her having the care of this child or any future children.  The fact-finding process was emotionally charged and the proceedings were at a highly pressured stage.  The judge did not sufficiently consider the impact of these matters on the presentation of the mother&#8217;s case and on her likely experience of the proceedings.  He did not explain how it could be fair for her, or for her counsel, to be expected to manage without a key part of the support structure that had been provided at three case management hearings.</p>

There was no determination of what such arrangements would be and why they would be sufficient.
