	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">This is an application for judicial review by the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">the Council</span>&#8221;) against the Commissioners for Local Administration, who are commonly referred to as the &#8220;Local Government Ombudsman&#8221; (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">the LGO</span>&#8221;).  The Council seeks the quashing of a report produced by the LGO dated 10 October 2022 in which the LGO upheld a complaint of maladministration against the Council following a complaint to the LGO by Mr X.  Mr X complained that the Council was responsible for maladministration when it failed to uphold a complaint he had made that he was wrongly required to pay fees to a privately operated nursery where his child was provided with childcare as part of the government&#8217;s Free Early Education Entitlement (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">FEEE</span>&#8221;) scheme. The relevant childcare nursery which charged the fees is operated by Tops Day Nurseries Limited (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">the Nursery</span>&#8221;).  The Nursery was named as an Interested Party in these proceedings in the claim form but has taken no part in these proceedings.</p>

An order was made to that effect earlier in the proceedings.  As he is not a party to these proceedings, is not named in the LGO report and his circumstances are largely generic, there is no benefit in him being named.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Mr X&#8217;s daughter was provided with childcare by the Nursery, which operates in the Bournemouth area, under the FEEE scheme.  Mr X complained to the Council that he was wrongly required by the Nursery to pay additional charges for some of the hours when his daughter was being provided with care by the Nursery.  Mr X&#8217;s complaint set out his view that state funded childcare was supposed to be free of charge to parents and so he should not have been charged any top-up fee.  He sought reimbursement of the additional fees that he had been charged.  The Council did not uphold his complaint.  Mr X was dissatisfied with the Council&#8217;s response and so he complained to the LGO.  The LGO upheld his complaint.  After providing the Council with a series of draft reports and inviting their comments, the LGO produced a report which criticised the Council.  The Council then brought these proceedings arguing that, in doing so, LGO had proceeded on an incorrect legal basis as well as challenging the report for other reasons.  In summary, the Council&#8217;s case is that the LGO made errors of law because it misunderstood how the FEEE statutory scheme operates and submits that those errors of law should lead to this court quashing the report.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Council was represented by Mr Peter Oldham KC and the LGO by Ms Hannah Slarks.  I am grateful for the assistance I have received from both counsel and the legal teams instructing them.  The issues in this case were argued with particular fairness and courtesy by counsel on both sides, acknowledging that the case had potential implications for local authorities generally.  Both counsel were mindful of the tension between parents, nurseries and local authorities over the vexed issue of the extent to which nurseries can lawfully charge parents fees for funded nursery places.  Both counsel submitted that any decision in this case had the potential to affect other local authorities and nurseries generally.  This case may also have implications for the LGO because the LGO fairly informed the court that, in preparing for this case, she<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">I am very cautious about expressing any views in this judgment which could be seen to have wider implications for local authorities and nurseries taking part in the FEEE scheme which are not strictly necessary for me to determine the challenge in this individual case.  This judgment should only be taken as expressing views on the lawfulness of this particular LGO report based on the facts of this particular case.  In doing so, I will have to consider the lawfulness of the specific criticisms that the LGO has made of the Council&#8217;s conduct given the specific facts arising in this particular case.  There are likely to be many other issues arising in other factual scenarios relating to other charges that nurseries may potentially seek to ask parents to pay who are accessing FEEE hours.  Nothing in this judgment should be taken to setting out a view on the lawfulness of any other factual situations.  The Secretary of State was invited to intervene in this case but declined to do so.  If this case is to go any further, I have little doubt that the Court of Appeal would be assisted by representation by the Secretary of State.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The background to this issue is relatively well known but is worth setting out in order to understand why a dispute involving relatively small amounts of money for Mr X is being taken so seriously by both the Council and the LGO.  Childcare in the UK consumes a significant proportion of the budgets of parents of young children, particularly in the years before they attend schools.  Parents on medium to low incomes can find themselves having to pay a significant proportion of their earnings to meet childcare costs, particularly if they have more than one pre-school child.  In order to assist this group of parents, the government provides funding to support the cost of nursery placements for defined categories of parents of pre-school children of defined ages up to a maximum number of hours per week.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The government channels the moneys to fund nursery places through local authorities, and it requires at least 95% of this funding to be passed on to nurseries who are providing FEEE places.  In this case I am told that the Council passported about 99% of the government funding through to those nurseries that provide childcare places under the government scheme in the Council area.  The sum paid by the government to local authorities effectively sets the rate that local authorities are able to pay to nurseries that participate in the FEEE scheme.  Some childcare under the scheme is provided by local authority operated schools but much of the childcare under the FEEE scheme is provided by nursery businesses that operate in the private sector.  These businesses will be registered with Ofsted and operate under the regulatory regime set out by Ofsted.  They will typically provide childcare to children whose parents pay for their services and may also elect to provide childcare to qualifying children under the FEEE scheme.</p>

	  <num style="font-size:11pt">8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Local authorities are under a statutory duty to secure that sufficient state funded childcare is available in their area to meet the needs of all eligible children.  In practice that means encouraging as many nursery businesses as possible to agree to provide childcare through the FEEE scheme.  It is not in dispute that those representing nurseries have complained that the amount nurseries are provided per child per hour under the FEEE scheme is too low.  It is common ground that it is generally lower than the amount nurseries charge paying parents.  Some even claim that the sums provided under the scheme are insufficient even to meet the costs of providing childcare to meet the standards required by the regulator, Ofsted.  I am not in a position to express any views about the merits or otherwise of those complaints.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Local authorities seek to support nurseries to deliver childcare under the FEEE scheme although, in practice, each nursery has to make its own decision whether to take part in the scheme or not.  Nurseries are private businesses and it is a matter for each nursery to decide whether their business wishes to be part of the FEEE scheme.  It is obviously more attractive for nurseries to take part in the FEEE scheme if they are able to secure additional revenue from parents whose children are supported under the FEEE scheme.  Thus, both local authorities and nursery providers have their own reasons for seeking to support nurseries in making additional charges.  I accept that local authorities have a real concern that taking a hard line on top-up charges could lead to a diminution in the availability of FEEE childcare in their area and thus may make it more difficult for local authorities to deliver on their statutory duties.</p>

I am told by the LGO that a model provider agreement was published by the Secretary of State and that that document was used by the Council as a template for setting up its agreement with the Nursery.  The version of the agreement in the bundle is unsigned but it appears clear that the agreement was intended to set up a legally enforceable contract between the Council and the Nursery (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">the Agreement</span>&#8221;).  </p>

The regulations around staff to child ratios are very rigid. Therefore it would not be operationally possible that some children are excluded from an activity such as yoga or boogie mites. Nor would it be financially viable to pay for the wages of a member of staff to look after a child that is not taking part in a general extra activity&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">In my judgment, there are two main difficulties for the Council arising out of this response.  First, as the Council rightly now concedes, the Council acted wrongly in that it failed to treat Mr X&#8217;s email as a complaint which should have been considered and determined in accordance with the processes set out by the Local Authority Social Services and National Health Service Complaints (England) Regulations 2009 (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">the Complaint Regulations</span>&#8221;).  Although the complaint was about the actions of an independent business, that business was delivering Council funded services and was operating services under contract with the Council.  It follows that Mr X&#8217;s complaint should have been treated by the Council as a complaint about services where the Council had a measure of responsibility and which thus came within the Complaint Regulations.  The Council was criticised by the LGO for not having followed the processes under the Complaint Regulations when it initially adjudicated on this complaint.  Mr Oldham KC has stressed that this aspect of the LGO report is not in dispute and it is not the subject of this challenge.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The second difficulty for the Council is that the response to Mr X&#8217;s complaint did not engage with the core complaint he made.  It was factually correct for the Council to say that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Tops offers free entitlement places during the non-core hours</span>&#8221;.  However, that response did not engage with Mr X&#8217;s  complaint that parents should not have been charged additional sums for any FEEE funded hours, whether those hours were within or outside core hours.  The fact that Mr X could, at least in theory, have avoided these charges by booking his daughter into the Nursery for non-core hours is not an answer to his complaint.  In practice, only booking his daughter into the nursery for non-core hours may not have been a practical option for Mr X if, as will be the case for many working parents, his working arrangements required him (and possibly his spouse or partner) to be at work during core hours.  The response from the Council failed to engage with the main point raised by Mr X, namely whether the Nursery was entitled to raise a mandatory charge of &#163;1.84 per hour for any FEEE funded hour of childcare.</p>

These responses make it clear that, contrary to the way that the general charges were described in the Nursery&#8217;s Terms and Conditions, the &#163;1.84 per hour charge was not being levied for any identifiable &#8220;consumables&#8221;. Instead, it was a general charge levied on parents who accessed funded hours during core hours with the aim of increasing the overall revenue of the Nursery.  Ms Faure said that the charge was needed to meet the costs incurred by the Nursery in delivering childcare provision &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">to our brand standard&#8221;.  </span>The Nursery has not taken part in these proceedings and thus I express no view on whether, if the Nursery had done so, it could have provided evidence to support that assertion.

There was a long and unfortunate delay between the issuing of these proceedings and the matter being referred to a Judge for a paper decision on permission.  Permission for this challenge was granted on all but one of the pleaded grounds by Mr CMG Ockleton, sitting as a Judge of the High Court, on 23 February 2024.   The Council renews its application in respect of that one ground and also applies to amend its grounds to raise two fresh grounds of challenge based (a) on a complaint that the LGO ought to have refused to investigate this complaint because Mr X had a legal remedy as an alternative to making a complaint and (b) based on alleged inconsistencies between the Report and other LGO decisions where, on similar facts, the LGO had reached different decisions.  The LGO has served Detailed Grounds of Resistance and both parties have filed evidence.  I shall consider the grounds of challenge below but first it is necessary to set out the statutory frameworks and reach conclusions on the main issue between the parties, namely whether mandatory additional charges are permissible within the statutory scheme.</p>

That dispute, in part, involves the Court determining the correct meaning of the words of the Guidance. Both counsel accept that the correct meaning of guidance is a matter for the court. It is also agreed that guidance should be given a common sense meaning and that it should not be interpreted as if it were a statute:  see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">Tesco Stores Ltd v Dundee City Council </span><span style="font-family:Aptos">[2012] PTSR 983.  It is the Council&#8217;s case that the statutory scheme and guidance does not have the effect of requiring LAs to ensure that there are no compulsory charges and that there is no strict rule on exactly what goods and/or services must be free when delivered along with FEEE funded childcare.  This, Mr Oldham KC submits, is because provision, and what is on offer, will legitimately vary across providers.  </span></p>

He invites me to read the paragraph as meaning that local authorities should ensure providers know they can make charges and that parents can be expected to pay some charges.  He also relies on the part of the Guidance which provides that, if parents don&#8217;t pay charges, the nursery alone decides what to do to resolve that situation.  Mr Oldham submits that one permissible option for a nursery is making such charges mandatory.  A key part of Mr Oldham&#8217;s argument is that the expression &#8220;top-up fees&#8221; should be strictly limited to the way that this expression is explained in the 2018 Guidance, namely that it can only mean &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">any difference between a provider&#8217;s normal charge to parents and the funding they receive from the local authority to deliver free places&#8221;.  </span><span style="font-family:Aptos">Mr Oldham KC argues that a mandatory fee to cover, for example, &#8220;consumables&#8221; would not be a top-up fee and thus is not prohibited by the Guidance.</span></p>

She submits that, in order to resolve the question as to whether additional mandatory charges are permitted, it is necessary to start with the statutory scheme.  She submits that the primary aim of the statutory scheme is set out in s7(1) CA, namely to provide early years provision to parents which is &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">free of charge</span><span style="font-family:Aptos">&#8221;.  She relies on s20 which provides that early years provision means &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">the provision of childcare for a young child</span><span style="font-family:Aptos">&#8221;.  She also relies on the wide definition of &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">childcare</span><span style="font-family:Aptos">&#8221; in s18 CA which provides </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">&#8220;Childcare&#8221; means any form of care for a child and, subject to subsection (3), care includes (a) education for a child, and (b) any other supervised activity for a child&#8221;.  </span><span style="font-family:Aptos">She relies on the fact that the provision of childcare is an activity which is regulated by Ofsted under a separate legislative regime.  That regime sets the standards for those who are providing childcare and explains, for example, the minimum staffing ratios which have to maintained by a provider and the minimum specification for any premises used for providing childcare.  In answer to Mr Oldham KC&#8217;s objection  that the CA does not define what is and is not included within the meaning of the term &#8220;childcare&#8221;, Ms Slarks refers to the parallel system of Ofsted regulation of childcare and the fact that the 2014 Regulations make express reference for the need for nursery providers taking part in the FEEE scheme to have been awarded a grade of "good," or better, in the most recent early years provision inspection report published in respect of the provision:  see Regulation 6(1) of the 2014 Regulations.  </span></p>

She submits that this means that, as a minimum, qualifying parents are provided with a service from a qualifying provider under which they are able to drop their child off at the agreed time and pick the child up at an agreed time, with parents being assured that, whilst in the care of the provider, the child being cared for by the provider during those hours to a standard consistent with Ofsted requirements.

In my judgment the primary statutory duty on local authorities is to ensure that FEEE hours are available to all qualifying parents of pre-school children on a &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">free of charge</span><span style="font-family:Aptos">&#8221; basis: see s7(1) CA.  The key point (as made by Mr X) is that if nurseries are permitted by local authorities to impose compulsory charges on parents as a condition of accessing FEEE hours then, by definition, FEEE funded childcare would not be free of charge to parents.  A service which is only available to those parents who agreed to pay the additional fees cannot, in my judgment, be properly described as being a &#8220;free&#8221; service.  Subject to one point, I have no difficulty in interpreting the Guidance in a way that is consistent with that legal framework.  </span></p>

Ms Slarks&#8217; full argument would lead to a conclusion that items which were consumed in a nursery which were part and parcel of the essential provision of childcare to the standards mandated by Ofsted are part of the service for which the provider is being paid by the local authority.  That would tend to suggest that such items should not be part of a separate charge to parents.  The childcare service would not be &#8220;free of charge&#8221; to parents if there was a mandatory charge for toilet paper, light bulbs or wet wipes.  The point does not strictly arise in this case because the Nursery made it clear that the general charges of &#163;1.84 per hour for any hour which was utilised within core hours was not charged for defined consumables.  It may be argued that the term &#8220;consumables&#8221; in the Guidance could have been intended to mean extra items which are consumed in a nursery for a particular child other than items which are part and parcel of the essential provision of childcare to the standards mandated by Ofsted. I do not express any final views on the extent to which &#8220;consumables&#8221; can or cannot be subject to additional charges because here the Nursery made it clear that the general charges were not for identifiable consumables and thus the point does not fall for a decision in this case.</span></p>

That interpretation is consistent with the terms of the model provider agreement. I also note that is what the agreement between the Council and the Nursery provided in this case.  It would not, in my judgment, have been open to the Secretary of State to issue statutory guidance which sought to depart from that core element of the statutory scheme.  The construction of the Guidance advanced by Mr Oldham KC on behalf of the Council would, in my judgment, have contradicted that core element of the FEEE scheme.

These paragraphs make clear that FEEE hours must be available to be accessed by a parent (or parents) without a parent being required to pay anything to the nursery provider.  In my judgment, Ms Slarks is right to say that the &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">must</span><span style="font-family:Aptos">&#8221; in the sentence that charges &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">must be voluntary</span><span style="font-family:Aptos">&#8221; means &#8220;must&#8221; in the sense explained in the Guidance, namely it is a requirement of the statutory scheme.  The use of that word properly reflects the statutory scheme and thus draws the attention of local authorities to the fact that, under the statutory scheme that local authorities are operating on behalf of the Secretary of State, any proposed charges for FEEE hours must be voluntary.  </span></p>

Mr Oldham KC then argues that the expression &#8220;top-up fees&#8221; should not be interpreted to cover charges for goods or services provided by the Nursery, which he says was what was occurring here.  I do not accept that submission for several reasons.  First, as explained above, I do not accept that the charge here was wholly for additional goods or services.  Part of it may have been justified as reflecting the cost of the nursery providing child yoga or boogie mites, but at least part of the charge was to meet general running costs.  Secondly, parents who paid privately did not pay separately for child yoga or boogie mites, and thus, even on his case, this was a top-up charge.</span></p>

Mr Oldham KC argued that nurseries had a general right to impose mandatory charges for anything outside that very limited definition.  I do not accept that submission in relation to the facts of this case for a variety of reasons.  In my judgment, the Guidance should not be read as a statute and a general term such as &#8220;top-up fee&#8221; should not have a strained and limited meaning as Mr Oldham KC has suggested.  For example, if funded parents were charged for &#8220;consumables&#8221; and privately paying parents were not so charged, the consumables charge would be a bridging charge and thus would be a &#8220;top-up&#8221; charge as that term as explained in the Guidance.  I also note that the LGO&#8217;s main criticism of the Council was that they had failed to recognise that the objectionable feature of the fees was that they were mandatory, and that the mandatory nature of the fees went against the statutory scheme and the Guidance.  The term used by the LGO to describe these additional mandatory fees is only a secondary consideration which cannot make that primary conclusion unlawful.</span></p>

Looking at the 2018 Guidance as a whole it seems to me that the words &#8220;top-up fees&#8221; refer to any compulsory fee which the nursery seeks to require parents accessing FEEE hours to pay which has the effect of topping up the sums that the nursery receives from the local authority.  It could thus apply to a fee for a meal which the nursery provides to the child, a fee for an extra activity or a general charge which seeks to bridge any part of the gap between the fee the nursery gets from the local authority and the fee that the nursery would charge parents on a private basis.</span></p>

That means that arrangements between the nursery and parents have to be structured so that parents are able to refuse to pay any proposed charges for additional goods or services.  </span></p>

Nurseries are private sector businesses and can chose whether the take part in the FEEE scheme or not. To take an example which was raised in argument, a nursery is fully entitled to charge parents for a meal provided to a child.  But if the parent declines to pay that sum, the nursery must make arrangements under which the child can eat food provided by the parents whilst other children are eating the nursery provided food.  If an additional charge is levied for provided yoga or a trip out to a local forest (one example raised in the papers), the nursery would be fully entitled to withdraw the child from that activity and provide the child with care elsewhere in the nursery where parents cannot or will not pay that additional charge.  If a nursery elects to accept payment under the FEEE scheme for an hour&#8217;s childcare, the statutory scheme imposes a duty on the local authority to ensure that parents have the ability to access that FEEE funded hour of childcare without being required to pay any additional sums to the nursery.  </span></p>

I accept that is correct.  However, there would only be an error of law by the LGO if the LGO needed to do so in order to resolve this complaint.  In my judgment, criticising LGO over allegedly incorrect labelling of different types of mandatory charges does not assist the Council.  It was sufficient for the LGO to conclude that the charges were mandatory (as it did) and that, in making mandatory charges, the Nursery was acting outside of the statutory scheme and in breach of the terms of its Provider Agreement with the Council.  Once that conclusion was reached it was open to the LGO to conclude that it was maladministration for the Council to have rejected Mr X&#8217;s complaint and, by implication, not to have responded appropriately to the actions of the Nursery which was incorrectly imposing mandatory additional fees.  The label given to those additional fees by the LGO does not seem to me to be particularly important.</span></p>

Further, reading the information provided by the Nursery (as set out above) I can fully understand why the LGO did not reach a conclusion as to whether the &#8220;general extras&#8221; were charged for extra activities such as yoga and boogie mites or, as an alternative, were charges to cover the general costs of providing childcare to Ofsted standards.  A fair reading of the information provided by the Nursery tends to suggest the fee was intended to cover a mixture of both elements but the precise way that it was calculated was unclear.  In my judgment the LGO rightly identified the compulsory nature of the fee as being the objectionable element and thus the question as to precisely what the fee was intended to cover was of less importance.  In any event, as I have indicated above, it does not appear to me that the expression &#8220;top-up&#8221; fees in the Guidance should be limited in the way the Council submits.

The LGO now submits that, notwithstanding it accepted that there had been an error of law, the Court should not give permission to the Council to raise this issue because it would make no difference to the outcome for the Council, or if permission is granted then no relief should be provided.  It is fair to say that the Council, through Mr Oldham KC, was strongly resistant to the LGO changing its position.  He submitted with considerable force that both the Court and the LGO were in error in suggesting that the court should look at this issue through the prism of s31 SCA or he strongly resisted the suggestion permission should be refused on the ground that the outcome for the Council would be unchanged.</span></p>

Dealing always with substance (and trying not to be distracted by tendentious formulations) this means that the forbidden overlap is not merely in relation to the main subject or substance of the appeal (as was the case in ER) but includes those ancillary issues that may fall to be decided by the Tribunal. Trivia may, of course, be ignored.

As a matter of case management, I am not prepared to allow the Council to change its proposed case at such a late stage, particularly where the question as to whether Mr X might or might not have such a cause of action is hugely legally complex because he was a party to a legal contract with the Nursery under which he agreed to pay the fees for general extras if he booked core hours for his daughter and he has paid those fees.

In contrast, Ms Slarks submits that the term &#8220;outcome&#8221; in s31 is not limited to the immediate outcome of the judicial review action but the wider question as to whether, if this particular report were to be quashed and the LGO was required to reconsider Mr X&#8217;s complaint, it is highly likely that the LGO would (a) have reached the decision that it was unreasonable to have expected Mr X to issue judicial review proceedings against the Council as an alternative to making his complaint and (b) having got the law right on the issue of mandatory fees, there is no reason to think that the LGO would not issue the same or substantially the same report.</span></p>

It seems to me totally fanciful to suggest that, if the LGO had undertaken this process, she would have concluded anything other than it would have been unreasonable to have required Mr X to issue judicial review proceedings as an alternative to considering his complaint.  I accept Ms Slarks&#8217; submission that I can be confident looking at the matter as a whole that, it was highly likely that, if this matter had been considered, the LGO would have not have insisted that Mr X issued judicial review proceedings.  I reach that conclusion for several reasons.  First, I accept Ms Slarks&#8217; point that the LGO has adjudicated on many complaints of this type before and has never suggested that, instead of complaining to the LGO, the complainant should seek a remedy by way of judicial review instead.  Secondly, the LGO would have been bound to consider that judicial review proceedings would have involved Mr X in a substantial amount of work and expense and would have exposed him to a serious potential adverse costs order which was wholly out of proportion with the amounts of money he was complaining about.  Whilst I have no direct evidence on the matter, it seems to me almost inevitable that the LGO was highly likely to have concluded that it would not have been reasonable to expect Mr X to have exposed himself to that costs risk in judicial review proceedings.</span></p>

This court has consistently emphasised that judicial review is a remedy of last resort, and it is only in exceptional cases that permission will be given if the Claimant has an alternative remedy:  see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">R (Cowl &amp; Ors) v Plymouth City Council </span><span style="font-family:Aptos">[2001] EWCA Civ 1935 [2002] WLR 803 and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">R (Archer) v Commissioner for HM Revenue and Customs</span><span style="font-family:Aptos"> [2019] EWCA Civ 1021, [2019] 1 WLR 6355.

I thus consider that, if the LGO had considered this matter properly (as she accepts she ought to have done), it is highly likely if not inevitable that the LGO would have concluded that any application by Mr X for judicial review against the Council would have been refused permission because the court would have considered that Mr X had an appropriate and more convenient other remedy, namely continuing his complaint against the Council through the LGO.</span></p>

If the LGO had to reconsider and produce a fresh report, there is no basis for suggesting that the conclusions of the report would be changed.</span></p>

That was incorrect for at least three reasons: first, the Guidance recognised that the Nursery could charge whatever it wished during core hours and the Nursery was acting more generously towards parents exercising the FEEE during core hours in making only charges for Extras mandatory and not charging its full commercial rate; second, the Council had not &#8220;failed to advise&#8221; the Nursery in any respect, since the Provider Agreement accorded with the Guidance (paragraph 25 above); and third, this case had nothing to do with top-up fees in any event since top-up fees are different from charges for Extras&#8221;</span></p>

However, if the nursery did offer parents the ability to access FEEE funded hours during its core hours, it was obliged by its contract with the Council to offer those to parents free of charge (see clause 11.1 on the contract between the Council and the Nursery).  Thus, it is an inaccurate complaint to assert that the Nursery was acting &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:CIDFont+F1">more generously&#8230; in making only charges for Extras&#8221;.  </span><span style="font-family:CIDFont+F1">The correct position is that</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:CIDFont+F1">,</span><span style="font-family:CIDFont+F1"> in making these mandatory charges, the Nursery was breaching the terms of the FEEE scheme and was acting in breach of the terms of its contract with the Council.

I noted the common ground above that </span>LGO is under a duty to understand the relevant statutory scheme underpinning the decisions that the Council has made and, in assessing whether the Council is guilty of maladministration, the LGO needs to understand what the Council is required to do and where it has room for making discretionary decisions.   The Council&#8217;s real complaint here is that the LGO allegedly had a closed mind to the Council&#8217;s arguments that, as a matter of the proper construction of the FEEE statutory scheme, the Nursery was entitled to impose mandatory charges.  There are two separate answers to that point advanced by the LGO.  First, Ms Slarks says that the reports were clearly marked as being in draft and the LGO was genuinely open to making changes if it was persuaded that changes were appropriate.  She relies on the changes which were made in response to each draft, including the change in respect of the Council&#8217;s duties in relation to Guidance.  I accept that submission.  That is a complete answer to the bias or predetermination case.  </p>

It seems to me that this submission must be correct and is apposite here.  A decision maker such as the LGO has a duty to understand and apply the relevant legal framework.  This is not an area of discretionary judgment but is a duty on the LGO.  I accept that the Council had a different view of the relevant legal framework here and sought to persuade the LGO that their view was correct and that, as a result, the mandatory charges imposed by the Nursery were permissible under the statutory scheme.  On this issue, for the reasons set out above, the Council were incorrect in their analysis and the LGO was correct.  In those circumstances, the LGO cannot have been biased or be guilty of predetermination when it followed a decision-making process which allowed the Council the opportunity to make representations on the relevant legal framework and then rightly rejected them.

The Council knew that was the case but nonetheless dismissed Mr X&#8217;s complaint.  It can only have done so based on the mistaken basis that imposing mandatory charges did not amount to a breach of scheme and that there was no breach by the Nursery of its agreement with the Council.

What was in dispute here was whether it was a breach of the terms of the statutory scheme for a nursery provider to charge mandatory fees.  The LGO had decided in the Leicestershire case that mandatory fees were impermissible.  Whilst the Council disagreed, in my judgment that disagreement was based on a misunderstanding of the statutory scheme.  What was at stake here was an issue of law, not an issue of evaluative assessment.  I don&#8217;t accept that the LGO can have been guilty of either bias or predetermination on the basis that it approached this case with a correct understanding of the legal framework in contrast to the Council&#8217;s misunderstanding of that framework.</span></p>

Ms Slarks thus submits that undertaking research into past decisions was as easy for the Council as it was for the LGO.  I accept Ms Slarks&#8217; submission that, in the absence of a challenge based on consistency with other reports, there was no duty on the LGO to make disclosure of other reports.  However, although these reports were publicly available, as permission has been given and the approach of the LGO is under judicial scrutiny, the fact that the parties have only recently alighted on this point is not, of itself, strong enough to justify refusing to look at this ground on its merits.</span></p>

In summary the Council&#8217;s case is that the LGO has failed to adopt a consistent approach and has thus reached inconsistent decisions in different cases.  To that extent, Ms Slarks accepts the substance of the Council&#8217;s case because the LGO now accepts that a significant number of these decisions were taken by applying principles which were different to the principles applied in the instant case.  </span></p>

Ms Slarks frankly accepts that, some of the decisions were simply wrong because the LGO either misunderstood the relevant statutory framework or failed properly to apply that framework to the facts.  Whilst there are times when an LGO report has adopted the same approach as demonstrated in this case, it is common ground that the LGO has produced a series of other reports that are not consistent with each other and are not consistent with the LGO&#8217;s present understanding of the FEEE legal framework.

In this case in summary the LGO says that she departed from previous decisions because she reached a final and settled view of the legal framework relating to the FEEE scheme and that, as a result, she declined to follow previous decisions which applied a different legal framework or which were inconsistent with her now settled understanding of the legal framework.  As I mentioned above, it is common ground that the LGO is required to understand the relevant legal framework when making decisions and thus changing the LGO&#8217;s approach away from approaches taken in prior reports to comply with that duty cannot be irrational.</span></p>

It can treat apparently like cases differently as long as it has a rational reason for the difference of treatment.  In this case the LGO is following the line set out in the LCC case, as confirmed in a Press Release.  This Council and other local authorities were thus on notice that this was how the LGO saw the obligations on local authorities in relation to additional charges being imposed on parents who were accessing FEEE funded childcare.  Whilst I accept that the LGO has not consistently followed the approach set out in the Press Release in subsequent decisions (as it ought to have done), I do not accept that it was conspicuously unfair for the LGO to decide this case in a way that was consistent with the LCC Press Release. </span></p>

First, she submits that the only LGO report which is being challenged in these proceedings is the one published in response to Mr X&#8217;s complaint.  No challenges have been made in respect of other LGO reports.  The fact that the LGO now accepts that these decisions were made applying an incorrect legal framework does not mean that they fall to be quashed in these proceedings.  Those other reports have not been the subject of any timely challenge. Secondly, she relies on </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">R (Piffs Elm Ltd) v Commission for Local Administration in England &amp; Anor</span><span style="font-family:Aptos"> [2023] EWCA Civ 486 for the proposition that, once the LGO has published a final report, the LGO is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">functus officio</span><span style="font-family:Aptos"> and has no power to re-write an earlier report, even if the LGO subsequently reaches the view that the conclusions reached in those reports were based on a misunderstanding of the relevant statutory scheme. </span></p>

That might lead the LGO to reflect on whether to continue to publish existing decisions which contradict that position or to add a caveat to those published decisions to the effect that they may not reflect the correct legal framework.  However embarrassing it may be for the LGO to have to admit to having published a series of past decisions which failed to reflect the correct legal framework, I cannot see that that justifies the quashing of a report which is based on a correct understanding of the legal relevant framework.  </span></p>

It ought to have been abundantly clear to the Council that the main concern raised by the LGO was that the Nursery was charging mandatory additional fees and that this was not permissible under either the statutory scheme or under the Provider Agreement.  I fully accept that officers of the Council may have concerns that giving a clear message to this Nursery and other nurseries in their area that any charges to parents who are accessing FEEE hours are required to be voluntary may be a difficult message to deliver and that the officers might have legitimate concerns that some nurseries may respond to that message by reducing the scope of the FEEE hours that they make available to local parents.  </span></p>

S.7 CA provides that &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">early years provision of such description as may be prescribed is available free of charge, in accordance with any regulations under this subsection&#8221;.  </span><span style="font-family:Aptos">FEEE hours are hours of childcare that are delivered in accordance with the Regulations and thus any nursery which takes the benefit of the FEEE payments must also accept the burden that such hours must be &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Aptos">free of charge&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Aptos">to parents, and hence no mandatory additional charges should be imposed.  Whilst it clearly would be unfortunate if communicating that message to participating nurseries in a clear manner may reduce the scope of the FEEE hours that nurseries make available to local parents, that cannot be a good reason to permit nurseries to act in breach of the terms of the scheme and/or in breach of the terms of their provider agreements with the Council.

It follows that, as this judgment will become public in due course, all of the material parts of the report will come into the public domain in any event.  It thus appears to me that there are serious questions about the utility of the relief that the Council seeks.</span></p>

There has been correspondence between the LGO and the Council about publication which, whatever may have been said, does not in my judgment, to a decision by the LGO which can be challenged in these proceedings because the LGO has not yet taken a decision.  The Council also sought to rely on an out of date statement on the LGO website which suggests that it always publishes reports.  That statement is no longer on the LGO website and, as the LGO has made clear in  correspondence, she now accepts that she has a discretion to decide whether to publish or not.  </span></p>
