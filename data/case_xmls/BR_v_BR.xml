She proposes a 50% Wells sharing arrangement for C Ltd and E Ltd, so that her value is ultimately extracted upon realisation, and for H to buy her out in respect of D Ltd (although as a fallback option she suggests a 50% Wells sharing arrangement) and the other business interests. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">W struck me as somewhat rigid and inflexible in her approach. She has relied heavily on her corporate lawyers and shadow accountants, and has developed an accountancy driven approach to outcome, as well as scepticism about the SJE, whose valuations she regards as too low. At times, I felt she was looking at the case as a Companies Act petition, rather than a financial remedies upon divorce hearing. Although she expressed concern about how H has &#8220;kept her in the dark&#8221; about business matters both before and after separation, she struggled to give me a concrete example of something he has done to &#8220;do her down&#8221; as H&#8217;s counsel put it in cross examination.  She told me that she does not trust H and is highly suspicious of him; whether that is justified or not (and in my view it is not), it infects her view of the case. I did not develop any confidence that she and H (or she and other shareholders) would be able to work together cooperatively should there be a Wells sharing arrangement. There was a certain irony during W&#8217;s evidence. The more she emphasised her mistrust of H, the more difficult it became for me to see how they could be expected to cooperate efficiently, and economically, if they remain tied together in the businesses. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I found H to be generally fair. I do not think he has entertained any thoughts of in some way doing W down, as was repeatedly suggested to him. He told me that the business is his life&#8217;s work, he wants to continue in it for as long as he can, and he does not want to sell or transfer his shares if he can possibly avoid it. But he recognised that W is entitled to a fair division after what he said was an equal marital partnership. He is confident he can raise personal borrowing to buy W out (and has had positive indications from banks whom he has visited), but if unable to do so he accepts that shares would have to be sold. He told me he thinks the SJE valuation is &#8220;solid&#8221;, and comfortably within a reasonable range. He was unimpressed by W&#8217;s suggestion that she buy him out at a higher figure than the SJE valuation would suggest, describing it as &#8220;a ruse&#8221;. He told me that when they separated, his preference would have been to carry on under the terms of the Deeds of Gift (to which I shall return), but that was not acceptable to W. Thereafter he made a Wells sharing offer, but as the litigation progressed, it became clear to him that such an arrangement would be unworkable, and he pivoted to his most recent proposal that he should buy out W. He felt that W does not trust him, and he has lost faith in the possibility of cooperating under a Wells sharing arrangement, which would be &#8220;dirty, awful, a litigation nightmare&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From 1999 onwards, C Ltd grew substantially and was used as the structure through which other businesses have been developed. Over time, it went through re-organisation, but its core focus remained in the same field of technology. H gradually increased his shareholdings through transactions with WX who withdrew money from the businesses. Unlike WX, H for the most part elected to retain wealth within the businesses to grow and develop them. It is clear to me that H worked tirelessly in the businesses and has been a critical figure in their growth as leader, entrepreneur, creative thinker and team builder. He remains on the board of many of the businesses. C Ltd now employs a large number of people across several offices around the globe, and has an international reputation. In my judgement, H has been directly instrumental in the success of the businesses, and continues to be at the heart of their activities. I doubt very much that he could be replaced on a like for like basis by a hired in employee, no matter how well qualified. I also doubt whether the businesses could continue seamlessly were he to leave. In short, he is a key driver in the success of these businesses, and his departure would likely be a significant blow to them. In my judgement, W considerably underestimates the pivotal role played by H.</p>

As a result, there were four principal business assets: (i) C Ltd, (ii) F Ltd, (iii) D Ltd, and (iv) C (Investments) Ltd, which owned E Ltd and other smaller investments.

Although W was entitled to call for title (which she has not done), (i) there were restrictions on onward sale, transfer or disposal by W without H&#8217;s consent, (ii) H held voting rights for all of the shares and (iii) W was not entitled to block any sale by H of the shares unless it was for a value below twice the annual earnings figure. Thus, W acquired an economic benefit, but H retained control and W had no entitlement to a say in the business.  For the purposes of the asset schedule, I treat this holding (over 50% of C Ltd) as a jointly owned asset, although legal title remains in H&#8217;s name.</p>

H told me, and I accept, that this was principally intended to be for the benefit of management and employees, many of whom held options. H himself had no real interest in selling his shares. One possibility was an IPO, but after speaking to the London Stock Exchange it became clear that was not feasible because C Ltd was too small, and would not be able to achieve sufficient liquidity on the market. I also had the clear impression that H was somewhat lukewarm about the process. Other options have continued to be explored under the sobriquet &#8220;Project T&#8221; but H told me, and I accept, that it is largely in the long grass. There is a possibility of private equity involvement, but no active steps are being taken and he considers that any such investment would not be for a few years. </p>

Subsequent to separation, and before the October 2024 budget, the parties agreed (with the benefit of professional advice) to disassemble G Ltd for tax purposes.

She specifically recalls H saying on 17 June 2023 that the accountant would hold his pen over the line and ask H what figure should be inserted, or words to that effect. H denies this allegation, saying it is a distortion of a letter which he wrote to W and the children immediately after W asked him for a divorce. Having heard both parties, I am satisfied that H did not use those words, and did not threaten W; on this I prefer H&#8217;s account to W&#8217;s. I suspect that H said something he perhaps should not have done in the heat of the moment, which W misinterpreted. The letter sets out fairly his concerns about the value of business assets being uncertain. I suspect that in their conversation, H said words to that effect, perhaps more forcefully, which W took as meaning she might get nothing. In any event, there is no evidence of any words or actions by H thereafter designed to manipulate the figures; indeed, as the SJE process shows, quite the contrary.  </p>

H says that at other times he has thought (and said) the businesses would go bust. Any reference to &#8220;billionaire&#8221; seems to me to have been no more than a passing comment based on optimism and speculation, far removed from the values attributed by the SJE and, for that matter, far removed from W&#8217;s own assertions as to value.</p>

He has not concealed matters from the SJE. On the contrary, on 4 June 2024, he/his advisers pointed out to the SJE a computational error in her report which understated the C Ltd overall valuation by &#163;50m. There was some debate about whether the SJE was in fact alerted to it by an earlier disclosure request made by W&#8217;s legal team, but the SJE told me that the disclosure request was in respect of another matter. I am satisfied that H/his advisers spotted the error and, entirely properly, raised it with the SJE. That is not indicative of a person trying to conceal matters from W and the SJE.  He has fully cooperated with PwC, and all of his meetings and telephone calls with PwC were attended and monitored by W&#8217;s team. As the SJE says in her report: &#8220;[H] and his management team have been responsive, have provided a significant amount of information and have made themselves available to me and my team on a frequent basis throughout the process to date&#8221;. I accept that H has provided, in broad terms, the disclosure sought, although some material has been more difficult to obtain because of third party interests, but I am satisfied that overall he has provided proper disclosure, and nothing meaningful has been omitted. Indeed, H was not cross examined about non-disclosure even though it had been a recurrent theme propounded by W in the proceedings and reiterated by her in the witness box.</p>

That had a downward effect on the valuation of H&#8217;s D Ltd shares by &#163;4.1m net. This is modest in the context of the case and, so far as I can tell, the only suggestion by W of direct manipulation by H of figures during the SJE process. W was suspicious, but I accept the adjustment was done in the ordinary course of the company&#8217;s activities as they reviewed the financials, was presented by the CFO to the board, which approved it (W was shown the minutes), and was not authored by H. There was nothing untoward about this, contrary to W&#8217;s unfounded speculation. </p>

The principal one raised was a dilution of shares in C Ltd in 2024 pursuant to new Articles of Association. I acquit H of any suggestion of wrongdoing. It seems that under the terms of the Deed of Gift H did not require W&#8217;s consent, and H took legal advice on the point, but in any event the aim of the change was to help management participate in any liquidity event; the abortive consideration of an IPO made the change more desirable. H told me (and nobody dissented) that he thought the dilution of shares affected H and W equally. The parties&#8217; counsel could not agree whether it had a detrimental financial effect on either or both of the parties. I could not myself discern any prejudice caused by something which was carried out as part of the overall business strategy. As with many other things in this case, W expressed to me in oral evidence her suspicion but could not explain how or why it has adversely affected her. Having read H&#8217;s second statement and heard his oral evidence, in my judgement he has convincingly dealt with the assertions, and is acquitted of any alleged wrongdoing.  This particular example demonstrated clearly to me how difficult it would be for H and W to cooperate together within a business context; a minor matter led to a great deal of controversy, differing interpretations and dissent, as well as, no doubt, costs. </p>

The issue is whether the purchase costs should be added back on W&#8217;s side (which would arithmetically benefit H on a split of assets). It is clear from the correspondence that any purchase of a house by W was to be on account of her overall claims. It is less clear from the correspondence how costs of purchase (about &#163;1.5m) were to be treated. Given that H will (as I decide) retain the FMH in Z, as well as the family property in London, it is, in my judgement, unfair on the facts of this case to add back in costs of purchase which W had to incur to buy a new home, but H is not required to incur. I will therefore exclude the purchase costs. Following the same logic, I will allow notional costs of sale of W&#8217;s property to be reflected in the balance sheet.</p>

Some are early stage, pre revenue generating (here she refers to the non-core businesses). The value of the business interests is more volatile than would typically be the case in more stable markets.  Macro-economic factors also have an effect. As is the way with earnings valuations, she uses, in part, projections which may not necessarily prove to be correct. There is limited capital within the businesses which are essentially trading companies. The spread of values is high, reflecting volatility and fragility. C Ltd and D Ltd are fairly small companies by comparison with sector competitors (particularly in the USA), with low diversification, and other commercial factors which makes them vulnerable to, for example, imposition of trading arrangements. </p>

In the first place there is likely to be no obvious market for a private company. Second, even where valuers use the same method of valuation they are likely to produce widely differing results. Third, the profitability of private companies may be volatile, such that a snap shot valuation at a particular date may give an unfair picture. Fourth, the difference in quality between a value attributed to a private company on the basis of opinion evidence and a sum in hard cash is obvious. Fifth, the acid test of any valuation is exposure to the real market, which is simply not possible in the case of a private company where no one suggests that it should be sold. Moylan J is not a lone voice in this respect: see A v A <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/2818" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2818 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2818 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 FLR 115" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 FLR 115</ref> at [61] &#8211; [62]; D v D <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2007/278" uk:canonical="[2007] EWHC 278 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWHC 278 (Fam)</ref> (both decisions of Charles J).&#8221;</span></p>

H himself has echoed the volatility and unpredictability. They operate in a fast moving sector. The market fluctuates. They have a minimal underlying asset base. They are dependent on third party platforms. The SJE was, in my view, reasonable to consider a wide range before alighting on a valuation. The final figures for the contentious business interests are products of experience, good sense, research, and data. Multiple reference points have been considered including revenue, comparables and PORI. Any valuation of companies such as these cannot be said to be certain. They are an evaluation of the sums which might be achievable on sale to a willing buyer. The fact that they are uncertain does not mean they cannot be relied upon. They do not have to be the product of purist&#8217;s accuracy to the last penny. They need to be sufficiently accurate to achieve a fair outcome under s25.</p>

I deprecate that attempt to introduce purported expert evidence through the back door of an unsigned open offer. It is elementary that expert evidence is only admissible if the court has granted permission under Part 25 of the FPR 2010 to a party to rely upon it. In the absence of permission, it cannot be admitted or relied upon. Quite apart from that basic proposition of principle, it seems to me to be unthinkable that I should attach any weight to what W says she has been told by her own purported expert (who is likely to be more partisan than a SJE) in circumstances where there is no letter of instruction, no clarity as to what the expert was given by way of information, no report, no articulated methodology and so on.  </p>

She did not do so. In mitigation, she points out that H, until January 2025, appeared to agree that a Wells sharing approach was called for, and therefore valuation evidence was arguably less necessary. But in a case of this magnitude, where vast sums have been spent on professional fees, it was, in my judgement, unwise of her to assume that a buyout would not be considered at trial, either because one or other party changed their open proposals (as they have both done in this case), or because the court decided to pursue that possibility. And in any event, her open offer received on the eve of trial suggests buy outs in respect of all three of the contentious business interests, and proffers that route as the preferred option in the case of D Ltd.

In this case, a buyout can achieve such an outcome fairly and more swiftly than a Wells sharing arrangement. It will avoid the need for ongoing commercial ties between H and W, and between W and the businesses. It will avoid what, I am satisfied, would likely be a significant period of time to unwind a Wells sharing arrangement. It will reduce personal conflict. It will likely be beneficial to W&#8217;s health. And it will, I am confident, avoid what is otherwise likely to be heavy expenditure on legal costs implementing a Wells sharing arrangement.</p>

It would become a &#8220;hostile&#8221; sale, which in turn would be likely to further depress the price she would be able to obtain; arithmetically, on the first scenario, by 20% - 35% which equates to &#163;26m - &#163;44m net. The degree of hostility would no doubt depend on to whom she intends to sell, and on what terms. Of course, H would be one of the other shareholders which creates an immediate risk of dispute.

Again, in my view, if at some point in the future shares were to be transferred to her and then sold, the same problems as with C Ltd would occur, and potentially more so because of the involvement of U (GE). The timescale for selling shares is likely to be many years: W does not state a proposed longstop. Were the shares to be split, and control lost, the reduction in value of the combined shareholding (scenario 2) would be 10% - 20% which is about &#163;6m - &#163;12m net, and under scenario 1 it would be 30% &#8211; 45% which is about &#163;17m - &#163;25m net.</p>

Some are seasoned professional investors, who may adopt an aggressive, protective stance. Although other shareholders&#8217; interests may be aligned in terms of the desirability of enhancing value, they may not be aligned in terms of strategy and management. H thinks they would be resistant to W&#8217;s involvement, and I tend to agree. He said that senior management do not want to work with, or for, W, some would likely leave, and any acquisition of shares by W would be destabilising. WX would be resistant to W being involved, not least because of the very close commercial and friendship ties between him and H. </p>

For both C Ltd and D Ltd (the latter in the event that her buyout under option 1 is not pursued), she seeks a series of undertakings by H including in respect of management of the companies during the Wells sharing period which are fraught with difficulties, e.g. not to cause or permit the companies to cease to carry on all or a material part of the business, not to divert or redirect business or trading opportunities, not to change the scope of the nature of the business. These seem to me to be fraught with difficulties, appearing as they do to enable W to control, or be able to veto, operations. The documents contain indicative terms for sale of minority interests, and a series of &#8220;Consent matters&#8221; for the board in respect of any sale. I foresee lengthy disagreements about the documents and their implementation. In the event of dispute, the parties may need to approach the court (either the Business and Properties Court or the Family Court) for implementation. </p>

To transfer large parts of the core companies to W would be very painful to him, as would a sale. He is still young and has a lot more to offer in the businesses. He has an emotional attachment to the businesses which he developed from scratch, and to the people within it. I accept that for him it is not just about the money. He wants to remain involved for many years in something which has been his life&#8217;s work and in respect of which he remains a pivotal figure. None of this downplays W&#8217;s role in the marriage which entitles her, in principle, to half of the matrimonial assets.

Under a Wells sharing arrangement, H would continue to work in the business. The sale(s) of one or more of the three contentious business interests would be potentially several years ahead, long after separation. In those circumstances H would legitimately be able to argue that he should retain the fruit of that endeavour, and therefore have more than 50% of the sale values. I heard no detailed argument on this, let alone specific calculations, so to ascribe a particular value to post-separation work would be speculative. However, in my judgement at the very least it is a factor which militates against ongoing ties.</p>

Again, I emphasise, this is not to mandate a particular structure but to draw attention to the need to address this issue when the court is deciding how to exercise its discretionary powers so as to achieve an outcome that is fair to both parties.

The function of the court is to achieve a fair outcome; fairness is not necessarily met by an equal share by value. The courts are alive to the type of asset, and the proposed structure. There are numerous reported cases where a discount from (say) 50% is justified by a carefully calibrated balancing exercise which reflects the different nature of certain categories of assets. </p>

It was reasonable for W to instruct shadow experts given that (i) W needed to probe and test the SJE report and (ii) unlike H, W has no knowledge of the inner workings of the businesses. But even allowing for that, the difference of about &#163;1.5m is very high, and the consequence, without any reconciliation, is that H meets one half of that difference, yet he had no say in, let alone control over, the instruction of the shadow team by W. There is a far less significant disparity in the costs of the financial remedy teams (W&#8217;s total is &#163;869,246, and H&#8217;s is &#163;562,002) which does not merit any reconciliation. But the disparity in the costs of the shadow teams is too great to be ignored, and I will order W to pay H &#163;375,000 (a little under 25% of the difference), such sum to be set off against the overall distribution. </p>
