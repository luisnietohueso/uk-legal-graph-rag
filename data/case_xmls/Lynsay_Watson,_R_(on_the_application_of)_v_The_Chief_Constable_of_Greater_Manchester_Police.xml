	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">First</span>, the Interested Party posted about the reaction of other people to Brianna&#8217;s murder. He noted that it had been suggested at an early stage that the murder was hate-related; and commented as follows: &#8220;These disgusting ghouls are SO excited that a trans person has finally been murdered in the UK, so they can use it to attack [JK] Rowling and &#8220;TERFs&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

For example, the Interested Party wrote &#8220;He was a trans-identifying boy&#8221;; &#8220;Human beings can&#8217;t change sex. Being murdered doesn&#8217;t alter that. I never knowingly refer to anyone with anything other than the pronouns of their birth sex&#8221;; and &#8220;He was a boy. Human beings can&#8217;t change sex&#8221;.</p>

We do know that - without the gender recognition laws countries from Ireland to Argentina have - her death certificate will class her as a boy&#8221;. The Interested Party commented &#8220;<span style="color:#000000">Why the fuck does it even matter what&#8217;s on the death certificate? Who cares? If their parents want to bury their child under their trans name and put it on the headstone, nobody is going to stop them. Jones is just desperate to weaponise it&#8221;.</span></p>

The offence is committed only if causing distress or anxiety is at least one of the defendant&#8217;s &#8220;purposes&#8221;. In the context of s 1, &#8220;purpose&#8221; is not to be treated as synonymous (and interchangeable) with &#8220;intention&#8221;. The 1985 Law Commission Report of 1985 (Com No 147) explained (at paragraph 4.31) that the word &#8220;purpose&#8221; was deliberately chosen instead of &#8220;intention&#8221; to ensure a &#8220;sufficiently restricted interpretation&#8221; and to convey &#8220;what is appropriate in this context, namely, a desire and intention that the specified consequence &#8211; in this case distress and anxiety &#8211; should come about&#8221; (emphasis added). Criminal liability was not intended to arise in &#8220;situations where it is necessary to communicate to others information which is shocking or even menacing and, as the sender knows, will inevitably cause distress&#8221; (see paragraph 4.23). In our judgment the word &#8220;purpose&#8221; connotes something that is a motivating objective - a restrictive approach which gives further effect to the interpretative duty imposed by s 3 of the HRA.</p>

Professor Stock&#8217;s evidence shows that some involved in the debate are readily willing to label those with different viewpoints as &#8216;transphobic&#8217; or as displaying &#8216;hatred&#8217; when they are not. It is clear that there are those on one side of the debate who simply will not tolerate different views, even when they are expressed by legitimate scholars whose views are not grounded in hatred, bigotry, prejudice or hostility, but are based on legitimately different value judgments, reasoning and analysis, and form part of mainstream academic research&#8221;. </p>

That does not rob them of the protection of Article 10(1). I am quite clear that they were expressions of opinion on a topic of current controversy, namely gender recognition. Unsubtle though they were, the Claimant expressed views which are congruent with the views of a number of respected academics who hold gender-critical views and do so for profound socio-philosophical reasons. This conclusion is reinforced by Ms Ginsberg&#8217;s evidence, which shows that many other people hold concerns similar to those held by the Claimant.</p>

The judge went on to say that the police&#8217;s submissions impermissibly minimised what occurred and did not properly reflect the value of free speech in a democracy; there was not a shred of evidence that Mr Miller was at risk of committing a criminal offence [259]. It was nothing to the point that Mr Miller continued to tweet afterwards; warning him that in unspecified circumstances he might find himself being prosecuted for exercising his right to freedom of expression on Twitter had the capacity to impede and deter him from expressing himself on transgender issues. It had a chilling effect on his right to freedom of expression [260-1]&#8221;.</p>

To engage in the sort of debate reflected in the Twitter conversation at that time could, as Ms Collier, conceded, be regarded as in &#8220;shockingly bad taste&#8221;. However, that does not render the comments grossly offensive: see<span class="normaltextrun" style="color:#000000"> [35] above.

Like him, I conclude that no reasonable person could have regarded the posts in this case as grossly offensive, within the meaning attributed to that phrase in the case-law, and, to quote <span style="font-style:italic">Miller</span>, &#8220;certainly not having regard to the context in which they were sent, namely, as part of a debate on a matter of current controversy&#8221;. </p>
