For example, the urbanised area covered by the Injunction includes sites such as schools, public car parks, local businesses (such as supermarkets and other shops), sports facilities and public parks. When sites of that nature are targeted by encampments, the inhabitants of the area (and the Borough generally) suffer, as they often cannot use or access those sites, which have a high public amenity value. Further the sites on which encampments are formed are sometimes damaged (I shall discuss further below the impact that encampments have on the Borough and the sites on which they are formed), again affecting the use of the sites by the public and their amenity value. As such, the sites within the injunction area are generally not appropriate sites on which an encampment should form. </span></p>

The Court ruled that final injunctive relief can be granted against newcomer persons unknown, albeit that it held that such an injunction is neither interim nor final in substance and is instead a form of without notice relief; see paragraph 139. In essence, the Court considered the reasoning that since an interim injunction is designed only to hold the ring, pending trial between the served parties, its use against newcomers for any other purpose would fall outside the principles that regulate the granting of interim injunctions. It then considered the <span style="font-style:italic">South Cambridgeshire District Council v Gammell</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 1429 (<span style="font-style:italic">Gammell) </span>solution that a newcomer becomes a defendant by acting in breach of the interim injunction and the tidy solution to both issues as it makes the newcomer a party and at that point justifies the interim injunction against newcomers as- as put by the Supreme Court &#8211; a way of smoking them out before trial.</p>

I was told that there is no evidence that the case-by-case approach has been the subject of complaints. I pay particular regard to the evidence of Mr. Williams that this informal approach has worked in achieving a balance between the interests of Gypsy and Traveller groups and local inhabitants. In his second witness statement, he gave six examples of this toleration in action. There are no specific examples given for the last year but the Council&#8217;s flexible approach of assessing need and welfare is said by Mr. Williams to be of greater benefit to the Gypsy and Traveller community than setting up a transit pitch in an inconvenient location relative to sought out facilities. An absence of sufficient transit sites in an area (or information as to where available sites may be found) may itself be a sufficient reason for refusing a newcomer injunction (paragraph 202 <span style="font-style:italic">Wolverhampton</span>).</p>

As of 1 April 2025, 8 pitches are considered deliverable up to 2029. The reason for the increased need is due to the expansion of definition of Gypsies and Travellers, in December 2024, to include all other persons with a cultural tradition of nomadism or of living in a caravan. An updated Gypsy and Traveller and Travelling Show People Accommodation Assessment is being compiled.</p>

The same is clear from the scale and nature of the fly-tipping that was associated with some encampments (which included commercial and green waste); these people were not simply passing through the Borough and in need of a place of a temporary place of rest.&#8221;</span></p>

However, they have not been effective, and enforcement is costly. In the period 2016 to 2018, the First Claimant exercised its s77 powers on 10 occasions (with 7 occasions requiring an order to be sought under s78), at a cost of &#163;4649. Following the grant of injunctive relief, the powers were not exercised at all between April 2019 and January 2024. In the period February to December 2024, the powers were exercised once at a cost of &#163;1053.50.  It also was submitted that it can be easy for an encampment to thwart enforcement attempts under s.77 &#8211; s.78 by the encampment waiting to be served with a direction to leave the land and then move to another section of land nearby, necessitating the process to restart. It appears a neutral argument that harm is minimised if removal of the encampment is swift, as has been the result of the injunction. </p>

Mr. Williams provided evidence that he contacted the neighbouring local authorities, and they provided figures of unlawful encampments in public areas, with all being in an urban area, which is the attraction of the Injunction area. By far the largest number of unauthorised encampments is in Reading, numbering 59 according to the witness statement of Acting Inspector Beasley of Thames Valley Police. Reading is an urban area. The cessation of the Injunction, the police and council urge, will likely lead to a movement of some of these encampments to the Injunction area.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">In granting this injunction, the court takes into account the conduct of the Claimants that they take a collaborative approach when Gypsies and Travellers require a place to stop, and that enforcement always is a last resort.</p>

This type of injunction must remain as exceptional and it will be in place, in near identical terms, for a second year. It should never be a solution looking for a problem.</p>

The onus is on the Claimants to ensure that this information is communication to the court. Any application to renew should be considered again, <span style="font-style:italic">de novo,</span> with real care and scrutiny. This type of application must not dilute into a routine, or a &#8220;tick box&#8221; exercise as described by Freedman J in his judgment at paragraph 55.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">Currently the Borough is not meeting the needs of the Gypsy and Traveller community. The decision not to create a transit site is justified on a hypothetical basis that it might not be in as convenient a place as would be served by informal and formalised stopping processes. However, a transit site would satisfy anxiety of Gypsies and Travellers that they might be moved from whenever they stop in the Borough. The court expects that a transit site is reconsidered by the Claimants and consultation is carried out with the Traveller and Gypsy community.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">If the Claimants decide to make a further application to renew this injunction, they need to be prepared to address considerations into reducing the size of the area as well as produce evidence of satisfying the needs of the Gypsy and Traveller community where those needs currently are not being met. In addition, the need for a power of arrest will require review. Although there is a memorandum of understanding with Hampshire police, informal understandings amongst council officers and police can cease to work when personnel change. Intention can be harder to safeguard the longer that there is for time to pass. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.55in">Subject to my concluding remarks, the Claimants have demonstrated a compelling need for the promotion and protection of the interests of the inhabitants of the Borough.  Applying the strictures of <span style="font-style:italic">Wolverhampton </span>as required when considering precautionary relief, the court is satisfied that (a) the Claimants have exhausted all reasonable alternatives before seeking renewal of the injunction, (b) there is no other realistic or proportionate alternative to injunctive relief, (c) the statutory requirements for a power of arrest have been satisfied and (d) the Claimants have taken proportionate steps to control encampments and the depositing of waste. There is a real risk that that the offending acts will continue and will return without the restraint of an injunction. Exceptionally, the injunction is required against newcomer Persons Unknown. The court orders the injunction in the terms of the draft Order.</p>
