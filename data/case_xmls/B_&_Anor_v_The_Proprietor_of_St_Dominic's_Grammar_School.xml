      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION IN SCHOOLS (89) </span></p>
      <p>This appeal concerned the school&#8217;s decision to exclude the appellants&#8217; five-year-old daughter (B) from after school club and also to impose a fixed-term exclusion for physical behaviour towards others that the appellants contended was related to her disabilities (a physical impairment of dyspraxia and a mental impairment of social emotional and mental health difficulties (SEMH)). The First-tier Tribunal dismissed their claim that the school had discriminated against B contrary to section 15 of the Equality Act 2010 (EA 2010) on the basis that it was not satisfied that they had shown on the balance of probabilities that there was a causal connection between B&#8217;s behaviour (for which she was excluded) and her disabilities. </p>
      <p>The Upper Tribunal holds that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law, in particular by: (i) failing to take account of expert evidence to the effect that B&#8217;s SEMH could manifest in her lashing out at children, being easily aroused and becoming dysregulated; (ii) failing to decide for itself, objectively, whether there was a causal relationship between the behaviour for which she was excluded and the disabilities; (iii) perversely treating witnesses who gave evidence about factually what happened in each incident (including B herself) as giving evidence as to whether there was a causal relationship with disability; and, (iv), failing to direct itself to, and properly apply, the shifting burden of proof in section 136 of the EA 2010.</p>

The First-tier Tribunal noted that &#8220;B was said to be unable to provide an explanation for the incidents and that they were unprovoked&#8221;, but that later she admitted to her parents having kicked another child in the leg when lined up and not during an interaction with that child. The First-tier Tribunal recorded Mr B&#8217;s explanation that the incident occurred when another child &#8220;kicked of her shoe which had hurt [B]&#8221; and that in his view &#8220;the actions of his daughter arose from frustration, were retaliatory and not an unprovoked or random act&#8221;. The Tribunal noted that B &#8220;did not give this explanation to Mrs Parker-McMahon at the time. [B] is described as an honest girl who will cry and complain if she feels that she has been treated badly, but will go quiet if she believes she has done something wrong&#8221;.

It is not her physical disability, because she acknowledges that she deliberately kicked the girl, rather than inadvertently doing so as a result of poor balance or proprioception. There is no evidence to show that her actions arose from her social difficulties. She knew what she was doing, and said so. She admitted doing it when asked about it by a teacher. It is unclear if there was in fact any link with any earlier actions of the other girl, but if it was, on [B&#8217;s] own evidence to her father, it was retaliation. These things do occur, but there is insufficient evidence to show on the balance of probabilities that it is linked to [B&#8217;s] social impairment. </p>

The Tribunal noted that B was unable to provide an explanation for her actions and that there was &#8220;no evidence that, at the time of the incident, she said that it was an accident, that she did not mean to, nor did she cry and/or complain that she was being wrongly treated&#8221;. Mr B&#8217;s explanation was that another child had been teasing B about a paper cut he had which had drawn blood, that she had repeatedly asked him to stop and that when he did not do so, she attempted to push his hand away, accidentally pushing in the face and causing him a small scratch. Mr B speculated this was due to her dyspraxia. However, the Tribunal did not accept Mr B&#8217;s explanation because there was &#8220;a conflict between [B&#8217;s] failure to explain her actions when asked at school ([despite being] giving the opportunity to explain her actions and to reflect upon them) and the explanation given at some later date&#8221;.

It recorded that Mr B&#8217;s explanation was that she grabbed another child but did not mean to hurt them. The Tribunal accepted the evidence of a member of staff who witnessed the incident that B&#8217;s actions were &#8220;unprovoked&#8221; and not as a result of &#8220;skipping too fast&#8221; or &#8220;losing her balance&#8221;.

Again, it noted that B had been unable to explain why she had done those things at the time. Mr B&#8217;s evidence based on what B had said to him was that B was reacting to a child kicking her under the table, although the RB&#8217;s evidence that the child who B slapped was not the same as the child from whom she pulled away the chair. The Tribunal continued: &#8220;Had [B] been upset &#8230; this might have indicated that [B] felt she was being treated badly, but there is no such evidence. She had the opportunity to ask for help, but did not do so. It should be noted that if the problem arose from the actions of one child, [B] had three opportunities to speak to a member of staff after the slapping incident, and the two opportunities to do so after the chair incident&#8221;. Because B&#8217;s explanations to her father Mr B were given five or more days after the events, the Tribunal gave these explanations &#8220;less weight than the responses given at the time and the observations of adult staff and others&#8221;.

The Tribunal concluded at [46] that &#8220;There is no further evidence to show that the unfavourable treatment of the RB arose because of something in consequence of [B&#8217;s] disability.

However, that is not what she says at the start of the paragraph, and it seems to me that she only focuses on the &#8220;something&#8221; at this point because that is what was in issue in that case. Neither party in this appeal has sought to argue that the burden of proof should be applied differently to these two liability elements in a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref> claim and, as I have noted, on the face of the statute, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/136" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 136</ref> applies to both elements.

Where there is evidence that could indicate discrimination there is much to be said for properly grappling with the evidence and deciding whether it is, or is not, sufficient to switch the burden of proof. That will avoid a claimant feeling that the evidence has been swept under the carpet. It is hard to see the disadvantage of stating that there was evidence that was sufficient to shift the burden of proof but that, despite the burden having been shifted, a non-discriminatory reason for the treatment has been made out. </p>

For example, a child with autism spectrum disorder may find themselves overwhelmed in a social situation, unable to articulate their emotions and thus respond by quite deliberately (or, at least, apparently quite deliberately) taking out their frustrations physically on a person or object.

Although all five incidents apparently involved B lashing out at other children, and the Tribunal had before it expert evidence which it summarised as being that B had social emotional and mental health difficulties that led to her &#8220;lashing out at children, being easily aroused and becoming dysregulated&#8221;, the Tribunal does not even mention it. While it is hard to believe that the Tribunal really had let this evidence slip its mind given that this was not a document-heavy case, the fact that at [26] and [40] and [46] it said that there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221; to link B&#8217;s behaviour with her disability makes it clear that the Tribunal did fail to take into account this evidence.

The Tribunal&#8217;s approach is the sort of approach that would need to have been taken if there was an issue as to why the RB took the action it did, i.e. whether it was because of B&#8217;s behaviour, or because of antagonism towards her parents or some other reason. If that had been the question, then it would have been correct for the Tribunal to focus on the reasons the relevant staff member(s) had for acting as they did. The answer to that question would still have been a matter for the Tribunal to determine, by drawing inferences from all the circumstances as to what the RB&#8217;s true reason for acting was, but the evidence of witnesses as to what they thought they were doing would have been highly relevant. However, this was not a case in which there was any issue as to why the RB did what it did. It was agreed that the RB took action because of B&#8217;s behaviour. The task for the Tribunal was to determine objectively whether B&#8217;s behaviour was causally connected to her disability. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:Arial">However, the Tribunal has erred in law in this case in its approach to that evidence. Where it says there is &#8220;no evidence&#8221; of a link to her social disability, it apparently says that because either B has not said it was because of her disability and/or because the RB&#8217;s witnesses considered her conduct to be deliberate and not because of her disability. Insofar as the Tribunal regarded the views of five-year-old B as actually being evidence that bore directly on the question of whether her behaviour was related to her social impairment, that was in my judgment irrational. Likewise the school&#8217;s witnesses were witnesses of fact, they do not appear to have expressed opinions about causal relationship to B&#8217;s disability, their evidence (as it appears in the Tribunal&#8217;s decision) was just about what happened and whether B&#8217;s conduct appeared to be deliberate or not. While I can see that it was in principle relevant to the question of whether the conduct was related to B&#8217;s physical impairment of dyspraxia whether it was deliberate or not (although, even then, the dyspraxia may have been relevant to the amount of damage/hurt B caused when lashing out deliberately), witness evidence on whether the conduct appeared to be deliberate or not could shed only the most limited light on whether the behaviour was related to B&#8217;s social impairment. As such, it was perverse for the Tribunal to regard the fact that the school&#8217;s witnesses did not say they thought B&#8217;s conduct was related to her disability and/or the fact that the conduct appeared deliberate as meaning there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221; of such a causal relationship.</span></p>

The Tribunal noted &#8220;The claimant does not allege in this case that it arose from [B&#8217;s] social impairment&#8221;. It is understandable why the Tribunal said this, and indeed why much of its decision seems to focus on the question of whether there was a link between the behaviour and B&#8217;s dyspraxia. That is because this was the appellants&#8217; primary case in relation to this and some of the other incidents. Their belief was that at least some of the behaviours were accidental, with harm resulting from B&#8217;s &#8216;clumsiness&#8217; as a result of her dyspraxia. However, the parties are agreed that the case as set out in the original claim form, identified at case management stage, and advanced at the hearing, formally included both B&#8217;s disabilities. Mr Edwards before the Upper Tribunal has made clear that if he had been asked if the appellants were also relying as a &#8216;fallback&#8217; on B&#8217;s social impairment in relation to these elements of the claim, he would have said &#8216;yes&#8217;.</span></p>

It did dispute that B&#8217;s difficulties amounted to disabilities, and that it had knowledge of that, and it also advanced in the alternative a case that if there was less favourable treatment for a reason relating to disability, that treatment was justified. If these were proceedings to which the Civil Procedure Rules applied (cf CPR 16.5(3) and (5)), this might have created a difficulty for the respondent and represented a further potential error in the Tribunal&#8217;s decision in this case. However, &#8220;pleadings points&#8221; such as this do not have the same implications in this jurisdiction. What matters is fairness and that the parties and the Tribunal understand the issues that are in dispute and the parties have a fair opportunity to deal with them. In the light of the respondent&#8217;s clarification in response to the appeal, it is clear that the respondent did actively dispute the causal link at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal and that the appellants were not under any misapprehension as to the respondent&#8217;s position. </span></p>

The rationale for introducing the shifting burden of proof in discrimination claims was, as the case law I have set out above explains, because of the well-recognised difficulty for a claimant in proving that a person&#8217;s actions were materially, but probably unconsciously, influenced by a protected characteristic. In <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref> claims the difficulty in proving something of which there may not be direct evidence may also arise at the stage of having to identify what the &#8216;something&#8217; was that was the real reason for the treatment, but it also often arises at the stage of considering whether there is a causal connection between the &#8216;something&#8217; and the disability. </p>

Or, to put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Igen v Wong </span>terms, the burden passes to the respondent to show that the treatment was &#8220;in no sense whatsoever&#8221; because of the protected characteristic as there, despite initial appearances, no material causal connection in the particular case.</p>

However, I have on further reflection since the hearing felt it necessary to make a Rule 14 Order of my own motion in order to protect B&#8217;s personal information. That necessitates anonymising her parents, but I do not consider that it requires the school to be anonymised. B is too young to understand this case at present, but I am mindful that this decision contains personal information about her that will, as a result of the publication of this judgment, potentially remain in the public domain indefinitely and which could have a significant impact on her in later life. It is not fair on B for this information to be publicly available indefinitely. Although it is important to public justice that parties are named, the public interest is nearly as well served in this case by the publication of this judgment without identifying B (or her parents). Anonymising B (and of necessity also her parents) strikes the right balance in this case between B&#8217;s private rights and the public interest. If either party, or any member of the public, objects to this order, they may apply to the Upper Tribunal and any application will be considered on notice to the parties.</p>
