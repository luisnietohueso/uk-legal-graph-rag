	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This appeal concerns the scope of the interim duty imposed on local authorities in Scotland by section 29(1) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 (&#8220;the 1987 Act&#8221;) and article 4(b) of the Homeless Persons (Unsuitable Accommodation) (Scotland) Order 2014 (SSI 2014/243) (&#8220;the 2014 Order&#8221;). It is not in doubt that section 29(1) imposes a mandatory duty on local authorities to secure accommodation on an interim basis that is not unsuitable within the meaning of the 2014 Order. The question is whether such accommodation will be unsuitable within the meaning of the 2014 Order unless it meets all the needs of the applicant and each member of the applicant&#8217;s household. The answer to that question depends on the meaning and effect of the phrase &#8220;taking into account the needs of the household&#8221; as it appears in article 4(b) of the 2014 Order. </p>

Their household also comprises four children, three daughters and a son, who has an autism diagnosis and special needs accordingly. A four-apartment property (three bedrooms and a living room) was secured by the respondent for them on an interim basis in February 2021. Their permanent accommodation needs were assessed in a report dated 21 July 2021 as a &#8220;five-apartment property in order to accommodate their son&#8217;s additional support needs &#8230;&#8221;. </p>

She succeeded in her claim for judicial review in the Outer House of the Court of Session before the Lord Ordinary, Lord Ericht who held at para 31 that &#8220;the respondent is under an absolute duty to provide temporary accommodation to the petitioner which is suitable for occupation by the petitioner&#8217;s household, taking into account the additional support needs of the petitioner&#8217;s son. To put it in another way, the respondent is under an absolute duty to provide a five-apartment property.&#8221; ([2022] CSOH 35; 2022 SLT 554). </p>

The Inner House held that, on a true construction of section 29 and article 4(b), the &#8220;test of &#8216;suitability&#8217; may be met even where the<span style="color:#000000"> temporary accommodation does not meet any special needs of individual members in all respects, so long as account is taken of the general needs of the household and the decision of the local authority in that regard is a reasonable one&#8221; (para 43). It reached that conclusion having regard to the &#8220;striking differences in the wording&#8221; of the statutory provisions which impose a duty to meet particular needs in relation to permanent accommodation, and those that relate to the suitability of temporary </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">accommodation (para 38); the absurdity which results from the construction of article 4(b) advanced by the appellant (para 40); and the incompatibility of the appellant&#8217;s position with the practical operation of the statutory scheme (para 41).</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant appeals from that decision, leave to appeal having been granted by the Supreme Court. The arguments are in essence as follows. Roddy Dunlop KC contends on the appellant&#8217;s behalf that, properly interpreted, section 29 and the 2014 Order together mean that the local authority&#8217;s interim duty is to secure accommodation which meets all the homeless applicant&#8217;s needs as well as the needs of the members of the applicant&#8217;s household residing with her. There is no distinction between general and special needs in this regard. Failure to meet all needs renders the accommodation unsuitable within the meaning of article 4(b) of the 2014 Order. The Inner House was therefore wrong to reverse the decision of the Lord Ordinary on this basis and was wrong to conclude that the four-apartment property secured for the appellant was suitable for her and her family accordingly. For the respondent, David Johnston KC contends that the interim duty in section 29 simply requires the local authority to consider the needs of a homeless applicant and all members of her household when securing suitable accommodation but does not extend to requiring the authority to secure accommodation which meets all the needs of each member of the household; that was the respondent&#8217;s approach here and it cannot be impugned.</p>

Section 24(2) provides that a person is treated as having no accommodation in the United Kingdom or elsewhere (and is therefore homeless under section 24(1)) if there is no accommodation which he, together with any other person who normally resides with him as a member of his family, is entitled to occupy.</p>

There is no dispute in this case, that the appellant was an unintentionally homeless applicant within the meaning of Part II of the 1987 Act and that an interim duty to secure accommodation was owed to her by the respondent.</p>

Registered social landlords will usually cooperate with Glasgow City Council in making both interim and permanent accommodation available. However, what Glasgow City Council receives is dependent on what registered social landlords have available.&#8221;</p>

That means that the permanent accommodation that is eventually secured must be a five-apartment house: four bedrooms and a living room. It is a five-apartment case due to the size and makeup of the family. It is also a five-apartment case because registered social landlords have policies stating that living rooms should not be used as sleeping accommodation. In this case we have a couple and four children who are ten years of age or over. Three of the children are girls and one a boy. The children are of an age where a maximum of two persons may share a room. The boy is of an age where it is considered inappropriate for him to share a room with a sister. Accordingly, there is a need for four rooms to be used as sleeping accommodation: one for [the appellant] and husband; one for two of the daughters; one for one daughter; and one for the son.</p>

The rules on overcrowding can be found at section 135 and 136 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. In these sections the definition of sleeping accommodation includes the living room. However, no registered social landlord will grant a tenancy on a permanent basis if it means the living room must regularly be used as sleeping accommodation. This is a policy decision by the RSLs. To my knowledge this policy has never been challenged by Glasgow City Council. </p>

Five apartment accommodation is generally occupied by permanent tenants and becomes available when someone passes away or moves. It can take a very long time to get an offer of five apartment accommodation, even longer if a person will not consider offers outwith specified areas. In respect of [the appellant&#8217;s] application, no five apartment houses have become available during the time of her application. I check this at intervals. Even if one did become available, it is by no means certain that it would be offered to [the appellant] as there will be families in similar circumstances who have earlier homelessness application dates. There are larger families who would need a five apartment as interim accommodation while waiting for an even scarcer six apartment. All this means that it could be many months or more than a year before a five-apartment house becomes available to [the appellant] and her family.</p>

The first stage involves the interim duty to provide temporary accommodation under section 29 and the second, the duty to provide permanent accommodation under section 31. The duty imposed on local authorities is a duty to secure that accommodation is available for occupation by the homeless person and at each stage, that accommodation must be suitable. But what is suitable to be secured pursuant to the interim duty is not necessarily the same as for the more open-ended permanent duty that arises under section 31.  </p>

The accommodation provided pursuant to section 29(1) is provided at a time when the local authority has reason to believe an applicant is homeless but has not yet decided that question; it is provided pending conclusion of the local authority&#8217;s inquiries under section 28 and if those inquiries result in a decision that the applicant is not intentionally homeless, until &#8220;permanent&#8221; accommodation becomes available: see section 29(1)(a) and (c). Section 31 then provides the definition of what is required by way of permanent accommodation. </p>

Secure in this context means that the local authority is responsible for ensuring that accommodation is available for occupation by the homeless applicant. Section 29(3) requires that the accommodation secured at this stage does not include accommodation described in the 2014 Order, in other words, accommodation that is unsuitable in the various respects identified by that Order. Article 4 applies &#8220;in all circumstances&#8221; where the interim duty applies. It describes accommodation that is, in all circumstances, unsuitable. Critically, for the purposes of this appeal, accommodation is unsuitable if the accommodation is not suitable for occupation by a homeless household, &#8220;taking into account the needs of the household&#8221;: see article 4(b). The assessment of suitability must therefore involve consideration of the needs of the homeless household, defined by article 2 as meaning &#8220;the applicant and any person who resides, or might reasonably be expected to reside, with the applicant&#8221;. </p>

The &#8220;needs&#8221; referred to in both cases are their needs as regards accommodation. These may be special or particular (for example, resulting from a protected characteristic such as disability or other medical or physical needs or vulnerability that affects a person&#8217;s ability to access the accommodation or the nature of the accommodation that will be suitable for them); or the needs may be general (for example, resulting from the number of members of the household or their ages). There is no warrant for any gloss on the word needs or the phrase the &#8220;needs of the household&#8221;. To the extent that the judgment of the Inner House has been read or understood as drawing a distinction between special, particular or general needs (whether of the household or of individuals living with the applicant), then that is wrong. Needs in this context means all relevant needs as regards accommodation, whether special or particular, general, medical or otherwise.

By section 29(3), interim accommodation cannot be provided if it is &#8220;not suitable&#8221; in terms of article 4(b) of the 2014 Order which requires that the assessment of suitability is done &#8220;taking into account&#8221; the needs of the household. By contrast, by sections 31 and 32(5), to be suitable permanent accommodation must &#8220;meet any special needs&#8221; of the applicant and the homeless household.  </p>

The first is a results or outcome driven duty and the second is a process duty requiring needs to be considered but not requiring them to be met. The distinction is one that is well recognised in other legislative schemes (see for example the duty to have &#8220;due regard&#8221; in section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 which does not dictate a particular outcome or result but is a duty on public bodies to consider &#8211; or have due regard for &#8211; the impact of certain equality considerations when exercising their functions). Where the legislation requires needs to be &#8220;taken into account&#8221; it does not introduce a requirement that must be met for the accommodation to be suitable. Rather, article 4(b) (and the other provisions of the 2014 Order referred to above) introduce a factor which must be taken into consideration when deciding whether or not the accommodation is suitable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The distinction is unsurprising given that the statutory scheme plainly envisages that a local authority will come under a duty to secure temporary accommodation under section 29 before a full needs assessment can take place (as happened here): see for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Dafaalla v City of Edinburgh Council </span>[2022] CSIH 30; [2022] SLT 807, paras 27 and 28. It is understandable in these circumstances <span style="color:#000000">that no obligation to achieve a particular outcome (by providing accommodation that meets needs) is imposed at the interim duty stage. On the other hand, the strikingly different language in sections 31 and 32(5) reflects the fact that, as might be expected, the obligation to secure permanent accommodation is more stringent and demanding: it must both </span><span style="font-style:italic">meet </span>any special needs of the homeless applicant or her household (section 32(5)(b)), and be &#8220;reasonable for the applicant to occupy&#8221; (section 32(5)(c)). <span style="color:#000000">If the appellant&#8217;s case were right the duties under sections 29 and 31would be co-extensive and the distinction drawn by the legislation would not be necessary. Moreover, it is precisely because the section 31 duty is more demanding that the local authority can notify another authority to perform the duty at the permanent stage &#8211; see sections 31(2) and 33 which allow for the section 31 duty to be referred to another local authority with which the homeless applicant has greater local connections </span>&#8211;<span style="color:#000000"> whereas the section 29 interim duty &#8220;arises irrespective of any local connection which an applicant may have with the district of another local authority&#8221; (section 29(2)) and cannot be so referred. </span></p>

It is unsurprising that the legislation should draw a distinction that has real substantive force in the context of local authority housing duties given the well-recognised background of constraints on housing and the scarcity of housing resources. Each of these two duties must be seen in the light of what can be done in the performance of the other. Accommodation provided under section 29 is a staging post along the way to permanent accommodation under section 31. Accordingly, as a matter of practical reality, there are likely to be cases where what is suitable for a homeless person to occupy on an interim basis while the authority completes its inquiries or looks for permanent accommodation, will be different to what is suitable in the longer term (see to similar effect in the context of housing duties owed to the homeless in Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 for England and Wales, <span style="font-style:italic">R (Aweys) v Birmingham City Council </span>[2009] UKHL 36; [2009] 1 WLR 1506 at para 47).

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The distinction between meeting needs and taking such needs into account is borne out by the language in other provisions of the 2014 Order. First, article 4 itself sets out certain irreducible minimum requirements that must always be met for accommodation to be suitable. In doing so, it uses different language to that used in article 4(b): see the requirement to <span style="font-style:italic">be</span> wind and watertight in article 4(a) and the requirement to <span style="font-style:italic">meet</span> minimum safety standards in article 4(c). Secondly, article 5 specifies certain additional suitability factors and by article 6, these can be derogated from in an emergency or other specified circumstances. The language used in the different subparagraphs of article 5 is significant. Article 5(c) is a requirement that must be met. By contrast, the requirements in articles 5(b) and 5(g) are both factors that must be taken into account, or considered, rather than met in order for suitability to be established. In other words, where the legislature intends the 2014 Order to provide that accommodation will be unsuitable unless it meets a certain requirement or need, it says so.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This is also consistent with the practical operation of the scheme. Whereas the requirements of article 5 can be disapplied if the applicant has become homeless because of an emergency (such as a flood, fire or other disaster) and the local authority can then discharge its duty under section 29 by securing accommodation that does not meet the requirements of article 5 (see article 6(a)), article 4 cannot be disapplied. The result on the appellant&#8217;s case would produce incoherence: on her case, if an applicant is made homeless by emergency flooding, the local authority could secure temporary accommodation which did not provide adequate toilet and personal washing facilities for the exclusive use of the household which met the accessibility needs of the household (article 5(c) having been disapplied by article 6(a)), but would nonetheless be required to secure accommodation that met all needs of the applicant and members of her household. Properly interpreted, to discharge its duty under section 29 a local authority must secure accommodation that meets the needs so specified in article 4(a), (c) and those in article 5 (for example, accessible toilet and washing facilities) assuming the requirements in article 5 have not been disapplied. As regards all other needs of members of the homeless household, the local authority&#8217;s obligation is to take them into account when deciding whether accommodation is suitable on a temporary basis. This analysis produces a coherent workable scheme.   </p>

Nor is there anything in the appellant&#8217;s argument that the scope of the duty under section 29 of the 1987 Act changes once the local authority has carried out an assessment of the homeless applicant&#8217;s permanent accommodation needs. There is nothing in the legislative provisions to support this and I agree with the respondent that it would, in any event, undermine the duty imposed on the local authority if its scope were determined by the actions (or inactions) of the person on whom the duty falls.</p>

It can be done by placing a statutory duty on the local authority to take into account the needs of the household as a factor relevant to whether temporary accommodation is suitable; or by placing a statutory duty on the local authority to provide temporary accommodation that meets the needs of the household. Both are equally compatible with the policy intention. Accordingly, neither the guidance nor the Policy Note sheds any light on the particular question that is in dispute between the parties in this case. These materials cannot determine the proper interpretation of the legislation &#8211; that is for the courts to do. The Inner House was amply entitled to prefer its own interpretation of the legislation in these circumstances and correct to focus (as it did) on the statutory provisions identifying the extent of the local authority&#8217;s accommodation duty at different stages of the developing process. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">At the interim duty stage, in assessing suitability, some of the household&#8217;s needs may not be met, but they must be &#8220;taken into account&#8221; (in other words, considered) in deciding whether the accommodation is suitable. Thus, for example, if a homeless household has a member with a known phobia of heights, a consequent need for ground floor accommodation would have to be taken into account in deciding whether accommodation on the upper floors of a high-rise building is suitable. Likewise, in identifying suitable accommodation for a household, the fact that it is comprised of, say, two adults and four teenage children (two boys and two girls with different needs) must be considered in assessing how many bedrooms are required. It is for the local authority, with its in-house expertise and experience, to assess the needs of the household in each case, whatever they might be. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The assessment of suitability under section 29 and article 4(b) is, of course, subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the court. The control is rationality. Provided the local authority reaches a decision that is within the range of reasonable decisions available, it will not be open to challenge because some needs have not been met. No doubt, it would be irrational to conclude that accommodation on the upper floors is suitable for the household in the first example, and irrational to consider that a small one-apartment property is suitable in the second example. If the decision maker were to leave out of account a relevant matter (material to the accommodation needs of the household) or reach an irrational decision, the applicant would have a remedy on judicial review. It is also the case that when the needs of the household are taken into account, temporary accommodation may be suitable for occupation by that household for a short period, but the point may come beyond which that accommodation ceases to be so and becomes unsuitable: see for example, <span style="font-style:italic">R (Imam) v Croydon London Borough Council </span>[2023] UKSC 45; [2025] AC 335 at para 38.</p>

Critically, the respondent took into account the need for sleeping accommodation in four rooms, so that the appellant&#8217;s son could have his own room (see paras 13, 19 and 26 of Mr Fulton&#8217;s affidavit); and the fact that the needs assessment by the occupational therapist, Ms Bickerstaff, in July 2021 recommended provision of five-apartment accommodation as permanent accommodation for the appellant&#8217;s family. As Mr Fulton explained, that recommendation confirmed his earlier view that permanent accommodation for this household would require five apartments, but in the absence of such a property being available immediately, four-apartment accommodation was the next best thing and was not unsuitable. A four-apartment flat has three bedrooms and a living room. Although this would not be possible on a permanent basis, the living room could be used on a temporary basis for the dual purpose of a living room by day and a bedroom by night, and this enabled the appellant&#8217;s son to have his own space and bedroom. This also met the requirement to provide a living room in article 5. </p>

The interim accommodation provided by the respondent satisfied the requirements of article 4 of the 2014 Order because the respondent took those needs into account in securing accommodation that was suitable for them. The need for a five-apartment property had to be considered but did not have to be met at the interim stage. The respondent duly fulfilled its duty under section 29 of the 1987 Act in these circumstances. </p>
