	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first issue in this appeal is whether the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (&#8220;GRA&#8221;) requires the issue of a Gender Recognition Certificate (&#8220;GRC&#8221;) recording an applicant&#8217;s gender as &#8220;non-binary&#8221;, where that designation has been acquired by the applicant under the law of a different state or territory outside the United Kingdom which is recognised in this jurisdiction under section 2(4) of the GRA.  If the answer is No, then a second issue arises:  whether that interpretation of the GRA is incompatible with Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (&#8220;ECHR&#8221;), when read with Article 8 (the right to respect for private life).  If that interpretation is incompatible with the ECHR, then a third issue arises, as to the appropriate remedy:  whether it is possible to give the GRA a compatible interpretation pursuant to the strong obligation of interpretation in section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 (&#8220;HRA&#8221;) or whether the Court should grant a declaration of incompatibility under section 4(2).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an appeal against the order of the Divisional Court (Elisabeth Laing LJ and Heather Williams J) dated 17 January 2024, dismissing a claim for judicial review lodged in the Administrative Court, and dismissing a statutory appeal lodged in the Family Court under section 8(1) of the GRA.  The claim for judicial review and the statutory appeal both challenged the decision of the Gender Recognition Panel (&#8220;GRP&#8221;) to refuse to issue a GRC to Ryan Castellucci (&#8220;the Appellant&#8221;), under section 4(1) of the GRA.</p>

However, the claimant does not identify as either male or female. They have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and have had different medical treatments, including hormone treatment and genital surgery.  On 23 June 2021 the claimant was recognised as non-binary by the state of California and, in accordance with the law of the state of California, their certificate of live birth was amended to change their sex to &#8216;non-binary&#8217;.  There is no indication on the document that it is not the original certificate or that the claimant&#8217;s sex was previously registered as male.  On 12 April 2022 the claimant was issued with an American passport which lists their sex as &#8216;X&#8217;.  The claimant uses &#8216;Mx&#8217; as their preferred title.</p>

After obtaining legal recognition of their non-binary status in the state of California, the claimant sought to have their gender recognised as non-binary in the United Kingdom through a GRC.  They completed a statutory declaration, witnessed by a notary public, on 21 February 2022, stating that they had transitioned in November 2019; they had lived as non-binary throughout the period of two years before the date of the statutory declaration; they intended to live in that gender until their death; they were ordinarily resident in England and Wales; and they were not currently married or in a civil partnership.  In April 2023 the claimant submitted the declaration with an application for a GRC to the GRP, using the appropriate prescribed form, T453.</p>

The claimant was asked whether they were happy for their gender to be recorded as &#8216;female&#8217; on the GRC. The claimant replied on 9 September 2022 saying that their gender was &#8216;non-binary&#8217;, as recognised by their birth certificate issued in the state of California, and that this should be printed on the GRC.  The claimant explained that they would not be happy to be certified as &#8216;female&#8217;, as this was not their gender.</p>

The claimant then asked for confirmation that a designation of &#8216;not specified&#8217; on a GRC would have the meaning of &#8216;a gender which cannot be classified as &#8220;female&#8221; or &#8220;male&#8221;&#8217;.</p>

			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.65in">&#8216;The situation is that I granted a GRC on the basis of your application having changed gender in California, where you were recognised as non-binary. California is on the list of those countries/states which are recognised by the UK in the context of applications from abroad.  In my legal judgment, that meant that I was able to grant your application, despite the fact that the UK does not itself operate a system which recognises a non-binary category.</p>

			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:0.65in">You have had the position regarding the UK categorisation explained to you. You ask, however, whether &#8216;not specified&#8217; when printed on a GRC has a meaning to the effect of &#8216;a gender which cannot be classified as &#8220;female&#8221; or &#8220;male&#8221;&#8217;. The answer to that is probably no, but I preface that remark with the observation that I am not able to give you legal advice. My answer is given because as the UK does not recognise a non-binary category I can think of no reason why there would be such a meaning.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Following pre-action correspondence, on 15 November 2022 the claimant issued three sets of proceedings: (1) an appeal in the Family Division, under section 8 of the GRA, against the GRP&#8217;s decision, in the 25 October 2022 letter, refusing to grant a GRC specifying their acquired gender as non-binary (&#8216;the Appeal&#8217;); (2) an application in the Administrative Court for judicial review of the 25 October 2022 decision (&#8216;the JR&#8217;); and (3) a Part 8 claim in the King&#8217;s Bench Division seeking a declaration that &#8216;not specified&#8217; on a GRC issued to the claimant under the overseas recognition route meant the same as &#8216;non-binary&#8217; (&#8216;the Part 8 Claim&#8217;).  The remedy sought in the Appeal was an order granting the claimant a GRC recording their gender as non-binary.  In the JR the claimant sought an order quashing the GRP&#8217;s decision and/or an order granting them a GRC specifying their gender as non-binary and/or a mandatory order requiring the GRP to provide a GRC to that effect.  Declaratory relief was also sought, including a declaration of incompatibility under the HRA, and damages under the HRA.&#8221;</p>

The appeal, which had been commenced in the Family Division, was transferred to the Divisional Court of the King&#8217;s Bench Division, which also heard the claim for judicial review.  The issues also became narrower and were in essence the issues which are now pursued in the appeal to this Court.</p>

In substance, it fell to the Minister for Women and Equalities to defend the proceedings and it is the Minister who has appeared before this Court to resist the appeal.</p>

In 2014 the claimant married a woman.  At that stage they took steps to pass as a man in the way they dressed and cut their hair.  In 2016 the claimant disclosed their gender status to their then wife.  They were divorced in June 2018.</p>

They changed the way that they dressed and then in January 2020 began laser hair removal.  As we mentioned earlier, the claimant had moved to London in December 2019, to join their partner, who had accepted a job in London.  The couple plan to settle in England for the long term.</p>

Their GP referred them to the gender identity clinic.  In the light of the waiting list, the claimant arranged appointments with private doctors.  Dr Vickie Pasterski diagnosed the claimant as having gender dysphoria. The second doctor provided a prescription for hormone replacement therapy (which the claimant has continued to take, adding, after their surgery, a low dose of testosterone and progesterone).</p>

In June 2022 they had a consultation with a surgeon who was based in San Francisco and could do this operation.  A date 14 months later was set for the surgery.  The surgery was then done in two stages.  On 13 September 2022 Dr Pasterski wrote a letter saying that the claimant&#8217;s gender is non-binary, that they have been living openly as non-binary since June 2020, that they have received appropriate medical care to transition from their birth gender to non-binary, and that these changes are likely to be permanent.</p>

They describe the process of changing their official documents in the United States.  First they obtained an &#8216;X&#8217; gender marker on their Washington state driver&#8217;s licence.

After receiving their updated birth certificate from the state of California, the claimant filed &#8216;change of circumstances&#8217; papers asking for a new Biometric Residence Permit (&#8216;BRP&#8217;).  The United Kingdom Government website indicates that a change of gender is one of the circumstances which requires an application for a new BRP.  Accordingly, the claimant was anxious to regularise the position, but they were told that no new BRP could be issued on the basis of the birth certificate issued by the state of California.  It was agreed to wait for their updated US passport.  When they received it, they had an exchange of correspondence with UK Visas &amp; Immigration (&#8216;UKVI&#8217;).  In short, UKVI indicated that the claimant had to choose either a male or a female gender.  The claimant asked them to accept &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">anything other than &#8216;M/male&#8217; </span>&#8217;. The new BRP lists their gender as &#8216;F&#8217; (for female).</p>

The claimant also refers to difficulties when they had to have a background security check in relation to a new job.  The form they had to complete only provided two options for gender and was accompanied by a warning that providing false information was a criminal offence.  They manually entered &#8216;X&#8217;, but the company doing the background check changed this to &#8216;female&#8217; without asking the claimant.</p>

They explain that they worry about possible difficulties if they apply for British citizenship, as they plan to do. They explain that it is very upsetting not to know how their gender would be recorded on their death certificate and to be in a situation of uncertainty in the United Kingdom, when their US documents clearly reflect their gender as non-binary.  They feel that they are being treated less favourably than if they were a transgender woman in two ways.  First, their true, legally acquired gender is not recognised in the United Kingdom, and they are required to opt for an incorrect binary gender identifier, whereas a transgender woman, whose acquired gender had been recognised under the law of the state of California, would have no difficulty in obtaining a GRC in their female gender. Secondly, as a result of the uncertainties described, the claimant does not know what gender the United Kingdom thinks that they are.&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Thompson says that even when gender-neutral language is used, legislation across the statute book assumes the existence of only two sexes and/or genders and in some cases makes sex- or gender-specific provision.  The Interpretation Act 1978, for example, provides that (unless the contrary intention appears) reference to the masculine include the feminine and vice versa. She says that there are currently no examples in UK legislation of a gender other than male or female.</p>

Regulation 7(1) and form 1 of Schedule 1 to the Registration of Births and Deaths Regulations 1987 (SI 1987/2088) prescribe the particulars to be registered, including the child&#8217;s sex.  The legislation does not prescribe how sex is to be decided.  Miss Thompson says that registrars rely on the test identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Corbett v Corbett (orse Ashley)</span> [1971] P 83 for deciding whether the parties to a marriage are male or female; that is to say a person&#8217;s sex should be determined by the application of a chromosomal, gonadal and genital tests, where these are congruent, ignoring any operative intervention.  She says that all children, even those who have variations in sex characteristics, are described as either a male or a female at birth.  </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Miss Thompson notes that entitlements or rights may differ depending upon a person&#8217;s sex, for example in relation to pensionable age; and that there are criminal offences that can be committed against persons of a particular sex, such as the offence in section 1 of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. She notes that legislation assumes that only a woman will give birth to, or be the mother of a child, including legislation relating to maternity rights.  Sex is also an important factor in the provision of a wide variety of public sector services: the prison estate is exclusively split into male and female accommodation; hospitals may have single sex wards; and local authorities may fund rape crisis centres and domestic abuse refuges that offer their services to females only.  She says that in so far as some government services recognise that some people may prefer not to be referred to as either male or female:  &#8216;This tends to be the exception rather than the rule and in no circumstance amounts to legal recognition.&#8217;  By way of example, the Department for Work and Pensions (&#8216;the DWP&#8217;) uses the title &#8216;Mx&#8217; if individuals ask for it, but this does not affect their entitlement to sex-specific benefits.&#8221;</p>

She explained that the state of California did not recognise non-binary genders at the time of the 2011 Order and did not do so until 2017.  Since the Divisional Court proceedings, the state of California has been removed from the relevant list by the Gender Recognition (Approved Countries and Territories and Saving Provision) Order 2024 (&#8220;the 2024 Order&#8221;).</p>

Our scoping exercise with departments recognised that sex and gender identifiers are intrinsic to systems that departments use to function and provide services to the public, and that any changes to this would be wide-reaching.  While departments recognised the importance of being better equipped to accommodate people who do not identify as either exclusively male or female, they were cautious about any changes coming in quickly, especially given the implications for security, safeguarding and wider impacts across training, staffing, resources etc.  Any changes would also require public consultation and a full legislative process through Parliament.</p>

For example, how should marriage law accommodate non-binary individuals, should they have access to women-only refuges, should they be treated as mothers, fathers or something else and should they be accommodated in a male or female prison &#8230; Parliament would also need to consider the devolution implications and the potential for different sexes and genders to exist legally in different parts of the UK.  These questions would require careful and detailed thought, as well as consultation, a legislative process and a strong evidence base, all of which are lacking.</p>

Further, if the claimant were to be issued with a GRC recording them as non-binary at this time, they are likely to face considerable issues and frustrations because, as demonstrated above, UK policy, legislation and public service systems are all binary and not set out to be able to recognise or cater for any type of third gender.  Instead the Government needs to take a considered approach that takes account of all of these issues in the round.  Any changes should be considered through the proper processes, including consultation with the public and determined by Parliament, and any decision on an issue with such broad implications cannot be considered in isolation.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

She accepts that the claimant&#8217;s experiences would have been distressing, but she notes that they were ultimately able to obtain a binary gender marker on their BRP in accordance with their preference between &#8216;M&#8217; and &#8216;F&#8217; (albeit that was not what they sought); that the claimant was able to obtain a driver&#8217;s licence with their preferred title and there is no gender marker explicitly on the driving licence card; and that the background check was completed successfully.  Miss Thompson explains that it would not be possible for the claimant to obtain British citizenship with a non-binary marker, because the law does not recognise a non-binary gender.  She acknowledges that this would cause the claimant concern.

Those of us who, whatever our occasional frustrations with the expectations of society or our own biology, are nevertheless quite secure in the gender identities with which we were born, can scarcely begin to understand how it must be to grow up in the wrong body and then to go through the long and complex process of adapting that body to match the real self. But it does not take much imagination to understand that this is a deeply personal and private matter; that a person who has undergone gender reassignment will need the whole world to recognise and relate to her or to him in the reassigned gender; and will want to keep to an absolute minimum any unwanted disclosure of the history. This is not only because other people can be insensitive and even cruel; the evidence is that transphobic incidents are increasing and that transgender people experience high levels of anxiety about this. It is also because of their deep need to live successfully and peacefully in their reassigned gender, something which non-transgender people can take for granted.&#8221;</p>

Furthermore, Parliament has provided that an order made under that delegated power must be approved by an affirmative resolution by both Houses of Parliament.  At the time of the present case, the relevant order was the 2011 Order, which had been approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.  This included the state of California in a schedule.  Although, since 9 April 2024, the state of California has been removed from the schedule in the 2024 Order, it is clear from the saving provision (Article 4 of that Order) that this change in the law does not apply to applications which had not been determined before the date that the Order came into force.  Accordingly, it is the 2011 Order that was and remains applicable to this case.</p>

This is the primary means by which Parliament has given effect to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in <span style="font-style:italic">Goodwin v United Kingdom </span>(2002) 35 EHRR 18 and the declaration of incompatibility made by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Bellinger v Bellinger </span>[2003] UKHL 21; [2003] 2 AC 467.  This provision was necessary in order to remedy the breach of the ECHR which existed in the law before the GRA was introduced in 2004.  I do not accept Mr Buttler&#8217;s suggestion that section 9(1) merely creates a mandatory relevant consideration, which a public authority must take into account.  Section 9(1) creates a legal status where a certificate has been issued and has the effect that, as a matter of law, a person&#8217;s gender becomes &#8220;for all purposes&#8221; the acquired gender.  True it is that this is &#8220;subject to&#8221; provisions made either in the GRA itself or in any other enactment or any subordinate legislation:  see section 9(3).  But, unless one of those statutory exceptions applies, the general position is as set out in section 9(1).  It is clear that, in using the words &#8220;the acquired gender&#8221; in section 9(1), Parliament had in mind the binary concept of either the male gender or the female gender.</p>

It is a fair presumption that Parliament's policy or intention is directed to that state of affairs.  Leaving aside cases of omission by inadvertence, this being not such a case, when a new state of affairs, or a fresh set of facts bearing on policy, comes into existence, the courts have to consider whether they fall within the Parliamentary intention.  They may be held to do so, if they fall within the same genus of facts as those to which the expressed policy has been formulated.  They may also be held to do so if there can be detected a clear purpose in the legislation which can only be fulfilled if the extension is made.  How liberally these principles may be applied must depend upon the nature of the enactment, and the strictness or otherwise of the words in which it has been expressed.  The courts should be less willing to extend expressed meanings if it is clear that the Act in question was designed to be restrictive or circumscribed in its operation rather than liberal or permissive.  They will be much less willing to do so where subject matter is different in kind or dimension from that for which the legislation was passed. In any event there is one course which the courts cannot take, under the law of this country; they cannot fill gaps; they cannot by asking the question &#8216;What would Parliament have done in this current case &#8211; not being one in contemplation &#8211; if the facts had been before it?&#8217; attempt themselves to supply the answer, if the answer is not to be found in the terms of the Act itself.</p>

It is dealing with a controversial subject involving moral and social judgments on which opinions strongly differ.  It is, if ever an Act was, one for interpreting in the spirit that only that which Parliament has authorised on a fair reading of the relevant sections should be held to be within it.  The new (post-1967) method of medical induction is clearly not just a fresh species or example of something already authorised.  The Act is not for &#8216;purposive&#8217; or &#8216;liberal&#8217; or &#8216;equitable&#8217; construction.  This is a case where the courts must hold that anything beyond the legislature&#8217;s fairly expressed authority should be left for Parliament&#8217;s fresh consideration.&#8221;</p>

She was able to change her name, but could not change various official records which described her as male.  She claimed that this was a breach of her rights protected by articles 8, 12, 13 and 14 of the ECHR.  The European Court of Human Rights (&#8216;the ECtHR&#8217;) held that articles 8 and 12 had been violated, and did not consider the article 14 claim.  The ECtHR analysed the claim as a claim that the United Kingdom had breached a positive obligation to respect the applicant&#8217;s private life by not giving legal recognition to her gender reassignment.</p>

She had gender reassignment treatment and surgery.  In 1981, she had a marriage ceremony with a man.  She petitioned for a declaration that the marriage had been and was valid.  The judge and the Court of Appeal dismissed the petition on the grounds that the words &#8216;male&#8217; and &#8216;female&#8217; in section 11(c) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (&#8216;the MCA&#8217;) were to be understood by reference to biological criteria, and the appellant was male by reference to those criteria.  She appealed and also asked for a declaration that section 11(c) of the MCA was incompatible with articles 8 and 12 of the ECHR.  The House of Lords held that &#8216;male&#8217; and &#8216;female&#8217; were to be given their ordinary meaning, and referred to a person&#8217;s biological sex at birth.  A person born in one sex could not later become a person of the opposite sex.  English law did not recognise a marriage between two people who were of the same biological sex at birth.  Any other conclusion would amount to a significant change in the law and would create anomalies and uncertainties because of a lack of objective criteria by which gender reassignment surgery could be assessed. Such a change would interfere with the traditional concept of marriage and give rise to sensitive and complex issues, so that it could only be made by Parliament.  The House of Lords made a declaration that section 11(c) of the MCA was incompatible with the appellant&#8217;s article 8 and article 12 rights.</p>

The focus of all the speeches was the situation of the appellant, and of others like her, who felt that their biological sex at birth did not match their feelings about their sex.  The members of the Appellate Committee used the word &#8216;transsexual&#8217; to describe such people.  The Appellate Committee also recognised that if, and to what extent, the position of transsexual people was to be recognised by changes in legislation was complicated and sensitive, that it should not be done piecemeal, and that it was a matter for Parliament.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Bellinger v Bellinger</span>, the House of Lords declared that section 11(c) of the MCA, which relied on a distinction between male and female, was incompatible with articles 8 and 10.  The making of that declaration triggered the power conferred by section 10(2) of the HRA 1998 to make an order remedying the incompatibility.  In the event, that power was not exercised. Instead, Parliament enacted the GRA.  Mr Buttler rightly accepted that the GRA was enacted as a response to <span style="font-style:italic">Goodwin</span> and to <span style="font-style:italic">Bellinger v Bellinger</span>.&#8221;</p>

Mr Buttler submits that, nevertheless, when used in the context of the foreign law route, the concept of &#8220;gender&#8221; includes the possibility of a non-binary status.  If Mr Buttler were correct, the effect would be that, silently and by a sidewind, Parliament introduced what would otherwise be a fundamental change to the law.  It could easily have done so expressly and, in my view, one would have expected it to do so, especially given the sensitive and potentially controversial nature of that change:  see the evidence of Miss Thompson, which I have summarised above.</p>

The decisions which he did cite did not concern the concept of non-binary gender.  For example Case-4/23 <span style="font-style:italic">Mirin </span>ECLI:EU:C:2024:845 concerned a binary gender certificate.  The claimant was a Romanian national born in Romania and registered female at birth.  The claimant moved to the UK and obtained a GRC  through the domestic route under section 1(1)(a) of the GRA, changing legal gender to male in 2020.  In 2021 the claimant requested the Romanian authorities to register this change in legal gender but the Romanian authorities rejected that request on the ground that under Romanian law a person must initiate new judicial proceedings in Romania to seek authorisation of the gender identity change.  The Court of Justice found that this was a breach of the right to free movement, contrary to Article 20 and Article 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  </p>

It concerned a same-sex couple who gave birth to their child in Spain and were both listed as the parents in Spanish law.  When they moved to Bulgaria they were refused a birth certificate for their child on the ground that Bulgarian law did not recognise same-sex marriages.

To the contrary, it might be said to provide an example of the kind of legislation which one would expect to see in this jurisdiction if effect is to be given to a concept like non-binary status, where it is recognised by a responsible authority in a foreign jurisdiction (here California) but not recognised by domestic law.  The Maltese legislature was clearly alive to that possibility and has expressly provided for it even in circumstances where a gender marker is not recognised by the Maltese Act itself:  that simply illustrates the fundamental point made by Sir James Eadie on behalf of the Respondent, that the issue is one for the UK Parliament to consider, and to change the law if that is thought to be desirable.  It certainly does not assist Mr Buttler in the submission he makes as to the correct interpretation of the current law in this country.</p>

He accepts in the context of these proceedings that he is precluded from making such an argument.  This is relevant not only because he has withdrawn his argument under Article 8 but because, under Article 14, he does not and cannot argue that the failure of domestic law to recognise a non-binary gender is incompatible with the ECHR.  That difference in treatment is not therefore one which the UK is required to justify as being proportionate under Article 14.  Rather Mr Buttler complains that the interpretation given to the GRA by the Divisional Court, if upheld by this Court, gives rise to a disproportionate and unjustified discrimination as between two persons who have changed gender under the law of a foreign country or territory.  If they acquire a binary status (male or female), the GRA will lead to that status being recognised and given effect in the UK as well.  In contrast, if (like this Appellant) they have acquired a non-binary status, that will not be given effect in the UK.</p>

The two aspects of the justification which weighed with the Supreme Court in that case which would be equally applicable to the present context are, first, the coherence of the legal and administrative system in the UK; and, secondly, the cost which would be incurred by the state in having to change the current system.  I therefore turn to the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Elan-Cane </span>in more detail.</p>

The claimant, who had been born with female physical sexual characteristics but identified as having no gender, wished to have an &#8220;X&#8221; marker in their passport.  The claim was brought under both Article 8 of the ECHR and Article 14.  The judgment was given by Lord Reed PSC, with whom the other members of the Supreme Court agreed.</p>

He said that there had been no judgment of the European Court of Human Rights which established such a positive obligation but that the European Court had generally analysed cases concerned with gender identity &#8220;from the perspective of whether the respondent state has failed to comply with its positive obligation to secure to the persons concerned their right to respect for private life under Article 8&#8221;, citing, for example, the Grand Chamber judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">H&#228;m&#228;l&#228;inen v Finland </span>(2014) 37 BHRC 55, at paras 64-67.  </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">As was explained in evidence, there is no legislation in the United Kingdom which recognises a non-gendered category of individuals.  On the contrary, legislation across the statute book assumes that all individuals can be categorised as belonging to one of two sexes or genders (terms which have been used interchangeably).  Some rights differ according to whether a person is a man or a woman: for example, rights of succession to hereditary titles.  There are criminal offences that can only be committed against persons of a particular gender: for example, female genital mutilation.  There is a raft of legislation which assumes that only a woman can give birth to, or be the mother of, a child, including legislation relating to maternity rights and benefits, health provision and fertility treatment, and nationality.  The legislation governing the registration of births requires the sex of children to be recorded.  Legislation relating to marriage and civil partnership (including legislation permitting same sex marriages) assumes that everyone is either a man or a woman. <span style="font-weight:bold">The Gender Recognition Act 2004, enacted following the judgment of the European court in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Goodwin v United Kingdom</span><span style="font-weight:bold">, likewise assumes that all individuals belong to one of two genders, albeit not necessarily the gender recorded at birth</span>. Equality legislation protects people from discrimination if it arises from their being a man or a woman.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">A binary approach to gender also forms the basis of the provision of a wide variety of public services.  The prison estate, for example, is divided into male and female prisons. Hospitals have wards where patients can only be of a single sex.  Local authorities may fund rape crisis centres or domestic abuse refuges which o&#8250;er their services only to women.  Many schools only admit pupils of a particular sex.  Much of this is underpinned by, or permitted by, legislation.</p>

Counsel for the appellant argued that the courts below had erred in treating the coherent treatment of individuals in the appellant&#8217;s position as a significant consideration.  On the contrary, the courts were right to conclude that the need for a legally and administratively coherent system for the recognition of gender was an important factor.&#8221;  (Emphasis added)</p>

At para 58, he emphasised that:</p>

They do not, on the other hand, possess the capacity, the resources, or the democratic credentials to be well-suited to social policy-making.  When adjudication by the European court requires it to consider questions of social policy, it accordingly finds guidance in a consensus on the part of the contracting states, and is cautious before embarking on such policy-making in the absence of a consensus.&#8221;</p>

The consequence of his submission would be to require the UK to recognise a non-binary status in domestic law (albeit only in cases coming through the foreign law route) in circumstances in which it is not otherwise required to do so by the ECHR.  Recognising that non-binary status in domestic law would have the consequences for other parts of the legal and administrative system to which the Supreme Court drew attention in <span style="font-style:italic">Elan-Cane</span> and which Miss Thompson sets out in her evidence in these proceedings.  It would also have cost implications.  Accordingly, the Respondent has shown that there is an objective justification for the difference in treatment about which Mr Buttler complains and the principle of proportionality is satisfied.</p>

I do not accept that this Court could give the GRA an interpretation of the kind which the Appellant would require, even pursuant to the strong obligation in section 3(1) of the HRA.  This would go &#8220;against the grain&#8221; of the GRA and would be inconsistent with &#8220;a fundamental feature&#8221; of it:  see <span style="font-style:italic">Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza</span> [2004] UKHL 30; [2004] 2 AC 557, for example at para 33 (Lord Nicholls).</p>
