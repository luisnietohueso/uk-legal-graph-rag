This morning, they filed a notice that the mother would be acting in person. She had made an application for legal aid on 7 February 2025.  Duncan Lewis were informed by the Legal Aid Agency (&#8216;LAA&#8217;) at just after 7 am this morning that the application had been refused. The refusal appears to have been on the basis of the &#8216;merits&#8217; of the mother&#8217;s case as opposed to her means.</span></p>

On 20 September 2024 the mother removed A from Poland and brought him to England without the knowledge or consent of the father. The father responded by making an application under the 1980 Hague Convention for A to be returned to Poland. This was issued in the High Court on 15 October 2024. More than 19 weeks have elapsed since then, over three times the six-week target length for proceedings enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention.</span></p>

The mother opposes the father&#8217;s application on the basis of Article 13(b), asserting that there is a grave risk that A&#8217;s return would expose him to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">We thus have a situation where the father, without any assessment of his finances or the merits of his case, has been provided with legal aid by the State to bring proceedings against the mother. This has enabled him to secure representation from solicitors and counsel who are specialists in international family law. By contrast, the mother has been left to fend for herself. It is difficult for any litigant to represent themselves, but even more so when they are facing an application where the law is highly complex and in circumstances where English is not their first language.</span></p>

The single joint expert, Dr Kolkiewicz, an eminent consultant psychiatrist, has identified that she is suffering from &#8216;a Mild Depressive Episode&#8217;. The mother completed a PHQ9 questionnaire and gave answers which, in the opinion of Dr Kolkiewicz, &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">reflect the understandable emotional distress she is currently experiencing as a direct response to the impending court proceedings</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Upon reading the papers, I came to the preliminary view &#8211; I emphasise, without hearing argument - that the mother may find it difficult to resist a return on the basis of Article 13(b), on the assumption that adequate protective measures are in place. To that extent, I can understand why the LAA may have assessed her case as lacking sufficient merit.  As any judge knows, however, the outcome a case can turn out very differently from what appears likely at first glance. It is, moreover, wrong in my view for the merits of a respondent&#8217;s position in 1980 Hague Convention proceedings to be assessed in purely binary terms of whether a return can be resisted or not.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In the majority of cases where a respondent relies solely upon Article 13(b), the outcome is that an order for return is made. Before making a return order, however, the court needs to be satisfied that there exist adequate protective measures to ensure that any potential risks to the child are sufficiently mitigated so as to ensure that the return will not give rise to the grave risk contemplated by Article 13(b). Additionally, the court has jurisdiction to determine the manner by which any return should take place and may be required to consider what are sometimes referred to as &#8216;soft landing&#8217; provisions, intended to limit the distress and disruption to the child which a sudden requirement to move to another jurisdiction will often create.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The detailed mechanics of a child&#8217;s return should not be regarded as a peripheral matter.  On the contrary, in a jurisdiction where the court is mandated to treat the interests of the child as a primary consideration, they are of crucial importance to the smooth operation of the 1980 Hague Convention.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Thus, even in cases where it may seem inevitable to a judge or to a case worker at the LAA that a respondent&#8217;s ultimate position in the proceedings may lack merit in the sense that they are unlikely to be able to resist a return, in my judgment legal representatives have a vital role to fulfil in arguing their client&#8217;s case as to the adequacy of proposed protective measures and steps that may need to be taken in the overseas jurisdiction before any return order is implemented. Given the complex nature of international family law, it may be very difficult for a lay person adequately to represent themselves in this type of case, let alone a litigant for whom English is not their first language and for whom &#8211; as consequence of the abuse they are alleged to have experienced &#8211; the proper articulation of their case may present real difficulties. One matter of particular difficulty which faces the mother in this case is whether to return to Poland with the child, in the event that a return order is ordered. She has an older child who lives in this jurisdiction.</span></p>

This is so, despite the imperative requirement in Convention proceedings to ensure that, as part of the court&#8217;s determination, the child who is the subject of the proceedings is adequately safeguarded from any risks arising from the allegations of abuse.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In this case, the decision of the LAA to refuse the mother legal aid on the merits has placed the court in an invidious position. Her former solicitors have communicated to the court that she has 14 days to appeal the decision and that they believe there would be merit in such an appeal. Whether or not that is so, I am not in a position to say.</span></p>

She has said that her former solicitors did not make it clear to her that she has a right to challenge the report and that she did not appreciate that this was the case until yesterday when she was preparing to come to court today.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The dilemma I face can be shortly stated. In order to achieve a gold standard of fairness, the mother should be represented. On the other hand, if I adjourn the case there is no guarantee that this will occur. The LAA, on any appeal, may simply reaffirm the decision it has already made, in which case the mother&#8217;s only remedy would be to pursue a judicial review of their decision &#8211; which is likely to be a lengthy process. Mr Shama therefore makes the point that granting an adjournment will simply defer the problem which exists today &#8216;down the road&#8217;.</span></p>

This principle is enshrined in section 1(2) of the Children Act 1989; although I am not concerned with proceedings under that Act it seems to me that it is a principle of universal application whenever the interests of a child are engaged even if, as here, they are not the court&#8217;s paramount consideration.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">It is widely acknowledged that delay can be particularly serious in 1980 Hague Convention proceedings. The very object of the proceedings is to achieve the prompt return of a child to the country of habitual residence to enable long-term welfare decisions to be made by the courts of that jurisdiction. For so long as the proceedings remain unresolved, the child is left in limbo, his parents living in a state of uncertainty as whether he will be returned or not. Proceedings are stressful for all concerned, but perhaps especially so for the taking parent who is facing the prospect of an unwelcome return to a country from which, in their perception, they may have escaped. That strain is likely to be communicated to the child in their care.</span></p>

There is certainly no entitlement for a party to require an expert witness to be cross-examined. Having considered the content of Dr Kolkiewicz&#8217;s report, I find it difficult to conceive how the mother could realistically have advanced her case through cross-examination. The professional assessment of the psychiatrist was that the mother fell a long way short of establishing that she would come within the type of exceptional case where the effect of a return on the mental health of the taking parent will give rise to an Article 13(b) situation. Accordingly, I do not consider the mother&#8217;s inability to cross-examine Dr Kolkiewicz at this hearing to be a valid reason for an adjournment.</span></p>

The mother&#8217;s explanation for the application only having been made on 7 February 2025 was that she did not appreciate that it would take several weeks for her application to be determined and that her solicitors did not chase her to provide the information necessary to advance the application. In circumstances where she was represented by experienced legal aid solicitors, I find this proposition difficult to accept.

I do not know what representations were made on her behalf to the LAA, but in circumstances where her former solicitor has informed the court that there is merit in her proposed appeal of the LAA&#8217;s decision, it seems to me that the mother will have had at least reasonable expectation that she would secure representation for this hearing.</span></p>

During the course of submissions, the mother made clear to me that there was no reason why A could not stay in Poland with his father for a period in addition to having regular indirect contact and direct contact in England. I propose to direct this. The independent evidence all suggests that A has a close relationship with both of his parents. The father, as much as the mother, has been greatly involved in his day to day care and the Polish court determined that it was in A&#8217;s interests for there to be a shared care regime in place between the parents. </span></p>

In circumstances where I have determined that the mother should be granted an adjournment despite the fact that &#8211; upon a consideration of virtually the totality of the evidence which will be before the trial judge - I consider she is unlikely to be able to resist a return order, it is appropriate in my view that in the interim A should be able to spent time with his father in Poland.  I will hear further submissions as to any safeguards which should be in place to enable the trip to happen.</span></p>
