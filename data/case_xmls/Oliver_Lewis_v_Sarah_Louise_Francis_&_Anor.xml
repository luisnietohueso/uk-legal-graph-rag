My main judgment, allowing the appeal by case stated, is on the National Archives under the citation [2025] EWHC 17 (Admin).  This supplemental judgment relates to the costs of the appeal and should be read together with the main judgment.  The appellant applies for assessed costs of the appeal, calculated at &#163;8,449.90.  The respondent resists the application and argues that the court should make no order as to the costs of the appeal.</p>

I did not think it right for the state to have to pay for obtaining that evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appellant pointed out that, while he was unrepresented below, the respondent was represented below by a solicitor and chose to make the costs application based on unnecessary or improper conduct, which generated the error by the District Judge.  The appellant could not, said Mr McCracken KC, have secured the variation to the costs order, wrongly made below, without incurring the costs he has incurred in the appeal, which are reasonable.  The arguments in the appeal were complex and difficult.</p>

The respondent did not, even in the alternative, apply to the District Judge for the respondents&#8217; costs from central funds under section 16 of the POA 1985.  They chose to rely exclusively on section 19.  During the appeal process, they were warned in open email correspondence about their risk of costs in the appeal, having told the appellant his appeal was &#8220;misconceived&#8221;.</p>

The circumstances here are truly exceptional.  The appeal is against an order made below in respect of costs, not as to the substance of the proceedings below.  Unless the civil regime applies, the appellant cannot recover any costs of the appeal.  He cannot recover any costs under the criminal regime because the proceedings below did not lead to a conviction.  Had there been a conviction and had he been represented below, the appellant would have recovered costs as of right under section 82(12) of the EPA 1990.</p>

The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Lord Howard</span>&#8217;s case flowed from a deliberate decision of parliament in legislation to deprive a successful defendant of his legal costs on appeal.  The present case is different; it involves an unsuccessful prosecution below, visited with a wrong adverse costs order below; which, if not challengeable on appeal without incurring irrecoverable costs on appeal, is not effectively challengeable on appeal at all.</p>

He referred to Strasbourg decisions cited in <span style="font-style:italic">Coventry v UK</span> (6016/16) at [59]; which, he submitted, &#8220;demonstrate that financial burdens on successful parties at the conclusion of proceedings may deprive people of their rights under ECHR A6 to a fair trial with equality of arms.&#8221;  If necessary, a question should be formulated for the Supreme Court, questioning the correctness of the <span style="font-style:italic">Lord Howard</span> line of authorities.</p>

The criminal costs regime should apply in the normal way and the POA 1985 afforded no basis for any order as to costs.  The appellant cannot and does not dispute that the appeal is a criminal cause or matter.  The Court of Appeal so held on appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Darroch</span>, at [21]-[22].  The reasons for applying the civil regime instead would have to be &#8220;compelling&#8221; (Linden J at [35] in the <span style="font-style:italic">Uxbridge Youth Court</span> case).</p>

The present appeal bears no resemblance to the facts in <span style="font-style:italic">Murphy</span>, where a process akin to substantial civil litigation had been followed.  That was, Ms Salmon submitted, &#8220;more akin to civil proceedings&#8221;.  This appeal is not.

It is not for the court to fill any lacuna in the legislation.  The court&#8217;s task is to apply the rules as they are.  It is true that the situation in the current appeal is not covered expressly in the legislative scheme.  That means the default rules of the criminal regime apply, as they did in <span style="font-style:italic">Lord Howard</span>, where the appellant had to live with his sense of injustice because parliament had made a deliberate decision on the issue.</p>

The respondents did not make the impugned decision; the District Judge did.  The offer to settle, if it could be properly accepted at all, was on terms less favourable than the outcome of the appeal for the respondents: they had preserved most of their costs award, albeit from a different source, i.e. central funds rather than the appellant.</p>

The human rights claim in <span style="font-style:italic">Coventry v.

The higher costs incurred by the respondents are irrelevant.  The issue arose because the appellant chose to bring a case so weak that the respondents did not have to answer it.  The case stated was not of the respondents&#8217; making.  The respondents had partially succeeded in the appeal.  They queried whether the appeal needed a silk; they should not have to pay for pre-trial work, in particular, preparing the initial case stated and any threat of judicial review of the magistrates&#8217; court&#8217;s decision.</p>

The issue of exceptionality is, as Ms Salmon rightly accepts, fact sensitive.  The situation here is unlike that in any of the other cases cited to me.  What is exceptional here is a combination of features which, taken together, mean the appellant&#8217;s right of appeal in this very case would be devoid of any value and useless if the criminal costs regime were applied.</p>

Those features together produce the result that the appellant must, if he is to appeal, fund the appeal, with a sum roughly equivalent to the amount of costs in issue in the appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is obvious, therefore, that an appellant embarking on this appeal without any possibility of costs recovery in the event of success, would in practice be throwing good money after bad.  At most, he could achieve a Pyrrhic victory or a victory of principle.  That is not enough to ease the conscience of the court.  It is a set of circumstances <span style="font-style:italic">par excellence</span> suitable for application of the <span style="font-style:italic">Murphy</span> exception.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This reasoning is not at odds with the statutory scheme.  Section 51 of the 1981 Act is a generic provision dealing with costs in the civil courts generally.  Section 51(5) makes clear that section 51(1) shall not alter the &#8220;practice&#8221; in any &#8220;criminal cause&#8221;.  The &#8220;practice&#8221; refers to the criminal costs regime in the POA 1985 and elsewhere and in case law.  But section 51(1) conferring general discretion on matters of costs is subject to section 28A, which specifically addresses costs in appeals by case stated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Section 28A applies to appeals by case stated from a magistrates&#8217; court or from the Crown Court.  It applies to this appeal.  Apart from determining the substantive issues in the appeal, the court is empowered by section 28A(3) to &#8220;make such other order &#8230; (including as to costs) as it thinks fit&#8221;.  I can exercise that power by applying the <span style="font-style:italic">Murphy</span> exception if the circumstances justify me doing so.  I am not violating section 51(5) by doing so.  The &#8220;practice&#8221; as to costs in a criminal cause does not include cases where the court, exceptionally, applies the civil regime instead.</p>

The discretion is the familiar one exercised in accordance with rule 44 of the CPR.  There is no doubt who is, in substance, the successful party.

I accept Ms Salmon&#8217;s submission that the respondents achieved a better outcome in the appeal than was offered.  If they had accepted the offer, they would have received no money from central funds.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I consider the discretion as to costs, in the usual way, through the lens of CPR rule 44.2.  The costs of the appeal were incurred mainly in consequence of two actions.  The first was the appellant bringing the prosecution for statutory nuisance.  That led to the acquittal of the respondents when their submission of no case was upheld.  There was no legal error or impropriety in that process, as I have decided in the main judgment.  An acquittal or acceptance of a submission of no case does not entail legal error.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second action was the respondents applying for costs on the ground of an unnecessary act, bringing the proceedings.  They were legally represented.  They chose to apply under section 19 of the POA 1985 and did not, as an alternative, apply for costs from central funds under section 16.  I can find no evidence that the District Judge was invited to consider or did consider making an award from central funds; although, as I said in the main judgment, I do not doubt that he was aware of the power to do so.</p>

Moreover, as legally represented parties, their solicitors were under the usual duties to their unrepresented opponent: to alert the court to authority adverse to their case and not to take unfair advantage of the opponent&#8217;s lack of representation.</p>

The District Judge was referred to no case law.  It would have been sufficient for the respondents to have taken him to the six propositions of Coulson J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Cornish</span>, cited in my main judgment at [52].
