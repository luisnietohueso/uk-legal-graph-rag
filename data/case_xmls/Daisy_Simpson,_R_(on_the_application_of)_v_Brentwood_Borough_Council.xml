The accommodation is on an assisted living estate.  The question in this case centres, on the Claimant&#8217;s case, on the performance of the Defendant&#8217;s duties under the Housing Act 1996 (hereafter &#8220;the 1996 Act&#8221;) Part VI concerning &#8216;Allocation of Housing Accommodation&#8221; and, on the Defendant&#8217;s case, its duties under Part VII of the 1996 Act concerning &#8216;Homelessness&#8217;. </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;The summary which I set out below was commended to me by Mr Burton KC and Mr Baldwin. It originates from a review which the Defendant conducted in September 2023. It was included within the Defendant's care plan dated 12.4.24 ("the Plan"). A "portacath" is a small piece of medical equipment that can make receiving frequent doses of intravenous (IV) therapy over a long period easier for healthcare professionals and more comfortable for patients. BIPAP is a form of non-invasive ventilation.</p>

		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.59in">&#8216;Daisy is a 35-year-old lady that lives alone in a one bedroomed flat in Brentwood. She is currently in receipt of a personal health budget with which she employs carers over a 24-hour period. Daisy has a long history of mental health disorders diagnosed at the age of 17 and numerous physical health conditions including Diabetes, Gastro issues, Gynae issues, Chronic Lung Condition, Moya Moya disease, Recurrent Trans Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) and Sleep Apnoea.</p>

		  <subparagraph>
		    <content>
		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.59in">Daisy has multiple interventions to support her breathing including BIPAP, Nebulisers six times daily, a four weekly intravenous infusion, a flutter device (a type of cough assist) and oral medications. Her fluctuating physical abilities mean that she often struggles to manage these interventions without support from her carer. Her carer also prepares all meals for Daisy and when she is present will also serve them to her. Daisy reports that she experiences intermittent swallowing problems especially following a TIA. Currently Daisy can access the toilet to pass urine and open her bowels however, she suffers from both incomplete emptying, requiring intermittent self-catheterisation at least once daily, and bowel dysmotility causing her issues with constipation that did require self-administration of enemas, however, this now appears to be managed with administration of Bisacodyl oral tablets. Daisy is at risk of skin deterioration due to her reduced mobility and as a side effect of oral steroids. She requires assistance from her carer to maintain her skin integrity. She has pro shield barrier cream applied at least twice daily. Daisy has a history of having suffered a stroke leaving her with left sided weakness. She is, however, still able to weight bear using pivot transfers although she stated that this is becoming more difficult each time, she has a further TIA. Currently Daisy requires the assistance of one to two people to assist her with the transfers. No falls have been recorded. Daisy has an electric wheelchair which she can drive herself once she has been assisted into position. Currently this is only used for outside purposes as her home is reported to be too small for wheelchair use.</p>

		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.59in">Daisy can verbally communicate clearly and articulately although she can intermittently suffer with mumbled speech especially after a TIA. Currently Daisy is orientated to time, place and person and has good insight into her impairments however, her memory is reported to have been worsening of late to the extent that she now requires prompting with all day-to-day activities. Daisy denies any challenging behaviour and states that she will only say no to something if she feels that she is being put at risk.</p>

		    <content>
		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.59in">Daisy has a complex medication regime which she currently manages herself with assistance from her carer although she stated that she is finding this more difficult. She has purchased an Insulin Pump and a constant glucose monitor to manage her diabetes. She requires assistance from her carer to fill and set up the pump and from her carer to enter carbohydrate amounts and blood sugar readings into the pump for it to calculate bolus doses. Daisy is prescribed Codeine to manage her pain however, she reports that this is ineffective, and she suffers constant pain. Oramorph is prescribed for breakthrough pain relief and Daisy can request this from her carer when needed. Daisy has also recently been diagnosed with Endometriosis which causes her to have heavy bleeding from her vagina. She requires assistance from her carer to manage this at times. Daisy is extremely difficult to cannulate and has now had a portacath inserted for easy vein access.</p>

		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.59in">Daisy suffered a stroke in 2021 and has been diagnosed with Moya Moya disease which limits the flow of blood to her brain and puts her at risk of further strokes. Daisy stated that currently she is having TIAs daily which temporarily affect her speech, mobility, and cognition. Daisy has multiple conditions affecting her daily life &#8230;: Moya Moya disease (under the Bristol, awaiting cerebral vascular bypass operation); Admissions to Queens with stroke and sub-arachnoid haemorrhage; Brittle asthma (under Brompton Hospital); Obstructive sleep apnoea (BIPAP) (under the Brompton); Diabetes Mellitus (presumed type 1, insulin treated, supported by the diabetic nurses); Recurrent episodes of elevated lactate levels (uncertain cause); Schizoaffective disorder; Migraines; Cushing's syndrome from previous long term steroid use. Presumed adrenal suppression due to long term high dose oral therapeutic steroid use; Progressive multiple fatty lumps; Emotional Unstable Personality Disorder. Daisy is known to multiple services including: Neurosurgeon; Respiratory physician; Gynaecologist; Ophthalmologist; Consultant neurologist - Dr De Silva; Dermatology; Diabetes and Endocrinology - Basildon and Thurrock Hospital; Occupational Therapy for support and equipment.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

The Defendant further accepts that the Claimant&#8217;s mobility is severely impaired and that she requires a wheelchair and physical assistance inside any premises for transfers to her bed and to sanitary facilities.

There is no hoist at Railway Square and nor can one be installed at that property.  The Claimant is, accordingly, subject to manual handling at her current property.  On 16 August 2021, Adult Social Care provided a Housing Needs Report in circumstances where her accommodation at Railway Square was becoming unsuitable on account of her medical conditions.  The report identified the Claimant as needing to be rehoused on an urgent basis into an adapted property.   On 28 August 2021, the Claimant applied to the Defendant for a transfer.  That application was supported by an Occupational Therapist report of Ms Bharma that recommended that (a) the Claimant be rehoused in a two bedroom fully accessible ground floor flat or bungalow and (b) that bathroom adaptations would need to be considered once the Claimant had been rehoused. </p>

The property required significant adaptation to be suitable for the Claimant, including the construction of an extension.  The Defendant confirmed that it would fund the works and a secure tenancy agreement was signed between the Defendant and the Claimant on 1 November 2022.</p>

On 30 August 2023, the Defendant sent a letter to the Claimant withdrawing the offer of Fairfield Road. The reason given for the withdrawal was that Fairfield Road was not suitable for meeting the Claimant&#8217;s needs as it could not be made habitable. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An alternative property was identified by the Defendant and the details of that property provided to the Claimant in the form of Rowan Green East, the accommodation on an assisted living estate, which had been surveyed and deemed suitable for adaptation.  It was said that it could be adapted quickly and was significantly larger than Fairfield Close.  By a letter dated 5 October 2023, the Defendant offered the Claimant Rowan Green East as permanent accommodation with a secure tenancy as part of its Allocation Scheme under Part VI of the 1996 Act. The Defendant invited the Claimant to view the property in October 2023 but the Claimant stated that she would only do so if no one from the Defendant was present.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Subsequently, the Claimant&#8217;s health further deteriorated.  Within this context, on 4 January 2024 the Defendant made a further offer of Rowan Green East to the Claimant as temporary suitable accommodation.  The Defendant contends that this offer was made pursuant to its duties under Part VII of the 1996 Act.  The Claimant accepts that this further offer of Rowan Green East was neither an offer of a secure tenancy nor an introductory tenancy.  The offer expressly stated that the accommodation was offered as temporary accommodation.  The offer of 4 January 2024 is the decision that the Claimant now seeks to challenge by way of her application for permission to apply for judicial review.  The letter setting out the Defendant&#8217;s decision of 4 January 2024 states as follows:</p>

If it is determined that Rowan Green is not suitable the Council will look for other accommodation. If it is determined that Rowan Green is suitable for you the Council, will offer you a secure tenancy of that property. For the avoidance of doubt the determination of whether Rowan Green is suitable will be based on the medical and expert evidence. The purpose of the temporary offer of the Rowan Green property is so that you can move as soon as possible from Railway Square, which is certainly not suitable for you and in respect of which the Rowan Green property is, on any view, an improvement.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By Ground 2 the Claimant contends that the decision of the Defendant that Rowan Green East is suitable accommodation is in breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Tameside</span> Duty and the Public Sector Equality Duty.  In the context of the court&#8217;s conclusion in respect of Ground 1, it follows that Ground 2 is not an arguable ground for judicial review having a realistic prospect of success. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a statutory right under s.202 of the 1996 Act to request a review of suitability of the accommodation offered under Part VII of the 1996 Act 1996 and a further right of statutory appeal on a point of law under s.204.  A challenge to an LHA&#8217;s decision that accommodation offered in performance of its duty is suitable is therefore by way of a request for a review under s.202 of the 1996 Act and thereafter by a statutory appeal under s. 204 of that Act.  No such review has been requested or appeal pursued and determined.  It would not be appropriate to grant the Claimant permission to pursue Ground 2 by way of judicial review.</p>

In the context of the court&#8217;s conclusion in respect of Ground 1, it follows that Ground 3 is not an arguable ground for judicial review having a realistic prospect of success.</p>

The terms of the decision made on 4 January 2024 were likewise plain and clearly did not fall within Part VI of the 1996 Act.  That position was made clear by the Defendant repeatedly from at least July 2024.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Claimant&#8217;s claim is totally without merit.</p>
