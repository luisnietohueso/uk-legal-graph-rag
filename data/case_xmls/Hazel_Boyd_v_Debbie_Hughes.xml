The Defendant&#8217;s premises included a horse-shoe shaped gallop with a carpet fibre surface that was about 4 furlongs (880 yards) in length, and a round; gallop of a similar length and constructed with a similar surface.

He had been purchased by the Defendant in the Tattersalls sales in Ireland in September 2017 as a foal for &#163;18,000.00. He was backed and broken in the late part of 2018 and early part of 2019 by another of the Defendant&#8217;s employees, the head lad Allan Williams, and had been exercised regularly on the gallops from around that time i.e. 2018/2019. </p>

She was to lead another member of the Defendant&#8217;s staff, Gemma Stead, riding another of the Defendant&#8217;s horses called &#8220;Ivawood&#8221;.  They were accompanied by Allan Williams. The two horses walked on the road between the Defendant&#8217;s training yard and the gallops, and were then ridden onto the gallop in single file with the Claimant&#8217;s horse a few lengths ahead. They entered to the gallop along a stretch called the Shute and when they reached the gallop proper, they built up speed into a canter. Approximately 150 yards into the exercise Foxy moved to his right; the exact nature, extent and causes of the movement being in dispute, causing the Claimant to fall off and sustain a dislocation and articular fracture to her right elbow.</p>

There were other similar incidents when the Claimant was lucky not to fall off. The accident occurred as Foxy suddenly dropped his right shoulder and shied/jinking sharply to the right. The Claimant who was standing up in the stirrup irons, was unable to keep her balance on the horse; her momentum took her forwards whilst the horse moved away to the right from underneath her and she fell off. She landed on the floor and was injured. Gemma Stead&#8217;s horse jumped over the Claimant on the ground.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.7in">It is also the Claimant&#8217;s case that the Defendant is strictly liable to the Claimant for the accident and her consequential injuries, by virtue of section 2(2) of the Animals Act 1971 (&#8220;the Act&#8221;). There is no claim in negligence. I shall deal with the specific requirements for liability to be established under section 2(2) of the Act in detail in due course. By way of overview, it is the Claimant&#8217;s case that the damage (personal injury) was of a kind which the horse, unless restrained (and Foxy was not fully restrained) was likely to cause and/or if damage was caused by the horse, it was likely to be severe.  Further, the likelihood of the damage, or of it being severe, was due to characteristics of Foxy which are not normally found except at particular times or in particular circumstances. It is the Claimant&#8217;s case that the horse displayed the characteristic of shying/jinking and that this was because of particular circumstances.  Whilst all horses can shy on occasion, they only do so when triggered to do so by particular circumstances. In this case the cause of or reason for Foxy shying was not known (neither rider saw anything unusual or amiss) but it is likely that he &#8220;perceived a threat&#8221;.  Foxy was more prone to shy/jink than other horses of his age and/or to do so more violently. The Defendant, an experienced racehorse trainer, was fully aware of the characteristic of Foxy (or any horse) shying/jinking due to what was perceived to be a threat which means that the knowledge requirement under 2(2) of the Act was satisfied.</p>

This can be a little unbalancing but not generally cause Hazel or me to fall off and I say this having previously watched Hazel stay on a horse that has jinked.  Racehorses can be sharp and to be a work rider at a racing yard you should be able to stay on for those type of movements.</p>

In most circumstances shying and jinking does not result in a rider falling off. Although possible, I would not expect a rider of the Claimant&#8217;s experience to fall off unless the Horse&#8217;s actions were sudden, without warning, sharp (fast) and of sufficient movement to cause her to lose her balance and therefore unseat her. The fact that the Claimant did fall off suggests that the Horse&#8217;s actions were sudden, without warning, sharp and significant.&#8221;</p>

In most circumstances shying does not result in a rider falling off, and consequently damage is not reasonably to be expected. However, in circumstances where a horse shies or jinks when travelling at 15-20 mph, it is reasonably to be expected that if the rider does fall they will be thrown from some height and force, in which case some soft tissue injury is likely, and in such circumstances it would not be surprising if severe injury was caused. Whether severe injury is likely depends on the force of the fall, how the rider lands, and the surface the rider lands on.</p>

Whether severe injury is likely depends on the force of the fall, the surface the rider lands on, and how they land. This is a matter for legal argument.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in">CL says that on most occasions that a rider falls from a cantering horse, they do not suffer severe injury. AMT disagrees because the risk of injury, or if injury occurs of it being severe is dependent on the particular circumstances. Where a horse shies at speed it is reasonably to be expected that if the rider does fall, they will be thrown from some height and force, in which case some soft tissue injury is likely, and in such circumstances, it would not be surprising if severe injury was caused. Whether severe injury is likely depends on the force of the fall, how the rider lands and the surface the rider lands on.</p>

Ms Stead said that she had ridden Foxy on numerous occasions and that she and the Claimant both regularly rode him particularly after the Claimant injured her ankle in March 2020.   She had ridden Foxy the day before the accident on the round gallop. The records indicate that she had ridden the horse and having heard Gemma Stead I am entirely satisfied that she did indeed ride Foxy whilst the Claimant was also working.

There was no mention of this in the witness statement and I find the explanation that she was not asked a question by her very experienced solicitor about whether she had ever told anyone Foxy was sharp/skittish to be implausible given that knowledge on the part of the keeper is a necessary ingredient under section 2 of the Act. It is accepted that when Foxy was aged two and the Claimant first rode him Alan Williams mentioned about being careful; this broadly accords with his recollection. However it does not appear to be in dispute that after that Foxy matured significantly. Mr Williams was clear that he had no discussions about Foxy not leading and that if the Claimant had mentioned an issue that he would have done something about it. I accept his evidence on this issue.</span></p>

As agreed by the experts </span>if Foxy was significantly more difficult to ride than the average 3-year-old racehorse the expectation would be that the history showed that riders had fallen from him frequently.<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> The Claimant was unable to explain the conflict between the lack of incidents and her evidence.  When Foxy was still being trained and still &#8220;learning&#8221; the Claimant fell off him (he had not been out on the gallops at this stage), but  she  accepted that he continued to mature after that and that she did not fall off him on any other occasion before the accident although she had ridden him on her estimation well over a hundred times (and in addition others had ridden him) no doubt past innumerable objects that would have caused a &#8220;highly strung&#8221; horse to shy, even more so if it had such a very low threshold (e.g. various wild animals, vegetation blowing in the wind, shadows).</span></p>

However she then agreed with the proposition that he was more likely to shy than the average horse if he perceived a threat. At other stages during questioning she said that he was more likely to react that &#8220;the others&#8221; on the yard (meaning horses of the same age). Standing back and taking her evidence as a whole my view is that she considered Foxy to be a typical or &#8220;normal&#8221; horse of his age, but in comparison with the other horses in the yard of the same age he was the most reactive to things that concerned him  (whatever that be).

He said that in most cases when there is such a movement the rider will not fall; &#8220;probably won&#8217;t; possibly will&#8221;.

The Claimant estimated he moved three to four feet to the right and I find it was no more than that. Having heard her evidence I do not accept after he moved to the right he &#8220;ended up on the far right of the gallop&#8221;. In my view this is inconsistent with Gemma Stead&#8217;s general impression of the right then left movement (more of a&#8221; sidestep&#8221;) and also, to a degree, with the Claimant&#8217;s own oral evidence that the movement was 3-4 feet to the right.</span></p>

Having heard both experts it is clear that on balance they each think that Foxy moved suddenly right because of a perceived threat of an unknown nature. However they are wholly reliant on witness descriptions with little by way of objectively ascertainable fact (save that the horse deviated from a straight line and the Claimant fell off) and had never visited the gallops and inspected the surface or surroundings.

He rejected 'probable' or 'more probable than not' as correct and preferred 'such as might happen' or 'such as might well happen'. I would respectfully agree with the Lord Justice's rejection of 'probable' and 'more probable than not' but am unable to agree that 'such as might happen' a phrase consistent with no more than a possibility can be right. A mere possibility is not, in my opinion, enough. I have suggested 'reasonably to be expected' as conveying the requisite meaning of ' likely' in paragraph (a).

If the injury was, in fact, severe it would be almost inevitable that, barring some freak, it was likely to be severe. To borrow from Lord Hobhouse in a case of occupier's liability, Tomlinson v Congleton Borough Council (2004) 1 AC 46, 79, it is a fallacy to say that because drowning is a serious matter there is, therefore, a serious risk of drowning. The problem, as I see it, is the level of generality at which you ask and answer the question. If the question is if you fall off a rearing horse onto a hard surface and the horse falls on top of you, is the injury likely to be severe, you may get one answer. But if the question is if you fall off a horse, is the injury likely to be severe, you may get another. I do not believe that this problem has yet been squarely confronted in the cases.&#8221;</p>

Once it is recognised that at least part of the factual matrix must be applied it then becomes a question of degree. For my part when considering the first limb of section 2(2)(a) in the context of behaviour of a horse when ridden it is difficult to see how the particularity of a person being in the saddle can be sensibly and properly ignored when assessing whether the damage (injury) was of a kind likely to be caused (reasonably to be expected).  Otherwise if this factual particularity were stripped away when considering the question under the first limb of section 2(2)(a) one would be left in a case such as the present, with an assessment of the likelihood of damage being caused by a horse standing, walking or canting unridden when it moved.  Sensibly this cannot have been intended to be the correct approach if the behaviour was exhibited whilst the horse was being ridden.</p>

In the present case the judge heard expert evidence on the likelihood of serious injury, which Maurice Kay LJ has quoted. The evidence was that riders fall off horses every day and do not sustain severe injury. I would not characterise the first three questions as controversial. Almost anyone who has ever ridden will have the experience of having fallen off a horse, getting up and remounting the horse. I do not, with respect, regard it as self-evident that a rider who falls off a rearing horse (or for that matter a cantering horse) is likely to suffer severe injury. It has not been suggested that the expert evidence on the likelihood of injury was inadmissible, even though Etherton LJ suggested that expert evidence need not be called.

The Defendant&#8217;s case on this surface lessening impact was clear (and pleaded). The Claimant said that the surface on the canter was not &#8220;soft play&#8221; and although soft that was &#8220;only if you compare it to concrete&#8221; and that &#8220;you can easily get injured falling on an all weather gallop&#8230;you can be pretty much unscathed or you can be badly injured &#8220; and &#8220; you cannot  possibly say  that it would be surprising if a person  was injured falling&#8221;.  However given the three elements of her evidence to which I have referred, and in particular her exaggeration of Foxy&#8217;s propensity to shy, I treat the Claimant&#8217;s evidence on this issue with some caution. It was the agreed evidence of the experts that if a rider falls onto the &#8220;relatively soft surface&#8221; of an all weather gallop, then the risk of severe injury is less than if falling onto a harder surface. I am satisfied that there was a significantly reduced risk of severe injury caused by falling onto this approved surface when compared to ordinary ground (and a very much greater reduction when compared to a road). Beyond that I cannot properly go as I have no more detailed or focussed evidence.  I should add that I do not fully understand the relevance/ significance of comment in the Claimant&#8217;s statement given (without any detail) that the surface was &#8220;patchy&#8221;. The Defendant&#8217;s unchallenged evidence was that the surface was given a walked inspection every day and also harrowed. </span></p>

It is certainly difficult to see how the Claimant could have undertaken such a wide analysis without reliable statistics being recorded (and without obvious bias if the records only considered those who attended hospitals).  However in this case Mr Lane was able to produce a report from the TRL British Eventing Falls data base which to his knowledge (as a very experienced expert who has appeared in a number of the reported cases) provides &#8220;the only comprehensive statistics concerning rider falls which are available&#8221;. In my view they do provide some objective evidence based assistance as to the general picture of falls from horses.  The statistics show the risk of severe injury arising from a fall during eventing (so not whilst merely walking or cantering at leisure) and onto what Mr Lane said was likely to be harder ground than the gallops in this case, was less than 3%.  Out of 74 falls thankfully only two people sustained severe injuries. </span></p>

If the surface is a road the answer may be markedly different to a horse being ridden on other surfaces. In the present case (and again perhaps unusually) particularity does not assist the Claimant to prospectively satisfy the requirement as the surface onto which she fell was specially constructed for purpose and was to a degree shock absorbent.

Ultimately it has not been necessary to determine it as I am not satisfied on the evidence presented in this case that taken as a generality if a person falls from a moving horse as a result of it shying/jinking/moving suddenly to the right it is likely (reasonably to be expected) that they suffer severe injury. Also in this case additional particularity would not assist the Claimant as it would be wholly artificial to approach the test on the basis of a fall onto tarmac or onto particularly hard ground given that this was not the case.

A person is not liable under section 2 of this Act for any damage suffered by a person who has voluntarily accepted the risk thereof. So a non-employed person would not have a claim under the act.

Thus the Cummings interpretation means that requirement (b) will be met in most cases where damage was caused by dangerous behaviour as described in requirement (a).

I do not see the distinction that Mr Westcott sought to draw between cases involving horses that buck or rear and the present case. The manifestation of the characteristic is to shoot forwards uncontrollably. The stimulus caused the horse to be frightened but the characteristic is that to be found in horses that when frightened they will shoot forwards at speed in an uncontrolled manner.&#8221;</p>

Driving all day is unrealistic, and I just can&#8217;t do it, physically.</span></p>

I concentrated more on rugby in the years just before the accident and when I stopped the rugby training I still had the football. 147 After going back to football after the accident, I did not choose to play goalkeeper and I tended to play as a defender but sometimes ended up in goal. The team did have a goalie but whilst she played in goal for matches, she was unable to train some week. I think I started one actual match in goal but had to come off after 20 minutes. I was asked to be goalie more often during training. I wanted to help but I couldn&#8217;t be fully committed. Like catching rugby balls I can catch footballs and make saves. Anyone can soften a catch or stop by letting their hand or arm &#8220;give&#8221; rather than be rigid. You can adapt and fall without taking much, if any, weight on the right elbow, using your side or shoulder, for instance.</p>

I can move my arm so that I can throw it a short way, almost rolling it out, but it is not a great technique which would use a whipping action extending or putting pressure on the elbow or wrist. What I can be seen doing is mainly just swinging my arm and essentially the ball leaves my hand rather than the arm/hand whipping and controlling the ball properly. Before injury I would be able to throw it over-arm from the 18-yard box to the half way line. Not afterwards.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;There is a sequence, dated the 20th September 2022 when Ms Boyd is seen to play football. In this sequence she plays in goal and appears to use both arms normally. When she falls over, she uses her right hand to push herself back up onto her feet. She saves the ball with both hands. The arc of elbow movements displayed during these sequences is greater than that which she demonstrated to me at the time of my examination. During the course of the video sequence, she does not display any significant disability affecting her right arm.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Ms Boyd displayed surprisingly normal elbow function when the videos were shot. She did not display any significant disability. Irrespective she did sustain a significant injury to right elbow as a result of the accident of 23rd June 2020, despite (based on the video evidence) having made a surprisingly good recovery from this serious injury. Clearly she is capable of light to moderately strenuous work using her right arm but I think she would have some difficulty in conducting some of the more strenuous work of a stable hand (e.g. fitting a heavy saddle, mucking out, moving a heavy bale of hay etc).</p>

Ms Boyd clearly enjoys playing contact sport and appears to use her arm normally and I am sure can carry out her normal day-to-day activities.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I do not consider the surveillance footage and evidence is consistent with the history as provided by the Claimant or my examination findings. Taking into account the video footage, I think it likely that Ms Boyd is able to go about household chores in a largely unrestricted fashion. It is likely that she, taking into account the severity of the injuries and her subsequent treatment, would have some disability in regard to upper arm function, but her disability is clearly substantially less than stated to me at the time of my examination of her.&#8221;</p>

I maintain the view expressed in my letter of the 5<span style="font-size:8pt">th </span>October 2023, that the video evidence was at variance with the level of disability as documented to me by the Claimant. This does not, of course, mean that the Claimant does not have any issues affecting her right elbow, simply that the disability stated is evidently less than that which was documented to me at the time of my examination of the Claimant. Accordingly, it is not possible to make an accurate assessment of the true level of the disability that the Claimant experiences as a direct consequence of the right elbow fracture/dislocation.&#8221;</p>

I note there are various readings for her elbow range of motion, an element of these is likely to be down to observer error. There is also likely to be some variation in elbow range of motion dependent on the time of day, activity level, soreness in the elbow and swelling etc. at the time (and the Claimant added use of painkillers).&#8221;</p>

On the final report range of motion was 40&#176; to 100&#176; with both myself and Mr Wand and looking at the video and the surveillance she is probably getting closer to 110&#176; to 120&#176; as that is what is required to get your hand to your mouth. During the videos I have not seen her demonstrate full flexion or extend the elbow fully.&#8221;</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The actual range of motion at this stage is not important however, as she has a functional range of motion that would allow her to undertake most activities of daily living and she indicated to me that she can undertake all of her activities of daily living and was playing football. What she struggles with is pain and strength in the upper limb. Whilst in the video surveillance she is seen walking the husky dog, he seems to only pull sharply on one or two occasions. Likewise in all of the football / rugby events she tends to favour pushing up on her left arm to get up off the floor and is seen rubbing her right elbow which would indicate she is suffering from pain. Again there is one event where she is pulled up by her right arm but this is a single solitary event, so the surveillance does not alter my original opinion that she is likely to struggle with heavy repeated bimanual tasks. In my opinion there is a difference between a husky dog and a horse in terms of the strength requirements to ride and lead a horse.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Mr Wand&#8217;s medical report however tends to indicate more significant disabilities of daily living and therefore in my opinion these videos do contradict the information as recorded by Mr Wand at the time of his medical report (it&#8217;s accuracy subsequently disputed by Mrs Boyd). It does seem unusual however why she would give different information to Mr Wand as opposed to myself as if she was exaggerating for gain I would have anticipated similar claims being given to both of us. 4.6 In terms of my medical report, I have seen nothing in the video surveillance to contradict her claim to myself that she does not feel that she is able to undertake heavy bimanual tasks. Ultimately however it would be up to the Court to determine whether they think that she is exaggerating her symptoms for financial gain however the schedule of damages provided to myself does not contain any claims other than the loss of employment/future potential surgery if she is exaggerating the symptoms she does not appear to have requested financial help for helping with shopping trips gardening etc. which I would have expected.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.7in">Both experts agree there is a risk of developing osteoarthritis in the elbow particularly with the coronoid fracture with involvement of the coronoid in the fracture and they have estimated this to be 30% risk over a 10-to-20-year time period. This is potentially likely to result in some increase in stiffness, pain, and discomfort. In the worst scenario an elbow replacement may be required but both experts agree that the risk of this would be extremely low i.e. in all probability would not be required and would be postponed until at least until she is into her 60s.&#8221;</p>

She was in a brace and sat on a quiet horse and walked and trotted; then tried &#8220;a bouncier&#8221; one and did not feel in control as the horse may pull too much for her to hold it.

Thus, a claimant should not be exposed to costs liability merely because he is shown to have been dishonest as to some collateral matter or perhaps as to some minor, self-contained head of damage. If, on the other hand, the dishonesty went to the root of either the whole of his claim or a substantial part of his claim, then it appears to me that it would be a fundamentally dishonest claim: a claim which depended as to a substantial or important part of itself upon dishonesty."&#8221;</p>

It is difficult to see how the dishonest exaggeration potentially inflated the claim other than in relation to an award of pain suffering and loss of amenity. The dishonesty did not develop beyond exaggeration of the extent of her disability on aspects of daily life. The Claimant has made no continuing care claim or claim for equipment or adaptions, and I am satisfied that, despite her hopes, she was unable to continue to work as a rider or a stable hand. She disclosed her attempt to train as an HGV driver. I do not accept that the claim in relation to painkillers is dishonest.  In my judgment the content of the schedule has not materially altered between the first and third schedule (other than the approach of Counsel as to the disability issue; which realistically represented refinement rather than significant underlying change).</p>

However I accept that by the autumn of 2021 the Claimant should have been looking for some form of employment and it was unreasonable not to do so. I have no doubt that the income placement payments which she continued to received up to June 2022 meant that she did not feel that it was necessary to try and find some form or employment however limited /part time.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.58in;text-indent:0.42in">A potential rationale advanced by Mr Knifton for the issuing of higher value claims in London is that the Masters have relevant expertise for personal injury/clinical negligence claims and this is not, or at least not necessarily, the case when such a case is managed in a regional centre. I have also previously been given an explanation that it is more likely to achieve Judicial continuity and a trial (if appropriate) before a High Court Judge. These arguments, to the extent that they ever had validity, belong in the past. As long ago as December 2015 Lord Justice Briggs, as he then was, set out the principle that no case is too big to be resolved in the regions in his Civil Courts Structure Review; Interim (December 2015) and Final report (July 2016). All the main regional centres have resident Designated Civil Judges, experienced District Judges some well versed in personal injury/clinical negligence litigation (and solicitors based in a city with a regional centre should ensure that are aware of whether there are Judges with relevant expertise at that centre) and six are appeals centres from the County Court with visiting High Court Judges before whom appropriate trials can be listed. Many High Court claims, and the present case is a paradigm, are unlikely to be of such value that they are unsuitable for hearing by a Deputy High Court Judge (it should be borne in mind that personal injury claims of a value under &#163;1million may be suitable for transfer to the County Court).&#160;As I indicated during submissions it is my experience that a Claimant could even end up in the position of having his case heard at the Royal Courts of Justice by one of the section 9 Judges based in the relevant court centre where the claim should have been issued.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.58in;text-indent:0.42in">As for Judicial continuity Judges based at or visiting the Royal Courts of Justice do not ordinarily case manage higher value personal injury/clinical negligence claims through to a trial which they will conduct. However this can and does happen in regional centres (and can be requested, as can listing a CCMC before a salaried and/or specialist District Judge). Also given the large number of cases (and the high percentage which settle) it is often, if not usually the case, that it is not possible to ensure that a personal injury or clinical negligence conducted at the Royal Courts of Justice has its pre-trial review before the trial Judge. Again, this can be achieved in a regional centre.</p>

In the present case the Master faced the wholly unnecessary issue of how to deal with a site visit without the appropriate local knowledge. Whether such a visit can take place can have a significant impact at the CCMC stage as the extent to which photographs and/or a video of the accident scene are necessary may depend upon the Judge's ability to visit the scene (without undue loss of court time) and /or local knowledge. A Judge in the relevant regional centre is also likely to have been knowledge of other matters which may impact on costs budgeting&#160;and to be able to set a fixed trial date at the CCMC hearing which can be of very considerable help to those who will need to attend (including experts yet to be instructed).</p>

Further, it is also incorrect that this case proceeded smoothly using facilities for remote evidence. It was very difficult to hear some witnesses e.g. Gemma Stead due to the type of issues that frequently affect witnesses giving evidence remotely with the advocates &#8220;having to do the best we can&#8221;. The starting point remains that witness should ordinarily attend at trials (unless being conducted wholly remotely) in person to give evidence.  A case such as this with such obvious and strong ties to the Cardiff area should have been issued and heard in Cardiff. All of the witnesses were based near Cardiff, none of the four experts were based in London; three were based in Wales/West County. It seems clear to me that consideration was largely (if not solely) given to convenience of solicitors and Counsel. This is not an ordinarily reasonable approach to conducting litigation.</span></p>

Litigants are entitled to engage any lawyer they choose, but the question of where the claim should be issued, managed and heard (and indeed the reasonableness of the decision not to instruct local solicitors in the context of the recovery of costs) is to be judged objectively.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.7in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">It seems clear that the parties failed to adequately consider whether liability should be determined as a preliminary issue before the first Costs and Case Management Hearing (which is the appropriate time for the issue to be determined). The likely savings in terms of costs and the greater speed with which the issue of liability could have been determined were both considerable and obvious. As I have stated it was the approach adopted in each one of the Animals Act cases cited to me. Any party who does not give consideration to whether liability (or other discrete issues) could be determined as a preliminary issue (or if the issue is raised by another party does not give that party&#8217;s reasoning due consideration) is failing to further the overriding objective and may be liable to criticism by the Court and potentially face adverse costs consequences.  Here liability should have been identified as a preliminary issue before the first hearing (when there would have been no suggestion of quantum credibility issues having any potential relevance to liability issues). </span></p>

No cross over in terms of credibility between liability and quantum issues/fundamental dishonesty was suggested to me at any stage. </span></p>
