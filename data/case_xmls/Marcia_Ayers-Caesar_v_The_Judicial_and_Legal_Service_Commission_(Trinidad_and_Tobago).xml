By its order the Court of Appeal set aside the orders made by Harris J in the High Court, with the exception of certain orders made in favour of the Attorney General, and granted declarations which can be summarised as follows:</p>

The result of such conduct was that the claimant was coerced and pressured into resigning her office, a form of removal from office not permitted by the Constitution.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows from section 137(1) that a judge can be removed from office only on the grounds of inability or misbehaviour, and only in accordance with the provisions of that section. Sections 137(2) and (3) set out the procedure which must be followed. In the case of a judge other than the Chief Justice, the procedure begins when the Commission represents to the President that the question of removing the judge ought to be investigated. The President is then required to appoint a tribunal consisting of a chairman and at least two other members selected by the Prime Minister, after consulting the Commission, from persons who hold or have held office as judges of courts of unlimited civil and criminal jurisdiction in some part of the Commonwealth, or courts having appellate jurisdiction over such courts. The tribunal then has to enquire into the matter and report on the facts to the President, with a recommendation as to whether the President should refer the question of removal of the judge from office to the Judicial Committee. If the tribunal so recommends, the President must then refer the question of removal to the Judicial Committee. If, following such a reference, the Judicial Committee advises the President that the judge ought to be removed from office for inability or for misbehaviour, then the President must remove the judge from office. Under section 137(4), where a reference is made to a tribunal, the judge may be suspended from performing the functions of his or her office until either the tribunal recommends against a referral to the Judicial Committee or the Judicial Committee advises the President that the judge ought not to be removed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The limited grounds on which judges can be removed from office under section 137, and the nature of the procedure laid down in that section, reflect the Constitution&#8217;s recognition of the importance of protecting judicial independence from the executive, as a vital aspect of governance in accordance with the rule of law. In relation to the grounds for removal, section 137 addresses the risk that a judge may become unfit to perform his or her duties or may engage in serious misconduct, by enabling the judge to be removed for inability to perform the functions of his or her office, or for misbehaviour. In limiting the circumstances in which a judge can be removed from office to inability or misbehaviour, the Constitution conforms to article 18 of the United Nations Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary (1985) (&#8220;Judges shall be subject to suspension or removal only for reasons of incapacity or behaviour that renders them unfit to discharge their duties&#8221;), and to Guideline VI.1(a)(i) of the Commonwealth (Latimer House) Principles (2003) (&#8220;Grounds for removal of a judge should be limited to: (A) inability to perform judicial duties and (B) serious misconduct&#8221;). The threshold for removal is high. As the Board said in <span style="font-style:italic">Hearing on the Report of the Chief Justice of Gibraltar </span>[2009] UKPC 43, para 31:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;While the highest standards are expected of a judge, failure to meet those standards will not of itself be enough to justify removal of a judge. So important is judicial independence that removal of a judge can only be justified where the shortcomings of the judge are so serious as to destroy confidence in the judge&#8217;s ability properly to perform the judicial function.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In relation to the procedure to be followed, section 137 addresses the need to protect the judiciary against the threat to judicial independence, and therefore to the impartial application of the law, which would arise if the removal process could be used by the executive to penalise or intimidate judges. It achieves that objective by ensuring that the critical decisions are taken by bodies which are independent of the executive. Under section 137(3), the initial examination of the charge or complaint against the judge, leading to the decision whether to initiate the procedure, is normally taken by the Commission: a body whose membership is designed to ensure its independence. If it decides to initiate the procedure, the investigation into the judge is then carried out by a judicial tribunal which is also independent of the executive. Following that investigation, the judge can be removed from office only if the tribunal recommends that the question of removal should be referred to the Judicial Committee, and the Judicial Committee then advises that the judge ought to be removed. In this regard, the Constitution is again in conformity with Guideline VI.1(a)(i) of the Latimer House Principles (&#8220;In cases where a judge is at risk of removal, the judge must have the right &#8230; to be judged by an independent and impartial tribunal&#8221;). </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is also necessary to note section 4 of the Constitution, which recognises a number of fundamental human rights and freedoms, including &#8220;(b) the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law&#8221;. One aspect of the protection of the law is an individual&#8217;s &#8220;right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations&#8221;, protected against legislative abrogation, abridgement or infringement by section 5(2)(e).</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The material facts, as found by Harris J, can be summarised as follows. During 2016 the claimant, who was then the Chief Magistrate, responded to an advertisement giving notice that there were a number of vacancies on the High Court and inviting applications for appointment. She underwent assessment and interview in January 2017, and on 15 March 2017 was informed that her application had been successful. Arrangements were made for her to be sworn in on 12 April 2017. Some of the other successful candidates asked for their swearing-in to be postponed to enable them to complete outstanding professional commitments, but the claimant did not do so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">When the claimant&#8217;s appointment was announced, there were some expressions of concern over the number and nature of the part-heard matters which she would leave behind in the Magistrates&#8217; Court. On 10 April the Chief Justice telephoned her and asked about this. Her explanation left the Chief Justice under the impression that, apart from a small number of short trials, the majority of her part-heard matters were &#8220;paper committals&#8221;, ie applications for the committal of defendants for trial, supported by witness statements, which could be re-listed before another magistrate without causing undue delay. The Chief Justice requested her to provide a list of all her part-heard matters with short explanations. On 11 April she sent the Chief Justice a list which had been prepared by a member of staff of the Magistrates&#8217; Court. It comprised 28 cases (some documents refer to the list as containing 23 cases, but nothing turns on the precise number). There was no indication that oral evidence had already been heard in any of the cases. The Chief Justice asked her if she would wish for more time to dispose of her part-heard matters, but she declined. On 12 April she was sworn in as a judge of the High Court. </p>

The case had not been included in the list provided to the Chief Justice. According to reports which appeared in the press the following day, prosecuting counsel expressed concern that cases part-heard by the claimant and close to completion would have to start again before another magistrate, with the result that public money would be wasted and defendants would have to spend longer in custody awaiting trial. Other attorneys were also reported as expressing similar concerns.</p>

What precisely was said at the meeting is a matter of dispute, but the resolution of the disputed matters is not critical to our decision, on the view that we take of the law. However, we will proceed on the basis of Harris J&#8217;s findings, which reflect the evidence given by the Chief Justice and the minute of the Commission&#8217;s meeting. At his meeting with the claimant, the Chief Justice told her that the Commission had met and considered the matter sufficiently serious to trigger a disciplinary enquiry but had made no decision in that regard. It had decided that she should be given the option of withdrawing from the High Court bench and returning to the magistracy to complete her part-heard matters. The meeting concluded with the claimant agreeing to resign from her office as a High Court judge, and agreeing to accompany the Chief Justice to a meeting with the President later that day, where she handed the President her letter of resignation.</p>

In the Court of Appeal, Yorke-Soo Hon JA stated that she was not persuaded that there was evidence before the Commission that the claimant had committed any act or acts falling within the section. There was no evidence that she lacked the ability or temperament to perform her functions as a judge. As to the question of misbehaviour, even if her large case load of part-heard matters raised an issue as to her ability in the area of case management, those matters were not connected to her work as a judge but as a magistrate. The allegations against her dealt with conduct which arose prior to her appointment as a judge and concerned matters related to her availability to take up her High Court appointment. </p>

In the present case, the purported misbehaviour would have been in regard to assurances given to the Chief Justice as to the number of part-heard matters the claimant had outstanding, or the fact of having so many part-heard matters outstanding and for so long. Since those were matters occurring before the claimant took office as a judge, they could not have triggered or met the section 137 threshold. Mendon&#231;a JA expressed no opinion on this question.</p>

The first was the claimant&#8217;s ability to manage her caseload, which it considered to be put in question by the accumulation of a substantial number of part-heard matters. The second was her conduct during the process leading up to her appointment to the High Court, in (1) possibly misleading the Commission by failing to disclose the backlog of part-heard matters, (2) possibly misleading the Chief Justice by giving him an account of her part-heard matters which understated the true position, and (3) taking up her appointment in circumstances which resulted in a substantial number of part-heard matters being left uncompleted, in contrast to other candidates who had deferred their appointment. The third matter was the effect of her conduct, in leaving cases uncompleted which would have to start again, on public confidence in the administration of justice. </p>

That is not to say that the Commission&#8217;s concerns were established; or that they would, if established, be enough to justify the claimant&#8217;s removal from office: it is merely to say that they are not, as a matter of law, incapable of falling within the ambit of section 137(1). </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Section 137 protects two essential foundations of the due administration of justice. First, as the Board explained earlier, it protects judicial independence, by providing judges with security of tenure and thereby shielding the administration of justice from external influences. Secondly, it protects the administration of justice, and public confidence in the administration of justice, by enabling judges to be removed from office when they are unable to carry out the functions of their office, or when their remaining in office would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Accordingly, section 137 sets out tests, and a procedure, enabling judicial conduct to be independently investigated, and judges removed from office, when that is necessary in the interests of the due administration of justice. </p>

Authoritative guidance can be found, in particular, in two relatively recent cases: <span style="font-style:italic">Lawrence v Attorney General of Grenada </span>[2007] UKPC 18; [2007] 1 WLR 1474 and <span style="font-style:italic">Hearing on the Report of the Chief Justice of Gibraltar</span>.</p>

He went on at para 25 to quote with approval para 85 of the judgment of Gray J in the Australian case of <span style="font-style:italic">Clark v Vanstone </span>[2004] FCA 1105, (2004) 81 ALD 21:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;&#8230; in a case in which the term &#8216;misbehaviour&#8217; is used with reference to the holder of an office, the content of its meaning is to be determined by reference to the effect of the conduct on the capacity of the person to continue to hold the office. In turn, the capacity to continue to hold an office has two aspects. The conduct of the person concerned might be such that it affects directly the person&#8217;s ability to carry out the office. Alternatively, or in addition, it may affect the perceptions of others in relation to the office, so that any purported performance of the duties of the office will be perceived widely as corrupt, improper or inimical to the interests of the persons, or the organisation, for whose benefit the functions of the office are performed. In either case, the danger is that the office itself will be brought into disrepute as a result of the conduct of its holder. If that is likely to be the case, then the conduct is properly characterised as misbehaviour for the purposes of the relevant legislation.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In the light of that passage, Lord Scott identified four questions that needed to be asked: first, whether the conduct directly affected the individual&#8217;s ability to carry out the duties and discharge the functions of her office; secondly, whether the conduct might affect the perceptions of others as to her ability to carry out those duties and discharge those functions; thirdly, whether to allow her to continue in office and continue to perform her duties would be perceived as inimical to the interests of good governance; and fourthly, whether the office would be brought into disrepute as a result of that conduct (para 26). On the facts, three of those four questions were answered adversely to the appellant. That conclusion was held to justify categorising her conduct as &#8220;misbehaviour&#8221; and validating the recommendation that she should be removed from office. </p>

The case was one concerned with &#8220;inability&#8221;, although the allegation against the Chief Justice was based on a combination of defects of character, misbehaviour, and the effects of his behaviour on how he and his office were perceived. As Lord Phillips, giving the advice of the majority of the Board, observed (para 201), there is a degree of overlap between &#8220;inability&#8221; and &#8220;misbehaviour&#8221;. </p>

In that regard, it was found that perceptions of bias substantially disabled the Chief Justice from performing his judicial functions. In relation to the third and fourth questions, the essential question was whether the behaviour of the Chief Justice had brought himself and his office into such disrepute that it would damage the image of the administration of justice in Gibraltar if he continued to serve as Chief Justice (para 222). It was found that it had. &#8220;Inability&#8221; was therefore found to be established.</p>

As the preamble to the Bangalore Principles states, &#8220;public confidence in the judicial system and in the moral authority and integrity of the judiciary is of the utmost importance in a modern democratic society&#8221;, and &#8220;it is essential that judges, individually and collectively, respect and honour judicial office as a public trust and strive to enhance and maintain confidence in the judicial system&#8221;. Those recitals are reflected in the emphasis placed in the Bangalore Principles on integrity (&#8220;Integrity is essential to the proper discharge of the judicial office&#8221;), propriety (&#8220;Propriety, and the appearance of propriety, are essential to the performance of all of the activities of a judge&#8221;), competence and diligence (&#8220;Competence and diligence are prerequisites to the due performance of judicial office&#8221;). The Bangalore Principles are reflected in the Guidelines for Judicial Conduct produced for the Judiciary of Trinidad and Tobago in 2017, which similarly emphasise the importance of public confidence in the integrity of judges, and of propriety, competence and diligence. </p>

Nor would the underlying aim of the power of removal for inability or misbehaviour, namely to protect the due administration of justice, require such a limitation on its ambit. On the contrary, it is not difficult to conceive of circumstances in which conduct occurring prior to a judge&#8217;s appointment could compel an adverse answer to the four questions posed by Lord Scott and Lord Phillips: for example, where it emerged that the judge had committed a serious criminal offence prior to his or her appointment.</p>

If the claimant deliberately or recklessly misled the Commission and the Chief Justice about her backlog of part-heard matters during the process leading up to her appointment, that was something which might affect her capacity to perform the duties of her office. The public outcry reinforced the grounds for concern about the impact of her conduct on public confidence in the administration of justice. Her behaviour in not seeking a deferment of her appointment in order to enable her to complete the part-heard matters, and the issue raised as to her case management ability, were also potentially relevant to the questions of &#8220;inability&#8221; and &#8220;misbehaviour&#8221;.

It is no part of the Commission&#8217;s role, where it has found that there are circumstances justifying such a representation, to seek to procure the removal of the judge by other means, such as resignation. For the Commission to present the judge with the option of resigning, in those circumstances, is for it to place the judge under pressure to resign, because of the risk of reputational damage if he or she does not resign and disciplinary proceedings follow. In that regard, we note Bereaux JA&#8217;s observations at para 158 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal:</p>

The mere contemplation of such damage is sufficient to persuade a judge to resign so as to avoid the oppression that disciplinary proceedings bring along with the odium likely to accompany the public revelation that such a process has been started. Thus, the mere threat of initiation of the section 137 procedure, is, by itself, sufficient to pressure a judge into resigning her office.&#8221;</p>

The Board also accepts that, in a situation where a judge is liable to be the subject of an investigation under section 137, it is desirable that the judge should have access to advice and support from a senior member of the judiciary; and it is possible, in such a situation, that the judge may be advised that it would be in his or her best interests to consider resigning. If a fair procedure is followed by the Commission, so that the judge is given notice of the complaint or allegations in question and is allowed to respond, then the judge will normally have the opportunity to take advice, and to resign if he or she considers that appropriate, before formal disciplinary proceedings are begun. </p>

He is directly involved in the section 137 process as the chairman ex officio of the Commission (and, in this case, as the source of the complaints or allegations which the Commission considered); and, if the Commission decides to make a representation, he is also the person who will have to advise the President whether the judge should be suspended. The role which he might normally play in providing advice and support to the judge in question, as head of judicial administration in Trinidad and Tobago, must in those circumstances be delegated to another judge. In the present case it appears that the Chief Justice did not keep separate in his dealings with the Commission and with the claimant the three different roles in which he was concerned in the matter: his role as chair of the Commission, his role as Chief Justice responsible for the efficient operation of the court system, and his pastoral role as an experienced senior judge meeting a more junior colleague to address a difficult and potentially distressing situation that had arisen. </p>

It had decided that she should be given the option of withdrawing from the High Court bench and returning to the magistracy to complete her part-heard matters. The meeting concluded with the claimant agreeing to resign from her office as a High Court judge. She submitted her resignation to the President later the same day.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">What the Chief Justice told the claimant placed her under pressure to resign, as the implicit alternative of a disciplinary enquiry &#8211; &#8220;effectively the equivalent of impeachment proceedings&#8221;, as it was described in <span style="font-style:italic">Rees v Crane </span>at p 193 &#8211; would be damaging to her professional and personal reputation and to her standing among her colleagues. It is unsurprising that she responded by agreeing to resign. Nevertheless, it is argued on behalf of the Commission that it did not bring about the claimant&#8217;s resignation, and that its violation of her constitutional rights (in depriving her of a fair hearing) does not, therefore, render it liable for the loss flowing from her resignation. The argument is based principally on the contention that, when the Chief Justice told the claimant what the Commission had decided in relation to disciplinary proceedings, he was not acting on its behalf, but exceeded his authority.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This contention was accepted by Harris J, but rejected by the Court of Appeal, for reasons which the Board finds persuasive. At its meeting, the Commission decided, as recorded in its minute, that &#8220;the information before it triggered and met the threshold for disciplinary enquiry but considered also the need for the expediting of Mrs Ayers-Caesar&#8217;s outstanding part-heard matters&#8221;, that &#8220;Mrs Ayers-Caesar be given the option of withdrawing from the High Court bench&#8221;, and that &#8220;in the event she refuses to withdraw, the Commission would consider instituting disciplinary action in accordance with section 137&#8221;. In order for that decision to be implemented, someone had to communicate it to the claimant, so as to give her the option of resigning from the High Court before disciplinary action was instituted. The obvious person to do so was the Chief Justice, since he was the chairman of the Commission. The natural inference to be drawn from the minute is therefore that the Commission authorised the Chief Justice to communicate its decision to the claimant. That is what he did at his meeting with the claimant, as explained in para 52 above, and in doing so he was acting in his capacity as chairman of the Commission. The meeting concluded with her agreeing to resign, as the Commission had intended.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Harris J accepted that the Chief Justice was authorised to communicate the Commission&#8217;s decision that the claimant should be given the option to resign, but not, as he put it, the potential for the invocation of section 137. The Court of Appeal overturned that conclusion for a number of reasons, which the Board finds compelling. It will suffice to mention two. First, it is clear from the terms of the minute that the &#8220;option&#8221; of resignation was considered to be an alternative to disciplinary proceedings: an alternative which was preferable because it was thought that only the claimant&#8217;s return to the magistracy would enable her to complete her part-heard matters. It was inherent in the Commission&#8217;s decision that the alternative to resignation was disciplinary proceedings. Communication of the Commission&#8217;s decision therefore required some mention of that alternative to resignation. That was communicated by the Chief Justice&#8217;s telling the claimant that the Commission considered her conduct to meet the threshold for disciplinary proceedings. Secondly, although evidence was given by the Chief Justice, by another member of the Commission, and by its secretary, no-one gave evidence that the Chief Justice had exceeded his authority by telling the claimant about its decision in relation to disciplinary proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In addition to the argument based on authority, counsel for the Commission have also argued that the communication of the Commission&#8217;s decision was not the cause of the claimant&#8217;s resignation, notwithstanding that she agreed to resign almost immediately afterwards. This contention was accepted by Harris J, who concluded that the claimant resigned out of embarrassment. His finding was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The issue turns on an analysis of the evidence, which was dealt with fully by the Court of Appeal. We agree with their reasoning, and there is nothing we can usefully add.</p>

In relation to the other issues raised in this appeal, the Board agrees with the Court of Appeal, for the reasons explained above. The Board concludes that the declarations as to the unlawfulness of the Commission&#8217;s conduct should stand. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.</p>
