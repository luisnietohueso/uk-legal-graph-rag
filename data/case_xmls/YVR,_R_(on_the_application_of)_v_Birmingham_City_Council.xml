	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appellant in this appeal is a severely disabled young man who will never be able to work and who is dependent on state benefits. His eligible social care needs have been assessed and are met by Birmingham City Council, which charges him for the provision of those services, as it is entitled but not obliged to do by the applicable legislation. The issue on this appeal is whether the Council&#8217;s charging policy was adopted in breach of the public sector equality duty (&#8216;the PSED&#8217;) on the ground that the Council failed to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination and to advance equality of opportunity for severely disabled persons such as the appellant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appellant is a severely disabled young man. He lives at home with his parents (his mother acts as his litigation friend) and siblings. He is profoundly autistic and has epilepsy, severe learning disabilities and other mental ill-health diagnoses. He is non-verbal, and can exhibit what are described as challenging behaviours, although that term does not do justice to the behaviour with which his family, and in particular his mother, have to cope. As the judge observed, his mother&#8217;s evidence is eloquent testimony to her long labour of love in providing the happiest life and best opportunities she can for her son. Her own personal care for him is a crucial part of the support on which he relies. </p>

These &#8216;eligibility criteria&#8217; are explained in section 13 of the Act, and in regulations made under it. They relate to a person&#8217;s assessed physical or mental impairment, and inability, by reason of that impairment, to achieve certain &#8216;outcomes&#8217;.</p>

In what was at the date of the hearing in the court below the appellant&#8217;s most recent assessment (September 2023), he was assessed as being unable, by reason of his disabilities, to achieve any of the following outcomes: (a) managing his own daily nutrition, (b) maintaining personal hygiene, (c) managing toileting, (d) dressing himself, (e) &#8216;making use of his home safely&#8217; &#8211; he cannot be left alone and unattended anywhere at home, and (f) maintaining a habitable home environment.

The appellant attends a Council day centre all day on weekdays, where he receives one-to-one support. He is provided with one-to-one support from a Council carer at home for a set number of additional hours per week (increased at his last review from 10 to 30, as his mother was herself starting to struggle to keep up with his needs). As well as meeting his eligible needs, the day centre and the appellant&#8217;s personal carer enable him to keep calm, to maintain a routine, and to stay fully occupied, all of which are important for his wellbeing and help to manage his behaviour. They also enable the appellant to enjoy physical and social activities which contribute to his quality of life. They enable him to communicate, to go to the park, to enjoy walking and swimming, to negotiate roads and shops, and to eat out on a weekend day at a favourite caf&#233; where he and the staff know each other. </p>

He is also entitled to the Universal Credit &#8216;limited capability for work-related activity&#8217; allowance (&#8216;LCWRA&#8217;). This is paid to individuals like the appellant who, by reason of their disability, are likely to have higher living costs than others (for example, in his case needing a frequent supply of fresh clothes), but who cannot supplement their benefits income by earning. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appellant is also entitled to the Personal Independence Payment (&#8216;PIP&#8217;). This is a non-means-tested benefit. There are two parts to it. The daily living part is intended to provide for the cost of getting help with everyday activities if an individual needs that help. Activities under this heading include preparing food, personal hygiene, dressing, reading, communicating, and socialising. The mobility part is intended to provide for the cost of getting help with physically moving around, leaving the home, following a route and travelling. </p>

(Some services &#8211; such as the provision of disability aids and adaptations &#8211; must be provided free of charge: section 3 of the Act.) If an authority proposes to make a charge, it must make an assessment of the individual&#8217;s financial resources (section 17). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By section 14(7) of the Act, the authority may not make a charge if the income of the individual would, after deduction of the amount of the charge, fall below an amount to be specified in regulations. In other words, an authority cannot charge at all unless an individual&#8217;s income is over a certain amount, and that amount is then protected from being taken in charges. This is known as the &#8216;minimum income guaranteed amount&#8217; (&#8216;MIG&#8217;). The way the MIG is worked out is set out in Regulation 7 of the Care and Support (Charging and Assessment of Resources) Regulations 2014. It is a relatively complex mechanism. It varies from individual to individual, and depends on factors relating to age and family circumstances. It also factors in disability at two levels, depending on severity of disability: at each level, a disabled individual is allocated an enhanced MIG. </p>

Nor is it obliged, if it chooses to charge, to charge the maximum permitted by the Regulations. On the contrary, in calculating an individual&#8217;s income for the purposes of the financial assessment it must make before making a charge, a local authority may &#8216;disregard such other sums the adult may receive as the authority considers appropriate&#8217; (Regulation 15(2)). Thus the Council can charge less, but not more, than the statutory scheme sets out.</p>

Contemporary documents indicate that it was adopted on the basis of a consultation exercise, policy recommendations, and a public sector equality duty impact assessment (although that assessment has not been tracked down in the Council&#8217;s records). The documents also confirm that adoption of the policy was intended to produce an increase in the Council&#8217;s revenue from these charges, but that all the revenue raised in this way was being applied to pay for adult social care (or at any rate to reduce the gap between the cost of that care to the taxpayer and the amount the Council was raising in charges). </p>

The Council, like other local authorities, is required by law to set a balanced budget. The financial plan it published in January 2023, setting out its proposed 2023/24 budget, included a very bleak prognosis as to its likely ability to do so. It identified a likely budget gap at that point of around &#163;80 million. The causes it identified were various. There was a significant impact from historic equal pay claims totalling more than &#163;1 billion. National government measures and wider economic circumstances were blamed to a degree. But the relentless rise in demand for adult social care was identified as a major unfunded pressure. Spend on adult social care was the Council&#8217;s largest single area of net expenditure, at around 43%. </p>

It confirmed that the Council had been provided with &#163;1.255 billion in exceptional financial support &#8211; a loan from central government to be paid back through asset sales. Radical spending controls were imposed and all non-essential expenditure ceased. The commissioners&#8217; report identified what was described as a &#8216;narrow path&#8217; to financial sustainability dependent on making revenue savings of &#163;293 million over the following two financial years. The power to increase council tax charges, at the same time as reducing services, was confirmed. The Council was instructed to pursue that two-year plan.

As already indicated, there is no dispute that the PSED applied to the January 2023 decision and that it required consideration of the impact of the Council&#8217;s charging policy on severely disabled persons such as the appellant. Nor is there any dispute that the duty is non-delegable, so that it is the decision maker personally who must have regard to the needs identified in section 149 (see <span style="font-style:italic">Sheakh</span> at [12]; <span style="font-style:italic">R (Hunt) v North Somerset Council</span> [2013] EWCA Civ 1320, [2014] LGR 1 provides an illustration of that point in the local authority context). Equally, Ms Clement did not suggest that the decision to issue the charging policy in its January 2023 form was ever considered by the Council&#8217;s Cabinet. The decision was in fact taken by Professor Graeme Betts CBE and Mr John Williams. Professor Betts was the Council&#8217;s Strategic Director Adult Social Care and Mr Williams was the Council&#8217;s Director for Community and Operational Services (Adult Social Care).</p>

Certain decisions, described as &#8216;key&#8217; decisions, are reserved to the Cabinet, while others may be taken by Council officers such as Professor Betts and Mr Williams. A decision which involves &#8216;entering into new commitments and/or making new savings at the value of, or in excess of, &#163;500,000 (gross value)&#8217; is a key decision which can only be taken by the Cabinet.</p>

Such a decision would therefore have involved the Council entering into a new commitment with a value in excess of &#163;500,000, which means that only the Cabinet could make such a change. But a decision <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> to change the existing policy would not involve entering into any new commitments at all, and could therefore be taken by officers. Mr Squires expressly accepted that the January 2023 decision not to change the existing policy was a decision which Professor Betts and Mr Williams were entitled to take under the Council&#8217;s constitution without reference to the Cabinet, but he submitted that the position was different for the purpose of the PSED because Professor Betts and Mr Williams were not the <span style="font-style:italic">relevant</span> decision maker for that purpose.</p>

That section requires a &#8216;public authority&#8217; to comply with the PSED when it exercises its functions, but says nothing about how it should comply or who the decision-maker has to be. Parliament can be taken to have understood that in the case of a local authority some decisions will be taken by a council&#8217;s full Cabinet, while others will be delegated to officers in accordance with the authority&#8217;s constitutional documents. The natural meaning of section 149 is that it is the person who actually takes the decision in accordance with the authority&#8217;s constitution who must comply with the PSED by having due regard to the needs identified in the section. In this case, that was the officers, Professor Betts and Mr Williams.</p>

The fact that Professor Betts and Mr Williams would not have had authority to take a different decision, i.e. to reduce or eliminate charges at an annual cost to the Council in excess of &#163;500,000, is irrelevant.</p>

Although Mr Squires did not welcome that way of formulating his case, in my judgment that is what it amounts to. It would mean, in effect, that practically every time an officer with delegated authority carried out a review of an existing policy and decided, after proper consideration of the PSED, that no change was necessary, that decision would have to be brought to Cabinet and the Cabinet members themselves would have to consider personally the equality implications of deciding not to change the existing policy. That would be detrimental to good administration and is not required by section 149.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Squires relied on the fact that the PSED is non-delegable. But that means that the decision maker cannot delegate the duty. Identification of the decision maker is a prior question which involves asking, as a question of fact, who made the decision. Once the actual decision maker is identified, there may be an issue whether the decision was <span style="font-style:italic">ultra vires</span> if that person had no authority to make the decision, but no such issue arises in this case. It is only when the decision maker has been identified that the relevance of the PSED being non-delegable arises. Thus, if the decision maker is the Council&#8217;s Cabinet, discharge of the PSED cannot be delegated to officers (cf. <span style="font-style:italic">Hunt</span>). But if the actual decision maker under an authority&#8217;s constitution is an officer, as in this case, it is that officer who must personally discharge the duty and cannot delegate it. But there is no case advanced that Professor Betts and Mr Williams did delegate the duty.</p>

An evidence gathering exercise of the nature contended for by Mr Squires was unnecessary. As explained, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Sheakh</span> at [15], &#8216;The decision maker is concerned with the obvious impacts on equality, and not with the detail of every conceivable impact&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Because the judge concluded that there was no breach of the PSED, she did not need to consider this section. However, section 31(2A) was argued before her and she concluded her judgment by saying that &#8216;if ever there were a case for accepting an argument that no further degree of procedural rigour would in any event have produced a different outcome it is surely the present one&#8217;. Although, as Mr Squires pointed out, this brief sentence does not expressly mention section 31(2A), to my mind it is a clear statement that even if there had been a breach of the PSED, it is (at least) highly likely that the outcome would have been the same if the breach had not occurred &#8211; that is to say, even if the officers&#8217; decision had been referred to the Cabinet, and the Cabinet had considered for itself the needs identified in section 149, it is highly likely that the Cabinet would have made the same decision as the officers in fact made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment the judge was entitled to reach this conclusion. In view of the Council&#8217;s dire financial situation, it is not only highly likely but almost inevitable that the same decision would have been made. Although Mr Squires pointed out that the Council&#8217;s section 114 notice was not issued until September 2023, some eight months after the January 2023 decision which is under challenge, that notice did not come out of the blue. By January 2023 the Council&#8217;s finances were already in crisis, with a predicted budget shortfall of &#163;80 million, in circumstances where the relentless rise in demand for adult social care was identified as a major unfunded pressure.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As already noted, Mr Squires accepted that ground 5 would only arise if the appeal succeeded on ground 1, which it has not. He accepted also that there would be no relief available to the appellant in the event of success on ground 5 which would add to the relief in the event of success on ground 1 because, in both cases, there would need to be a remission to the Council to take a fresh decision. It is therefore unnecessary to say anything further about this ground of appeal.</p>
