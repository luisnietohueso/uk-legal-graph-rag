Mr Lockey submits that fairness supports allowing the Defendant to air its properly arguable claim for &#163;750,000. As to expedition, he places strong reliance on the fact that the event insured under the ATE policy, namely the Claimants&#8217; liability for costs, did not arise before 3 July 2020. The Defendant was then told by the Claimants&#8217; solicitors on 13 November 2020 that an insurance claim had been made, which indicated that no direct claim against the insurer was likely to be needed. Although the Defendant made inquiries of Brit on 6 August 2021, Brit&#8217;s position was not articulated by CMS until 25 May 2023. Until then, the Defendant had no need to contemplate a NPCO application or an extension of time and any such application would have been premature.

There was no decision by the Defendant not to comply with Lambert J&#8217;s order.

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.69in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;I need mention three preliminary points. First, the Qualified One Way Costs regime does not apply to this claim as it started well before that regime came into effect in 2013. Second, the costs in issue relate principally to the costs incurred by the Defendant following the resurrection of the action in 2015. Although there is an outstanding costs liability dating back to the period when the Claimants had the benefit of public funding, the Defendant accepts that it will be unlikely to be able to enforce that liability. The Defendant&#8217;s Schedule of Costs for the purpose of an interim payment therefore relates only to costs incurred since 31 July 2015. That said, the costs figure is very high, running to just under &#163;9.33 million. Third, the Defendant seeks an order for costs against the Claimants not to be enforced without the further order of the Court. </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">I am informed that a further application may be made against the third party litigation funders MLS who have already been required to provide a security for the Defendant&#8217;s costs</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> under CPR 25.14(1) by making a payment into court in the sum of &#163;1,750,000 pursuant to the Order of Foskett J of 11 December 2017.

On that date (or earlier, and longer before the deadline), it would have been reasonable for them to ask themselves what the consequence of Lambert J&#8217;s order would be if there was no insurance recovery in the usual way. </span></p>

But the question is, what should the Defendant have done in that situation. In my judgment, it was open to the Defendant at all times to bring the question of a NPCO against Brit and an extension of time before the Court, even if there remained a prospect that the application might not ultimately be needed. As time passed, the need to raise this question with the Court became ever more pressing. </span></p>

Whilst it is unattractive for Brit to hide behind its omission to respond substantively between that date and 25 May 2023, the fact is that time was running against the Defendant for any application to extend the long-expired deadline for a NPCO application. No explanation whatsoever has been advanced for the delay between the chasing letters of 12 January 2022 and 20 April 2023. It seems that the matter simply went to sleep. Brit is not free of any blame for that gap in communications, and its lack of response during that time was unhelpful and unedifying but, in the absence of any proceedings against Brit (or even the threat of such proceedings), this was not a breach of any duty falling on Brit. </span></p>

But the need to deal with cases expeditiously carries greater weight in the present circumstances.

At no time thereafter did the Defendant appear to appreciate that it would need a substantial extension of the time within which Lambert J had sought to have the residual issues in this litigation dealt with, and it never showed any sense of urgency in pursuing the question, even after it had told Brit that it would be making its applications. </span></p>
