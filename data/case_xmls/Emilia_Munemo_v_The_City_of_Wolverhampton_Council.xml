	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When considering whether someone has become homeless intentionally, the definition of &#8216;intentionally&#8217; does not have its normal dictionary meaning in these contexts. It has a very tightly prescribed statutory meaning because, in the ordinary use of language, an applicant's homelessness is very often brought about not by an intentional act of the applicant, but rather by the intentional act of another party (such as a landlord, parent or court bailiff) who has deliberately ejected the applicant. As Lord Lowry stated in the decision of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Din v Wandsworth London Borough Council</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"> [1983] 1 AC 657, HL</span>, referring to an earlier Housing Act containing the same definition of &#8216;becoming homeless intentionally&#8217;:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue of intentionality is therefore an important one and, as might be expected, there is a considerable body of judicial authority dealing with the various aspects of the statutory regime, to which I will return below. As observed by Lord Reed JSC in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Haile v Waltham Forest LBC </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">[2015] UKSC 34; [2015] HLR 24</span>:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;&#8230;the requirement in section 193(1), and its statutory predecessors, that the authority must not be satisfied that the applicant became homeless intentionally has caused difficulties of interpretation, linked to difficulties in construing the meaning of &#8220;homelessness&#8221;.

This led to the default appeal being rendered academic and the present appeal being issued. The Respondent produced a long and detailed Review Decision, amounting to some 30 pages, signed off by Anthony Walker, Head of Homelessness and Migration at the Respondent. For the purposes of this appeal, it is necessary only for me to deal with Mr Walker&#8217;s findings in relation to intentional homelessness. It is also worth noting that the Appellant does not challenge the factual findings on appeal. Mr Nabi was clear that his client did not necessarily accept the findings that had been made by Mr Walker, but conceded that the findings were not irrational or otherwise susceptible to appeal. Consequently, for the purposes of this appeal, I accept the factual findings made by the Respondent. Those factual findings can be summarised as follows:</p>

The Amended Grounds of Appeal have largely abandoned all but one of the earlier Grounds and now focus on the issue as to whether it was reasonable for the Appellant to continue to occupy the Property and thus whether she is intentionally homeless.</p>

The legal consequences that flow from findings of fact made by the LHA are a matter for the LHA. This is particularly so where the process is there to perform a review at the request of an applicant who may not be legally represented. The burden of making inquiries as to intentionality rests with LHA. It is not for the applicant to prove his or her case, and satisfy the LHA that he or she did not become homeless intentionally.</p>

There is a difference between the Appellant admitting that the Respondent&#8217;s factual findings are correct on the one hand and accepting that the factual findings are not amenable to appeal within this s. 204 appeal process on the other. In circumstances where, as in the present case, the Appellant does not feel that she can challenge such factual findings on appeal, it does not mean that she is taken to admit those factual findings, nor does she have to. The Appellant can properly argue that, on the basis of the factual findings reached by the Respondent, which are not challenged on appeal, the Property was not reasonable for her to continue to occupy.</p>

The criticism made of Mr Walker&#8217;s decision in the present case is the failure to give proper consideration to the <span style="font-style:italic">legal</span> issue as to whether a person can reasonably continue to occupy accommodation in circumstances where an LHA has reached the conclusion that the person has obtained the tenancy by deception. This is not therefore a situation where the Appellant is seeking to suggest that further inquiries should have been made by the Respondent, or challenging the adequacy of the inquiries undertaken, it is a situation where a new legal argument is taken in the appeal that was not taken within the review process.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The present case is also somewhat different to the change of argument that occurred in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Moge</span>. In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Moge</span>, the appellant argued on appeal that inadequate searches were made. This, in one sense, was challenging the process undertaken by the LHA and how the LHA evidenced what steps it had taken to find appropriate accommodation for the appellant. In the present case, the challenge is to the Respondent&#8217;s legal analysis of intentional homelessness on the basis of the factual findings that it made. I was taken to nothing in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Moge</span> that suggested that I should refuse to hear an appeal on a legal point not taken by the Appellant in the review process. On the contrary, [27] of Snowdon LJ&#8217;s judgment supports that such a point can be taken at the appeal stage. An appeal court must, of course, remain wary about taking an overly nitpicking approach to consideration of a review decision, for the reasons set out in the judgment of Males LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Moge</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Cafferkey referred me to the relatively recent decision of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Kyle v Coventry City Council</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"> [2023] EWCA Civ 1360; [2024] H.L.R. 7</span>, which did make me pause for considerable thought. The Respondent argues that this case reinforces the broad principle that no distinction should be drawn between the raising of factual as opposed to legal issues. In that case, the appellant challenged the decision of the review officer on the basis that they had not given due consideration to the restrictions placed upon the appellant at a hostel, namely a &#8216;no visitors&#8217; policy and restrictions on smoking within the hostel, and whether this meant that the accommodation was not reasonable for the appellant to continue to occupy. The Court of Appeal held that, whilst the appellant&#8217;s representatives had referred to the &#8216;no visitors&#8217; policy and the restrictions on smoking in the hostel, they had not suggested that those rules meant that it was not reasonable for the appellant to continue to occupy the hostel accommodation; those rules were raised in the context of whether the appellant should have been given further warnings prior to eviction. The Court of Appeal held that it was not incumbent on the review officer to address every potential sub-issue in her decision. The Court of Appeal also confirmed that &#8216;reasonableness&#8217; and &#8216;suitability&#8217; are distinct concepts. Accommodation can be &#8216;suitable&#8217; even though it would not be &#8216;reasonable for a person to continue to occupy&#8217; it (per Newey LJ at [36]).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, this case is distinguishable, however, for similar reasons to the cases above. The issue in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Kyle</span> was really one of suitability for the specific appellant, i.e. whether the visitor and smoking rules rendered it &#8216;not reasonable&#8217; to continue to occupy that particular accommodation for that particular appellant. This is a mixed question of fact and law. It is different from the present case as the LHA in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Kyle</span> did not know that the appellant was raising issues about the suitability of the accommodation, for reasons specific to him, as those specific reasons had not been raised within the review process. The LHA did not have the knowledge of the issue, which was personal to him and his wants. In the present case, the issue is whether the Property was, as a matter of law, reasonable to continue to occupy where factual findings were made, and are not challenged (i.e. the suitability of the accommodation is not challenged <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>). It is not a specific suitability issue raised by this Appellant that is only in the knowledge of the Appellant. To put matters another way, the Respondent did not need the Appellant to raise the present issue to be aware of it; the Respondent needed to consider the relevant legal position once it made the factual findings that it did; the Appellant does not raise any new fact in this appeal that the Respondent was not previously aware of, or indeed anything personal to her that the Respondent would not have already known about.</p>

It is said on behalf of the Respondent that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Pieretti</span> does not assist the Appellant because there is a statutory obligation to take steps to take account of disability, whereas no such statutory obligation exists to consider the intricacies of the law of intentional homelessness within the review process if matters are not raised by the applicant. <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Pieretti</span> is distinguishable on its facts. It was concerned with clarifying Brooke LJ&#8217;s dicta in the specific context of the extent to which inquiries were required in respect of any disabilities that the applicant may have, on the background of the statutory framework concerning disability that was in place at the time. It does not, to my mind, assist either party in their arguments in the present case.</p>

This was a decision about the homelessness provisions that pre-dated the regime under the 1996 Act. It also concerned whether consideration as to the suitability of a property was given where the issue of suitability had not been raised by an appellant. For the reasons that I have set out in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment, it seems to me that there is a distinction to be drawn between cases where issues of fact or the need to undertake specific inquiries arise versus cases where issues of law are raised based upon the factual findings made by an LHA during the review process. </p>

To put matters another way, it seems to me that it is incumbent on a review officer to consider the legal ramifications of their findings of fact within the review decision process. Once an appellant receives those factual findings and, in the absence of being able to challenge those factual findings on the grounds of irrationality or otherwise, the appellant must be able on appeal to challenge the legal analysis upon which the LHA bases their review decision following on from the factual findings that the LHA made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Where it is alleged that an LHA has failed to make appropriate inquiries or consider specific issues of suitability personal to the individual appellant, one can see why there is reluctance to quash such review decisions where such matters have not been raised within the review process. Afterall, an LHA may not have sufficient knowledge of the issue to prompt the making of such inquiries. In other words, the LHA may not be in as good position as an appellant to know whether inquiries are required about a specific factual issue. However, once the factual basis of a decision is reached, and that is not challenged, the LHA does need to consider the legal implications of those findings. The LHA is in no different position to the appellant when considering those legal implications. There is, in my judgment, a distinction to be drawn between the necessity to raise factual issues (or the need for further inquiries) within the review process and raising issues of law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the present case, it seems that the review officer was cognisant of the need to consider whether the property was reasonable for the appellant to continue to occupy. As such, it was on the review officer&#8217;s &#8216;radar&#8217; that consideration needed to be given to the legal framework surrounding reasonableness of continued occupation. Whilst not explicitly previously raised by the Appellant in this case within the review decision process, the issue of whether an appellant&#8217;s conduct impacts upon whether a property is deemed reasonable to continue to occupy, or indeed whether that appellant is intentionally homeless in circumstances in which their own conduct has caused a local authority or other landlord to seek possession of a property, is a legal issue that requires consideration and is not so nuanced or obscure that it can be said it need not have been considered by the Respondent. On the contrary, it is a matter that ought to have been given consideration. If one takes a step back, it is an obvious (using the phraseology from <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cramp</span>) question to ask whether somebody who has been evicted against their will from a property, or has obtained a property that they were not entitled to, could reasonably continue to occupy that property. I therefore reject the Respondent&#8217;s argument that this was a nuanced or obscure point that the reviewing officer need not have considered until it was raised by the Appellant.</p>

The Appellant in this case could (and probably should) have raised these legal points within the review decision process. The Appellant was represented by experienced housing law solicitors and the argument taken now on appeal could have been raised within the review decision process by the Appellant&#8217;s solicitors by simply stating that, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">if you find X then the legal argument is Y, but if you find A then the legal argument is B</span>&#8221;. That would have been the most helpful course to have been followed in this case, but that does not mean that the Appellant should be debarred from taking the legal point on appeal. I do not see anything in the authorities addressed above or that I have been referred to that dictates that I should refuse to hear what I consider to be a legitimate ground or argument on appeal just because it was not raised within the review decision process. As such, I do permit the Appellant to raise this issue within this appeal.</p>

Unlike the position in <span style="font-style:italic">Abdikadir </span>in which the applicant&#8217;s solicitors did ask the Council prior to the appeal proceedings what it had done to comply with section 208(1), in the instant case no such inquiries were made, and the focus of Ms Moge&#8217;s appeal to the County Court was very much on other points, including whether Ms Moge had in fact rejected the o&#64256;er of the Flat and whether she had wrongly been classi&#64257;ed as not qualifying for accommodation in Ealing itself. The issue of compliance with section 208(1) in relation to an out-of-borough placement was therefore not at the forefront of the appeal before the Judge in the same way as it is on the appeal in this court.&#8221;</p>

That has to be determined having regard to all relevant circumstances and bearing in mind the purposes of the legislation. As I have indicated, a later event constituting an involuntary cause of homelessness can be regarded as superseding the applicant&#8217;s earlier deliberate conduct, where in view of the later event it cannot reasonably be said that, but for the applicant&#8217;s deliberate conduct, he or she would not have become homeless. Where, however, the deliberate conduct remains a but for cause of the homelessness, and the question is whether the chain of causation should nevertheless be regarded as having been interrupted by some other event, the question will be whether the proximate cause of the homelessness is an event which is unconnected to the applicant&#8217;s own earlier conduct, and in the absence of which homelessness would probably not have occurred&#8221; (at [63]).</p>

The Appellant made a further homeless application following her having being granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

What caused her to lose the accommodation was the discovery by the UKBA and then the council of the initial deception and the council&#8217;s own decision to terminate her occupation. Underlying the council&#8217;s decision and hence the loss of 34B was the fact that Ms Chishimba was not eligible for assistance in the first place.

It was a 3-bedroom property, which was initially granted as an introductory tenancy, but which subsequently became a secure tenancy a year later. Whilst it is not wholly determinative, I note that in her Defence in the possession proceedings Ms Munemo stated that the Property was her home which she and her children had come to love and appreciate. At the time Ms Munemo acquired the property it is apparent that she had settled in Wolverhampton, albeit whilst retaining the tenancy of [the Flat]. She described the Property in the Application Notice (dated 18 October 2022) as her family home. </p>

That the tenancy of 87 Thompson Avenue was susceptible to Ground 5, did not, in my view, render the Property unreasonable for the Appellant to continue to occupy for the purposes of s.191, Housing Act 1996. Ground 5 is a discretionary ground for possession, a possession order can only be made if the Court is satisfied that it is reasonable to make a possession order. There are many cases in which the Council proves &#8220;fraud&#8221; but the Court still declines to order possession, or makes a suspended order, in the light of the Defendant&#8217;s circumstances. </p>

The significance of this, Ms Cafferkey argued, was that the tenancy in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Chishimba</span> was unravelled by the fraud because a common law tenancy obtained by fraud is void, unlike a secure tenancy which continues and is not void by fraud.

Ms Chishimba had no legal right to accommodation given her immigration status, whereas the Appellant in this case <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> have been legally entitled to a property, subject to the findings made by the Respondent&#8217;s Homelessness Officer.</p>

It is of note that the LHA in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Chishimba</span> did in fact obtain a possession order against her. Whilst I accept the Respondent&#8217;s submission that there are differences between common law tenancies and secure tenancies in the sense of how a landlord can bring that tenancy to an end, it is a step further to assert that this means that the two classes of tenancy should be treated differently in terms of the consideration of whether the accommodation is reasonable to continue to occupy in the context of intentional homelessness. I am not satisfied that such a distinction can be drawn from the case law argued in this appeal. Furthermore, the Review Decision does not reference <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Chishimba</span> or the principle in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Chishimba</span> at all, whether to distinguish it in terms of its applicability to secure tenancies or otherwise.</p>

As in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gliddon</span>, the Respondent in this case had required the Appellant to give up possession of the Property upon discovering her deceit. When the Appellant failed to give up possession, possession proceedings were commenced and pursued by the Respondent and ultimately a warrant obtained to evict her, the Appellant opposing those steps. In those circumstances, it is difficult to see that this Court can reach a different decision to that in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gliddon</span>, namely that it was not reasonable for the Appellant to continue to occupy the Property in the face of extensive efforts made by the Respondent to evict her from it. </p>

I am not persuaded that Woolf J&#8217;s reasoning is limited to cases where the landlord has a mandatory ground for possession. I come to that view because Woolf J states that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">it is almost inevitable</span>&#8221; that if possession was sought from the landlord, it would be unreasonable for a person to continue to occupy the accommodation against the wishes of the landlord. This envisages that there may be limited circumstances where it would be reasonable to continue to occupy against the wishes of the landlord.

Miss Cafferkey deployed this case to argue that, even if the Appellant in this case was not eligible for a tenancy of the Property, that did not mean that the tenancy itself was defective, or the grant of the tenancy was ineffective; the Appellant still had a legal right to the Property. This was a decision concerning Part VI of the 1996 Act and is distinguishable on its facts. There was no suggestion in the present case that the tenancy granted to the Appellant was necessarily void because of her deception, hence why an order for possession was sought by the Respondent because the Appellant did have a valid tenancy. Just because the tenancy was valid, it does not mean that the Respondent had anything other than very good prospects of obtaining possession pursuant to Ground 5 in this case, for the reasons suggested by Lord Neuberger MR (as he then was) at [35] of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Qasim</span>.

However, I am not satisfied that the suggestion that the findings that I have made above necessarily mean that individuals such as the Appellant would gain a foothold over those who are not intentionally homeless. On the Respondent&#8217;s own findings, the Appellant was not homeless at all as she had the tenancy of the Flat. She is therefore being put back into the position she was but for the deception. If she still has the Flat, and it continues to be reasonable for her to occupy the Flat, she is not homeless and therefore does not get a foothold over those persons unintentionally homeless on the Respondent&#8217;s homeless register. If she does not have the Flat, it is not reasonable for her to continue to occupy the Flat and/or she is not intentionally homeless from the Flat, she will legitimately join the homeless register. In other words, if the present Review Decision is quashed, it is still open to the Respondent to consider the Birmingham accommodation and decide whether that accommodation remained available for the Appellant&#8217;s occupation and, if not, whether she was intentionally homeless as a result of ceasing to occupy it. </p>

Thus the court may not only quash the authority's decision under section 204(3) if it is held to be vitiated by legal misdirection or procedural impropriety or unfairness or bias or irrationality or bad faith but also if there is no evidence to support factual findings made or they are plainly untenable or (<span style="font-style:italic">Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council [1977] AC 1014, 1030</span>, per Scarman LJ) if the decision-maker is shown to have misunderstood or been ignorant of an established and relevant fact. In the present context I would expect the county court judge to be alert to any indication that an applicant's case might not have been resolved by the authority in a fair, objective and even-handed way, conscious of the authority&#8217;s role as decision-maker and of the immense importance of its decision to an applicant. But I can see no warrant for applying in this context notions of &#8220;anxious scrutiny&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Bugdaycay [1987] AC 514, 531g</span>, per Lord Bridge of Harwich) or the enhanced approach to judicial review described by Lord Steyn in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] 2 AC 532 , 546-548</span>. I would also demur at the suggestion of Laws LJ in the Court of Appeal in the present case [2002] 1 WLR 2491, 2513, para 44 that the judge may subject the decision to &#8220;a close and rigorous analysis&#8221; if by that is meant an analysis closer or more rigorous that would ordinarily and properly be conducted by a careful and competent judge determining an application for judicial review.&#8221;</p>

Although they may often be checked by people with legal experience or qualifications before they are sent out, review decisions are prepared by housing officers, who occupy a post of considerable responsibility and who have substantial experience in the housing field, but they are not lawyers. It is not therefore appropriate to subject their decisions to the same sort of analysis as may be applied to a contract drafted by solicitors, to an Act of Parliament, or to a court&#8217;s judgment.&#8221;</p>

The Review Decision did not explicitly consider the question of how, in light of Mr Walker&#8217;s findings about the Appellant&#8217;s circumstances and tenancy of the Flat, it would have been reasonable for her to continue to occupy the Property when she never had any eligibility to obtain the Property in the first place. Mr Nabi argued that there had been no sensible attempt to grapple with the principle set out in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Chishimba</span> and, had Mr Walker considered the matter, he would not have concluded that it was reasonable for the Appellant to continue to occupy the Property.

It may be said that the production of the witness statement by Mr Walker supports my finding in this regard, as it was identified that there was a gap in the Respondent&#8217;s reasoning within the Review Decision. To put matters another way, I am not satisfied that the Review Decision &#8220;stacks up&#8221; or &#8220;stands up&#8221; in light of the factual findings made about the Flat and the Appellant&#8217;s occupation of the same within the Review Decision and thus the Review Decision was reached without sufficient regard to those relevant factors.</p>

For the reasons that I set out above, the Appellant has established that this was an error of law. Even if I am wrong with my analysis that this was an error of law, insufficient reasons were given within the Review Decision and subsequently as to why it was reasonable for the Appellant to continue to occupy the Property when the Respondent actively sought to evict her from that accommodation under Ground 5 and on the basis of their own pleaded position as to her eligibility and entitlement to the Property had she been honest about her circumstances.</p>
