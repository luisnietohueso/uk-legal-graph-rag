	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Respondent in these proceedings (to which I will refer as &#8220;the School&#8221;) is a secondary school in Fairford in Gloucestershire.  At the time relevant to these proceedings the Claimant had been employed by the School for six years, latterly as a pastoral administrator and work experience manager.  In the first of those roles she was responsible for overseeing students who had been removed from class for disruptive behaviour.  She has two children, the elder of whom was a pupil at the School.  She is a Christian.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 26 October 2018 a parent at the School emailed the Head Teacher, Matthew Evans, complaining that the Claimant had expressed &#8220;homophobic and prejudiced views&#8221; on her Facebook page: I give details below.  Following an initial interview with the Claimant, on 30 October Mr Evans asked a member of staff called Sue Dorey to conduct an investigation.  The Claimant was suspended.  On the basis of Ms Dorey&#8217;s report, disciplinary charges were brought against the Claimant.  The charges were considered at a hearing on 19 December 2018 before a panel chaired by one of the governors, Stephen Conlan.  By letter dated 7 January 2019 she was summarily dismissed for gross misconduct.  An internal appeal was unsuccessful.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 15 April 2019 the Claimant began proceedings in the Employment Tribunal (&#8220;the ET&#8221;).  Although she initially raised other complaints, the complaints which eventually proceeded were of (direct) discrimination and harassment, within the meaning of sections 13 and 26 respectively of the Equality Act 2010, in both cases on the ground of religion or belief.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The claim was heard by the ET (Employment Judge Reed, Mrs England and Ms Maidment) in Bristol on 21-24 September 2020.  The Claimant was represented by Mr Pavel Stroilov, of Andrew Storch Solicitors, and the School was represented by Ms Debbie Grennan of counsel.  By a judgment sent to the parties on 6 October 2020 the Claimant&#8217;s claims of discrimination and harassment were dismissed.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal (&#8220;the EAT&#8221;).  The appeal was heard by the President, Eady J, on 16 March 2023.  The Claimant was represented by Mr Richard O&#8217;Dair of counsel and the School again by Ms Grennan.  The Archbishops&#8217; Council of the Church of England was given permission to intervene and was represented by Mrs Sarah Fraser Butlin.  By a judgment handed down on 16 June the Claimant&#8217;s appeal was allowed and the claim remitted to the ET.</p>

	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the Claimant had to that extent succeeded in her appeal, she believes that the EAT should have gone further and have held for itself that her claim succeeded; and by an Appellant&#8217;s Notice dated 7 July 2023 she appealed to this Court on that basis.  Permission to appeal was given by Elisabeth Laing LJ.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By a Respondent&#8217;s Notice dated 5 February 2024 the School sought permission to cross-appeal on the basis that, while it accepted that the claim had to be remitted, the EAT&#8217;s formulation of the question requiring determination was erroneous.  By order dated 27 March Elisabeth Laing LJ refused that permission, and she subsequently refused permission to re-open that decision.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant has again been represented before us by Mr O&#8217;Dair.  The School has been represented by Mr Sean Jones KC and Mr Christopher Milsom.  The Archbishops&#8217; Council has been permitted to intervene and has again been represented by Mrs Fraser Butlin (now KC).  Permission to intervene has also been given to the Free Speech Union Ltd (&#8220;the FSU&#8221;), the Association of Christian Teachers (&#8220;the ACT&#8221;), the charity Sex Matters, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (&#8220;the EHRC&#8221;), though in the case of all but the EHRC by written submissions only.  They have been represented by, respectively, Mr Ben Cooper KC, leading Mr Spencer Keen, Mr Roger Kiska of <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#474747;background-color:#FFFFFF">Camerons Solicitors, </span>Ms Akua Reindorf KC, and<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>Ms Joanne Clement KC.  (I should say that the EHRC&#8217;s written submissions were settled by Mr Tom Cross: Ms Clement was instructed to make the oral submissions when he fell ill, and she produced helpful short supplementary written submissions.)  I am grateful for the work and thought that went into all the submissions, written and oral.  I am also grateful for the immaculate way in which the bundles &#8211; particularly the bundles of authorities, which were voluminous &#8211; were prepared.</p>

As noted above, the investigation stage started on 30 October 2018, and in a report dated 30 November Ms Dorey found that there was a case to answer on four allegations, which I summarise below.  I need not give the full details of the report but it is important to record the substance of the Claimant&#8217;s response on the points raised.

You stressed that whilst you may not have chosen to use the same language as used in the articles, you agreed with the content and upon reflection you would not have acted differently.

You said that you were only sharing these posts with your Facebook friends, that you make no reference to working at Farmor&#8217;s on your Facebook page and use your maiden name. However, you also said that your friends know where you work, that you are a local girl, went to Farmor&#8217;s school as a child and have lived locally for years and people know you. Some of your friends are also members of staff at the school and others parents of pupils at Farmor&#8217;s. You affirmed that you were aware that your posts could be reposted and seen by others outside your immediate &#8216;Facebook Friends&#8217; group. We considered that these posts have the potential to be reposted and therefore potentially reach a far wider audience, many of whom will know you and your maiden name and where you work due to your local connections and long history in the area. Once posted, you lose a degree of control. You had also expressed your view that it was your intention to get the message across to others and you hoped it would be reposted.

You had not removed the posts.

Head (e) is perhaps literally distinct, but the Claimant&#8217;s main concern about sex education for primary school children would appear to be that it was being used as a vehicle for the inculcation of views in favour of gender fluidity and same-sex marriage.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.55in">&#8220;Religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual thought and conscience. This aspect of the right set out in the first paragraph of Article&#160;9, to hold any religious belief and to change religion or belief, is absolute and unqualified. However, as further set out in Article 9 &#167;1, freedom of religion also encompasses the freedom to manifest one&#8217;s belief, alone and in private but also to practice in community with others and in public. The manifestation of religious belief may take the form of worship, teaching, practice and observance. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions (see&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">Kokkinakis,&#160;</span>cited above, &#167;31 and also&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">Leyla &#350;ahin v. Turkey&#160;</span>[GC], no. 44774/98, &#167;105, ECHR 2005-XI,&#160;44 EHRR 5). Since the manifestation by one person of his or her religious belief may have an impact on others, the drafters of the Convention qualified this aspect of freedom of religion in the manner set out in Article 9 &#167;2. This second paragraph provides that any limitation placed on a person&#8217;s freedom to manifest religion or belief must be prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of one or more of the legitimate aims set out therein.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In that passage the Court identifies a fundamental difference between the right to hold a religious belief and the right to manifest it.  While the former is absolute, the latter is qualified by paragraph 2, which allows the right to manifest a belief to be limited if the limitation is (a) &#8220;prescribed by law&#8221; and (b) justified by reference to the other legitimate interests there specified.  It is important to appreciate the reason given for that difference.  Whereas the holding of a belief is in the nature simply of a characteristic (albeit one that is to a greater or lesser extent a matter of choice), its manifestation constitutes conduct which is outward-facing and for that reason, as the Court says, &#8220;may have an impact on others&#8221; and accordingly may require to be limited so as to take account of other interests.</p>

There has been a fair amount of exposition of the nature of that link in the case-law.  The line of cases begins with the speech of Lord Nicholls in&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">Nagarajan v London Regional Transport</span>&#160;[2000] 1 AC 501&#160;and includes the reasoning of the majority in the Supreme Court in&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">R (E) v Governing Body of the JFS</span>&#160; [2009] UKSC 15,&#160;<a href="https://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKSC/2009/15.html">[2010] 2 AC 728</a> (&#8220;the <span style="font-style:italic">JFS</span> case&#8221;).  What it refers to is &#8220;the reason why&#8221; the putative discriminator or victimiser acted in the way complained of.  In some cases that reason is inherent in the act complained of: these are often referred to as &#8220;criterion cases&#8221;.  But in others it consists in the &#8220;mental processes&#8221;, conscious or unconscious, that caused the discriminator to act, often referred to as their &#8220;motivation&#8221; (though not their &#8220;motive&#8221;).  Where convenient I will in this judgment sometimes use the phrase &#8220;on the grounds of&#8221; as an alternative to &#8220;because of&#8221;: this was the language of the predecessor legislation to the 2010 Act, as also of the EU Framework Directive referred to below, and it is recognised as having the same effect.</p>

Once the reasons for particular treatment have been identified by the fact-finding tribunal, it must evaluate whether the reasons so identified are separate from the protected disclosure, or whether they are so closely connected with it that a distinction cannot fairly and sensibly be drawn. Were this exercise not permissible, the effect would be that whistle-blowers would have immunity for behaviour or conduct related to the making of a protected disclosure no matter how bad, and employers would be obliged to ensure that they are not adversely treated, again no matter how bad the associated behaviour or conduct.&#8221;</span></p>

Also, and importantly, although it gets there by a different route (because the provisions in question are drafted in very different ways), the recognition of that distinction in the application of section 13 achieves substantially the same result as the distinction in article 9 of the Convention between the absolute right to hold a religious or other belief and the qualified right to manifest it.

But in this appeal we have received extensive and helpful submissions, both from the parties and from the interveners, exploring the basis on which <span style="font-style:italic">Page</span> was, or must be taken to have been, decided.  I believe that we should take advantage of the assistance which we have received in order to try to explain the reasoning more fully.  Anything I say will be obiter, for one or both of two reasons.

Second, even if it were otherwise open to us to reformulate that ratio, the EAT, as appears below, clearly decided the appeal by applying it and neither party has permission to challenge that aspect of its decision.

On the face of it, the protection conferred by section 13 is perfectly compatible with employees&#8217; Convention rights: it may, because it is unqualified, go further than the Convention requires, and so place additional obligations on the employer, but that is not the same thing.</p>

But that is not the only possibility.  It might be more consistent with the route taken in this paragraph to include a new subsection in section 13 containing separate provision for manifestation cases (as the existing subsections (2)-(6) do for issues peculiar to other protected characteristics).  Another alternative (advanced by Mr Cooper and Mr Keen in their written submissions on behalf of the FSU) would be to qualify the definition of &#8220;religion or belief&#8221; in section 4 so as to exclude (for short) objectionable manifestations of belief (though this might be less satisfactory because it would on the face of it deny protection against disproportionate responses to such manifestations).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The starting-point is that the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Page</span> believed that the legislature cannot have intended that an employer should be obliged to tolerate any conduct at all by an employee which constituted a manifestation of a belief, whatever form it took and whatever the circumstances; and that is reinforced by the fact that the drafters of the Convention thought it necessary to qualify the right to manifest a belief.  It is not necessary to multiply examples of cases where an inability to prohibit particular kinds of manifestation would produce an obviously unacceptable result.  One familiar case is the wearing of clothes or jewellery which would create a serious risk to health or safety at work.  Another is that of religious proselytisation at work, as illustrated by the cases noted at para. 70 above: in that connection, I note that A-G Sharpston observed at para. 73 of her Opinion in <span style="font-style:italic">Bougnaoui</span> that proselytisation &#8220;has &#8230; simply no place in the work context&#8221;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The next question is what the parameters of such a limitation should be.  The Court&#8217;s view in <span style="font-style:italic">Page</span> was that the qualification which best achieved the legislative purpose was to permit a defence of objective justification substantially corresponding to the terms of article 9.2 of the Convention.  There are a number of reasons why that should be so, even without resort to section 3 of the 1998 Act.  We have seen that the CJEU in <span style="font-style:italic">Bougnaoui</span> referred to the Convention as an aid to the construction of the Directive.  More specifically, article 2.5 of the Directive legitimises in principle a qualification reflecting the terms of article 9.2: that is significant, even though no such qualification was expressly included in the 2010 Act.  It is in fact hard to see how the presumed legislative purpose of limiting the right to manifest a religious belief to the extent necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of others could be achieved more appropriately than by the balancing exercise required under the Convention.  There is nothing to be gained by searching for some different formulation, and there are obvious practical advantages in employing a test with which practitioners and tribunals are familiar.  It would also be anomalous if, in proceedings brought by an employee of a public authority in the ordinary courts under section 7 of the 1998 Act for breach of their right under article 9 to manifest a belief, the applicable test were different from that which would apply if they brought proceedings in the ET under the 2010 Act.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It remains to identify how such a limitation could operate within the structure of the provisions of the 2010 Act.  The Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Page</span> believed, drawing on the separability case-law, that that was best done by treating it as going to the requirement of causation in section 13 (1).  That is, where the act complained of was objectively justified it should not be treated as being done &#8220;because of&#8221; the manifestation in question.</p>

It is well established, at least in EU and UK law, that direct discrimination cannot generally be justified.  That feature cannot, it is said, be circumvented by incorporating an element of objective justification into the requirement that the discrimination be &#8220;on the grounds of&#8221; the protected characteristic: it is well established that if the subjective mental processes of the putative discriminator had nothing to do with the protected characteristic they cannot be liable, however unreasonable or unfair the treatment in question may have been (see, classically, the judgment of Elias J in <span style="font-style:italic">Law Society v Bahl</span> [<span style="color:#000000">2003] UKEAT 1056/01/3107, [2003] IRLR 640, at paras. 93-101).  Likewise, in separability cases the fact that an employer&#8217;s response to some objectionable feature of the protected conduct is disproportionate is relevant only if and to the extent that it supports a finding that that was not the real reason for the impugned act: see the observations of Simler LJ in </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Kong</span><span style="color:#000000"> referred to at para. 59 above.</span></p>

And even if section 3 is not engaged, I do not in fact think that it is unanswerable.  In the first place, there is nothing axiomatically objectionable in the proposition that direct discrimination may be capable of justification: that is the case under article 14 of the Convention, and the justification of direct discrimination is also permitted by the Framework Directive in the case of age discrimination and under article 2.5.  Direct discrimination in manifestation cases is (uniquely) different from discrimination on the ground of other protected characteristics (and indeed from simple belief discrimination) because it is based, as the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Eweida</span> identifies, not on the possession of the characteristic as such but on overt conduct, which thus has the potential to impact on the interests of society and the rights and freedoms of others.  That distinction may be said to put it in a special category which requires a more flexible approach.  As I have said, I find it hard to accept that the legislature intended employees to enjoy an absolute right not to suffer any adverse treatment on the basis of conduct manifesting their religious or other beliefs, whatever the nature of that conduct and whatever the circumstances.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="8">

She drew our attention to a number of ET decisions in which it had been acknowledged to be helpful, and to an observation to the same effect in </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Harvey on Industrial Relations and Employment Law</span><span style="color:#000000">.</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000"> </span><span style="color:#000000"> Mr O&#8217;Dair and some of the other interveners, on the other hand, while not asserting that it was positively erroneous, proposed various amplifications or refinements.   Eady J herself, at para. 93, sounds a strong note of caution about the value of guidelines in this field.  I agree, and I would echo in particular her statement that the relevant principles </span>require nuanced decision-making and that there can be no one-size-fits-all approach.  But, provided para. 94 is read as being limited to, as she says, <span style="color:#000000">a summary of the underlying principles, I would respectfully endorse it.  I would only say, consistently with the caution already expressed, that it will not be necessary &#8211; or always even useful &#8211; for a tribunal to structure its reasoning by reference to the nine &#8220;considerations&#8221; enumerated in head (v).  All of them are potentially relevant; but in practice, as the EHRC observed, the focus of the issues in any given case will only be on some of them, and there may be some cases where other considerations &#8211; or considerations which do not neatly fit into her formulation &#8211; may be relevant.</span></p>

Amongst them &#8211; in the context of religious opinions and beliefs &#8211; may legitimately be included an obligation to avoid as far as possible expressions that are gratuitously offensive to others and thus an infringement of their rights, and which therefore do not contribute to any form of public debate capable of furthering progress in human affairs.&#8221;</span></p>

An employer does not have <span style="font-style:italic">carte blanche</span> to interfere with an employee&#8217;s right to express their beliefs simply because third parties find those beliefs offensive and think the worse of it for employing them.  Nor, however, does the employee have <span style="font-style:italic">carte blanche</span> about what they can say in public or how, or in what circumstances, they say it.  The characteristics of the employment relationship may entitle the employer to impose limitations on the employee&#8217;s rights to manifest their beliefs and of free expression in accordance with articles 9.2 and 10.2 of the Convention.  The particular characteristic with which we are concerned here is the employer&#8217;s legitimate interest in protecting its reputation &#8211; not only with customers or consumers or users of its services, but also with other third parties, including other employees, whose perception of it may affect its work or business.  The extent to which it will be justified in interfering with the employee&#8217;s article 9 or article 10 rights will depend on the circumstances, and it is not possible to give any kind of general exposition.  For present purposes I need only note three considerations which will be relevant to the proportionality of any such interference.</p>

First, he found that, although his Facebook page did identify his work, there was no risk that any reader would understand his views to be those of the trust.  Second, even if the views that he expressed had the propensity to upset fellow-employees or customers of the trust who read them that did not constitute the bringing of it into disrepute.

That, like &#8220;homophobic&#8221; itself, is a rather imprecise term, the meaning of which may be affected by the context, but fortunately all that matters for our purposes is that the complainant meant to describe an attitude on the part of the Claimant towards gay people that might lead her to treat them differently. The complainant did not in terms also describe the Claimant as being &#8220;transphobic&#8221;, but it seems from paras. 15-16 above that Ms Dorey and/or the Claimant herself understood that to be part of the case against her.  </p>

Rather, it was an assumption that anyone who expressed the protected beliefs must be homophobic or transphobic.  He submitted that there was no basis for such an assumption.  Holding gender-critical beliefs, or believing that same-sex marriage is not equivalent to traditional marriage, cannot be equated with an animus against gay or trans people.

In context, the description of the promoters of gender fluidity as &#8220;the LGBT crowd&#8221; does not appear to be primarily intended to incite hatred or disgust for homosexuals or trans people.  Rather, it is one of a series of derogatory sneers, alongside &#8220;liberal school systems&#8221; and &#8220;far-left zealots&#8221;.  The accusations of &#8220;child abuse&#8221; and the promotion of mental illness may be stupidly rhetorical exaggeration but they are not likely to be taken literally.

Any reputational damage would only take the form of the fear expressed by the complainant, namely that the Claimant might express at work the homophobic and transphobic attitudes arguably implicit in the language used.  I accept that if that belief became widespread it could harm the School&#8217;s reputation in the community, as the panel clearly thought.  But the risk of widespread circulation was speculative at best.  The posts were made on her personal Facebook account, in her maiden name and with no reference to the School.  By the time of the hearing, several weeks after the posts were made, only one person was known to have recognised who she was.</span></p>

This view was obviously central to its decision to dismiss.  I accept that in an appropriate case lack of insight may justify an employer in choosing dismissal rather than a less severe sanction; but there can be no universal rule.  There are understandable reasons why in some cases an employee may not be willing to admit that the conduct in question was wrong, or seriously wrong, particularly if it was the manifestation of a deeply-held belief.  If the case is not one that would otherwise justify dismissal, it is hard that it should be marked up in seriousness because of a failure to make an acknowledgement of fault which the employee would genuinely find difficult.  The position may be different where the employer needs to be confident that the employee understands what they have done wrong in order to prevent a more serious or damaging occurrence of the same conduct in the future; but for the reasons already given this was not that kind of case.  </p>

I have no doubt that the School was entitled to carry out an investigation of some kind in response to the complaint.  The posts unquestionably used offensive language, even if it was evidently not the Claimant&#8217;s own, and they had been seen by, and caused concern to, at least one parent who knew that she worked at the School.  It would frankly have been irresponsible not to try to ascertain whether there was a risk of serious reputational damage or of the Claimant &#8220;bringing into school&#8221; the issues that she raised in the posts or holding attitudes that might affect how she treated gay or trans children.  It is debatable whether that investigation needed to be disciplinary in character or, if it did, whether Ms Dorey was justified in finding a case to answer at the end of it.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to ground 3, the significance of the Claimant&#8217;s case based on unlawful stereotyping is that if it were established it would, at least as Mr O&#8217;Dair submitted, bypass any defence of objective justification because the complainant, and through them the School, would have been shown to be motivated, at least to a significant extent, not by the language of the posts, or any other separable feature, but directly by the beliefs expressed in them.  This submission was not addressed in the oral submissions, but I am inclined to think that it is analytically correct.  But I am not satisfied that it would be right for this Court to make findings on the complainant&#8217;s motivation, or on the issue of whether it was adopted by the School, particularly since this analysis was not considered by the ET and not fully addressed in the oral submissions before us.  There is no advantage in our wrestling with an issue which is far from straightforward and cannot lead to a different finding than we have already made on grounds 1 and 2.</p>

In such a case, although the reason for the treatment given by the employer is not the protected characteristic, it is nonetheless positively relied on by the claimant. The claimant argues that the decision-maker has, consciously or unconsciously, adopted a stereotype and was significantly influenced by it in deciding on the treatment complained of i.e. on the basis that the claimant would share the perceived attributes of the group, rather than relying on evidence about the particular individual. If that is so then the treatment will be &#8216;because of&#8217; the protected characteristic. It does not matter if the stereotype is very likely to be true: see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">R (European Roma Rights Centre) v Immigration Officer at Prague Airport</span> &#8230; [2005] 2 AC 1 per Lady Hale at &#167;82; <span style="font-style:italic">Commerzbank AG v Rajput</span> UKEAT/154/18 [2019] ICR 1613 &#8230; at &#167;77 per Soole J. </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.55in;text-indent:0.02in">In relation to religion or belief, a decision-maker will accordingly discriminate where the reason given for the treatment is significantly influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by a stereotype that persons who hold or manifest the relevant belief will share attributes of a group which they might not in fact possess. Examples of stereotypes in relation to religion or belief explicitly recognised in the case law are that: persons who hold/manifest certain gender-critical beliefs have animus towards trans persons (see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">R (Miller) v College of Policing</span> [2020] EWHC 225 (Admin) [2020] 4 All ER 31 at &#167;&#167;250, 281); or that persons holding/manifesting the belief that same-sex sexual activity is sinful have animus towards gay persons (see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Ngole</span> at &#167;115). It may be that some persons who hold/manifest such beliefs have such animus, but it is stereotyping to assume that all do. Given the above cases, the EHRC considers that a Tribunal is likely to be able to proceed on the basis that the stereotypes which they identify exist (<span style="font-style:italic">Commerzbank</span>, &#167;&#167;79-80), although it may need to give prior notice to the parties of a proposed use of the principle: ibid., &#167;84.</p>

However, neither the language of the posts nor the risk of reputational damage were capable of justifying the Claimant&#8217;s dismissal in circumstances where she had not said anything of the kind at work or displayed any discriminatory attitudes in her treatment of pupils: see paras. 159-163 above.    </span></p>

While this will, as he notes, include necessary implications, it must be emphasised that the test is an objective one. In other words, what meaning do the words used actually have? What message would they convey to a reasonable reader? In the event of a dispute, this will be a matter that the tribunal must decide for itself. </p>

Rather, it accepted that the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">School</span> felt that the posts could reasonably lead someone to conclude that the Claimant held certain views. This is understandable because the ET was focusing only on the School&#8217;s motivation. But it highlights a real concern that arises from such an approach. Namely, that if unchecked it would risk a judicially-endorsed silencing of the legitimate expression of views due to a concern about the conclusions that some might choose to draw from what is said, even if an impartial tribunal would not agree that the conclusions could reasonably be drawn and would also recognise the force of the point that freedom of speech entails the freedom to express opinions that may offend.</p>

Speaking for myself, I find &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; the more helpful term, for two reasons. First, it reduces the risk of the words &#8220;to which objection could justifiably be taken&#8221; being incorrectly read as permitting regard to be paid to the risk that some readers might wrongly read what is said in a way that a reasonable reader would not. Secondly, it more obviously conveys that the forum and context for what is said is relevant, as well as the content and manner. For example, something that might be unproblematic on a private Facebook page could justify different treatment if communicated in a work setting.</p>
