The Appellant referred to the Bartlett report which was published on 9 June 2022 following an Environmental Investigation into UCL&#8217;s Bartlett School of Architecture. The Bartlett report identified a culture of bullying, harassment, discrimination and sexual misconduct over years and following its publication, several staff were subject to further investigations. The Appellant claimed that the publication of the Bartlett Report provided accountability and transparency and triggered an apology from UCL, and action being taken against staff. He claims that the converse is true in respect of the Report which he argues should be disclosed &#8220;for scrutiny, transparency, accountability and holding senior managers to account&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

The Appellant claims that individuals either chose not to participate in the Environmental Investigation or to limit their contributions to the investigation for fear of victimisation and losing their jobs. In response, the Commissioner submits that the perceived impact of the Director&#8217;s email is acknowledged in the Report and at the relevant time, 2 July 2022, SSEES staff had voluntarily participated in the Environmental Investigation and, having been reassured of anonymity, shared their experiences on sensitive issues with the investigator. Accordingly, the Commissioner was right to accept UCL&#8217;s submission that if the Report were disclosed in July 2022, it would be likely to adversely affect UCL&#8217;s processes by deterring staff from participating in any future Environmental Investigations of this nature.</span></p>

Further, the Tribunal is to consider the application of the exemptions and the public interest test where relevant, in the circumstances as they existed at the time of that UCL&#8217;s response was required by law (2 July 2022 per &#167;43 of the Commissioner&#8217;s Response). Ultimately, the Tribunal is concerned with the potential disclosure of the entire Report to the world under FOIA in circumstances where UCL considered that the full report is not suitable for publication.&#8221;</span></p>

I contend that this decision was erroneous and failed to appropriately weigh the public interest in disclosure against the cited exemptions. The EI report addresses systemic misconduct at a publicly funded institution, including allegations of bullying, discrimination, and managerial failures. These failings have caused significant harm to staff well-being and morale and undermine UCL&#8217;s obligations as a public institution. Transparency is essential to ensure accountability and rebuild trust. Contrary to UCL&#8217;s claims, the public interest in exposing this systemic failure far outweighs speculative concerns about inhibiting future deliberations.</span></p>

The QP&#8217;s view that this prejudice would be likely to arise can hardly be called irrational, even in July 2022, when the very fact of the Request, and especially the highly adversarial e-mail containing the Request, demonstrated that the issues raised in the Report were still controversial &#8211; certainly in the view of the Appellant.

Thus, there are numerous instances where the investigator expresses himself in vivid and direct language, for example at [</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">CB/C19</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">]. The use of blander language, with an eye to publication, would not convey the situation at SSEES so effectively to those reading such reports, and so would reduce the imperative to act to improve matters. Further, the Report is candid in reporting negative feedback about senior individuals: Section A(iv) [</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">CB/C24</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">] summarises what the investigator was told about CH and DK in a frank and unguarded way. These comments are critical in conveying to the reader an accurate picture of the perceptions of junior staff about senior management at SSEES &#8211; a central theme the investigator was tasked with exploring. Again, if this Report were disclosed, a future investigator would be wary about recording similar comments in a report that was not intended for publication, given the precedent set by such disclosure.</span></p>

A civil servant carrying out their regular, constitutional role of advising a Minister on issues of public policy may well be expected to advise candidly, setting aside any concern about public pressure. However, that is a very different situation to that of an individual at an academic institution, tasked (outside of their ordinary role) with investigating the conduct of (potentially senior) colleagues. Such a person may understandably be rather more prone to be swayed by concerns about the effects of disclosure.</span></p>

The Report quotes or paraphrases extensively from these interviewees, and given the small size of SSEES, and the specific nature of some of the comments made, their identities would be apparent in many cases to those familiar with the workings of SSEES. If the interviewees felt that the assurances they were given turned out to be hollow, because the Report was later disclosed to the world at large, then interviewees in any future investigation would be much more circumspect when providing input on sensitive matters &#8211; or would not come forward at all.</span></p>

The public interest in avoiding such an outcome is clear: it would be harder for senior management to obtain a frank and detailed view of difficult workplace situations, and it would therefore be harder for management to address them. Ultimately, that would have a detrimental effect on the quality of research and teaching at SSEES. That would be strongly contrary to the public interest, for a publicly- funded institution with a reputation for excellence in its field that enhances the UK&#8217;s standing in the academic world.&#8221;</span></p>

The FTT should give significant weight to his view that disclosure would impede the process of improving working relationships within SSEES. It can in any case be seen from the documentary evidence that disclosure to the world on 2 July 2022 would have had a detrimental effect on the ability of UCL and SSEES to improve the working culture within SSEES. This is, quite simply, because it would have led to the Appellant (whose intentions are clear from the wider e-mail containing the Request), and potentially others, raking over perceived historical wrongs, dating back to the period 2017-2020. That would have been overwhelmingly negative for relationships within SSEES, at a time when (i) SSEES had taken significant steps to address the Report&#8217;s recommendations by means of open discussion and staff training; (ii) CH (on whom the Appellant&#8217;s grievances focus) had left some time before; and (iii) SSEES had separately investigated and dealt with the Appellant&#8217;s complaints, as they related specifically to him, through appropriate HR procedures. There comes a time when any institution is entitled to draw a line under past controversies and focus on improving relationships and behaviours going forwards. For SSEES, that time had plainly come by 2 July 2022. In this sense, disclosure would have impinged on the &#8216;safe space&#8217; required by SSEES to implement the recommendations and focus on improving the working culture. That would have been detrimental to the public interest, because a healthy working culture is strongly in the public interest.&#8221;</span></p>

In summary, those reports concerned allegations by students of inappropriate behaviour, including discrimination or harassment on the basis of sex and race. There was therefore an especially strong public interest in their publication, both because of overt allegations of discrimination had been made, and because they concerned UCL&#8217;s public-facing role in teaching students. It was obvious that a public response was required to such allegations, and accordingly the relevant reports were prepared from the outset with the intention of publication. By contrast, the Report concerned internal working culture of a department, and while themes of race and sex discrimination arose in interviews, they were not its focus. There is a far lower public interest in scrutiny of internal working practices, even if they happen to arise at a public institution, than there is in addressing allegations of discrimination in how an institution delivers a public service.</span></p>

In short, the Imperial report concerned allegations against staff who were extremely senior within the university overall (the President and CFO), generating such significant public interest that questions had been asked in Parliament [</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">OB/A12</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> &#182;5]. Crucially, the Imperial report had made findings of fact against these individuals, and the university had subsequently given them its strong backing, after publishing only parts of the investigation report. There was therefore an exceptionally strong public interest in publication of the full report, to understand the extent of the findings against these individuals. By contrast, the Report was not intended to, and does not, make findings of fact about individuals [</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">CB/C21</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">].

A further important difference (albeit relevant to the public interest in maintaining the exemption), is that the identities of Imperial witnesses could effectively be protected, as they were drawn from a pool of 20,000 employees; whereas the much smaller size of SSEES meant that interviewees could still realistically be identified even if their names were redacted.</span></p>

When the question is properly framed in that way, it is submitted that the public interest in disclosure of the Report is relatively modest. It concerns the internal working culture of a small department of a university; it does not make findings of fact about individuals, and although it reports allegations against senior staff of SSEES, the primary focus of those allegations (CH) had left before the Report was even completed. There can be no credible allegation that the Report, or SSEES, ducked the question of how to address CH&#8217;s behaviour &#8211; it was simply that he left before appropriate action could be taken.</span></p>

The context of the Interviews carried out for the purpose of an environmental investigation is similar to the example given in the Commissioner&#8217;s guidance, of an employee giving evidence to a disciplinary hearing. While the wider background in both cases is, of course, the employment setting, the employee is not imparting information that is germane to their ordinary employment; rather they are giving personal reflections about matters that have gone wrong and are therefore by definition outside the ordinary course of employment.

Indeed, the nervousness of potential interviewees is a matter that the Appellant has repeatedly emphasised, and the Tribunal has been shown a number of examples in both closed and open session. Contrary to the Appellant&#8217;s oral submissions on the gist of the closed session (by reference to [OB/195]), repeated in his written closing submissions, interviewees&#8217; concerns about repercussions do not relate solely to CH and DK &#8211; as the Tribunal saw in closed session (by reference to [CB/485-487] and [CB/138-139]). The picture UCL submit is more mixed than the Appellant would have the Tribunal believe. In relation to (1), the Appellant emphasised that all UCL employees are given FOIA training and will be aware that information can be requested under FOIA. That is of course true, but FOIA training also explains to employees the operation of FOIA exemptions. It remains the case that the Investigator would not have expected disclosure beyond the commissioning manager and senior management of SSEES, as plainly evidenced in the Terms of Reference, and investigators in future would be likely to react to disclosure by being more circumspect in their reports. Unlike impartial civil servants giving advice on matters of policy, investigators in future environmental investigations will be employees of UCL, whose reports will deal with sensitive matters, usually concerned with the conduct of colleagues, and potentially (as here) senior colleagues. It is unrealistic to expect that an investigator in such a position would be wholly uninfluenced by the prospect that a report would be likely to be disclosed. Even if the inhibition were relatively subtle, it would reduce the value of the report, because it would not convey such a full or clear picture of the matter under investigation. That is a significant disbenefit to the public interest, because it reduces UCL&#8217;s ability to investigate and correct problematic situations. As to (3), it is clear from the lengthy, hostile e-mail in which the Appellant made the Request that he did not, in 2022, regard the issues discussed in the Report as concluded, despite the departure of CH, and despite UCL&#8217;s significant efforts to hold open conversations and training with SSEES staff and to improve the working culture (see UCL Skeleton of 6 December 2024 @paras.29-30). Disclosure of the Report and/or Interviews is likely to lead to further time-consuming and distracting conversations about historical matters, to the detriment of efforts being made at SSEES to improve the working environment in future.</span></p>

However, it would still arise to some extent, because disclosure would represent a breach of the expectations of the Investigator and interviewees about how the report would be treated. Moreover, these are the same elements for which the public interest in disclosure is weakest &#8211; because they deal with more anodyne procedural or background matters. In UCL&#8217;s submission, while the weight on both sides of the scales is reduced in such cases, in all cases the balance remains in favour of maintaining the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/36/section/36" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.36</ref> exemptions, because the prejudice from releasing any part of the Report remains real and of substance &#8211; and those cases where it is least significant are those cases where the public interest in disclosure is all but non-existent.</span></p>

The Appellant rightly withdrew his allegations that it had made findings of racism or corruption, and UCL is grateful to him for doing so.</span></p>

That is, strictly, correct, but the two instances where the report makes reference to &#8216;misleading information&#8217; are in the nature of misunderstandings of technical matters, not deliberate or sinister attempts by one body within UCL to mislead another:</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">a). The first instance relates to the renewal of the UCL-wide Athena Swann accreditation. The COIR report found that SMT were given &#8216;misleading information&#8217; about the impact on funding applications [OB/330]. The way in which it was &#8216;misleading&#8217; is explained at [OB/334] &#8211; the National Institute for Health and Care Research (&#8220;NIHR&#8221; &#8211; a major funder for UCL research) requires recipients of grant funding to hold a silver Athena Swann award. However, that requirement relates to the &#8216;academic setting&#8217; of the applicant. SMT were informed that the &#8216;academic setting&#8217; was UCL itself; as the COIR report explains, that was incorrect: &#8216;academic setting&#8217; is defined by NIHR to mean &#8216;faculty&#8217; or &#8216;medical school&#8217; [OB/335] &#8211; and so it was sufficient for applicant departments to hold accreditation. There is no suggestion that SMT was deliberately misled, and the result was an additional exercise in equality and diversity that might not have been agreed (due to its cost) had this mistake not occurred. Given the Appellant&#8217;s strong focus on promoting equality and diversity, it is hard to see why he complains about this mistake</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">.</span></p>

The second and only other instance in which the COIR report refers to &#8216;misleading&#8217; information concerns a somewhat arcane point about the scope of powers delegated to UCL&#8217;s Academic Committee (&#8220;AC&#8221;) by its Academic Board (&#8220;AB&#8221;). It is set out below so that the Tribunal can satisfy itself that (1) there is no suggestion of deliberate misleading and (2) the issue is one of no conceivable relevance to the present Appeal. The COIR report author records (at [OB/371] that he was told the following by a member of the Provost&#8217;s office:</span></p>

This confuses two matters: i) what Council can charge a body (given the powers it already has delegated to it) and ii) who decides that those powers are delegated in the first place. The latter is purely in the discretion of the Academic Board &#8211; no Charter or Statute provision allows for the intervention in the powers/rights of AB by another body and indeed Charter Article 7 explicitly makes clear that the powers of Council are &#8216;subject to the powers of the Academic Board&#8217;. Thus, Council is not the deciding power on extent and duration of this delegation, AB is and Council must respect that discretion [&#8230;]&#8221;</span></p>
