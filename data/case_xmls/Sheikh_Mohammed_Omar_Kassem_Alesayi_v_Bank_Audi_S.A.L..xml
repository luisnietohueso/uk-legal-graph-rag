By a letter dated 5 September 2022, the Bank refused to comply with the transfer request. The respondent states that he is a consumer domiciled in the UK and has a consumer contract for banking services with the appellant. As such, and because, he maintains, the appellant directed banking services to the UK, he is entitled to serve the appellant out of the jurisdiction as of right. He seeks, as a matter of Lebanese law, a mandatory order (specific performance) from this court requiring the appellant to transfer the full USD balances from Lebanon to his nominated accounts in Geneva.</span></p>

This has been characterised vividly by the claimant as the defendant&#8217;s fighting &#8220;tooth and nail&#8221; approach.

The end point is the disclosure orders as they now stand, a materially and importantly different matter. If one asks the simple question which party succeeded overall at first instance once one considers the appeal-adjusted order, the only plausible answer is the claimant. That is because there was intense and intensive disputation about the principle of disclosure. The claimant prevailed. But if Master Armstrong had assessed the degree of success on the basis of the corrected order, there must be a reduction from what he determined. I do not regard the appropriate level of reduction as being &#8220;small&#8221;.  That is an overly optimistic submission by the claimant. The Master would have considered that to a substantial extent the disclosure orders sought had been refused or reversed. Nevertheless, a restricted but important residue remains. </span></p>

While understanding the thrust of the submission, I have strived to avoid impression and approach the matter rationally to the extent possible.  Part 44 envisions justifiable departures from the general rule where the succeeding party has not succeeded on everything. The claimant recognises this, inevitably, given the terms of CPR 44.2(4)(b). It is a matter of the court&#8217;s discretion, permitting the award of &#8220;a proportion&#8221; of the costs under CPR 44.2(6).  </span></p>

However, while there has been overreach by the claimant in scope, he was correct to persist in his application for disclosure faced with the implacability of the defendant who &#8220;refused to give any disclosure&#8221; (as the claimant puts it). The defendant contended that disclosure would constitute &#8220;a dangerous precedent&#8221; (skeleton argument below, para 1). Indeed, the defendant asserted that disclosure should be &#8220;a matter for the Rules Committee&#8221; (ibid., para 17) and not the court. That was plainly wrong. Moreover, the defendant in correspondence stated in forceful terms that the disclosure application was &#8220;ill-advised and [it] would seek indemnity costs&#8221;.

Further, I previously found that the Master&#8217;s erroneous orders reflected the extravagant and unjustified breadth of disclosure sought by the claimant that was contrary to the approach to Part 11 jurisdiction disclosure.

While the defendant bank challenges jurisdiction as is its right, it is in no one&#8217;s interests to be mired in protracted Byzantine interlocutory skirmishes.

The deprecated level of costs has now been reached on just the disclosure proceedings ancillary to such a hearing. It is of note that the Judge ordered a &#8220;disclosure statement&#8221;.

The significance was obvious: if the defendant&#8217;s analysis were correct, none of the orders should have been made because the case lacked the necessary hallmarks of &#8220;exceptionality&#8221;.  However, as explained in detail in Part One of my previous judgment, that submission was incorrect. However, it was not an irrational or unreasonable submission to make. It was not bound to fail.  It required careful legal analysis tracing the dominant themes in disparate authorities across years, indeed decades, to arrive at the correct answer.  The defendant relied on comments from Lord Briggs in the Supreme Court. That was not an unreasonable thing to do.  However, those comments were obiter.  Furthermore, I judge that the Master&#8217;s legal analysis at first instance, although ultimately expressing the correct legal test, did not sufficiently engage with the essence of the legal dispute between the parties on this important topic. It can be readily seen why the defendant sought to relitigate the point on appeal, although it failed in the end on the applicable test. </span></p>

There were in excess of 100 customers and 1695 documents extending to around 6000 pages of documentation. This exercise was properly undertaken by the defendant because the claimant refused to agree a stay pending appeal. This seems accepted by the claimant (see skeleton argument for consequentials below at para 34). This is undoubtedly a matter for the court to take into account, but one cannot simply read across from that figure and arrive at 70 per cent as the appropriate award, and the defendant certainly does not invite so simplistic an analysis.  I judge it as fair to the claimant to reduce the defendant&#8217;s award to reflect that he succeeded on the legal test, which was a central and time-consuming area of contestation.  However, his success on that issue did not prevent the defendant from very significantly narrowing the scope of disclosure and wiping away most of the individual disclosure orders made below.  </span></p>

However, this was one route to challenging the disclosure orders made, albeit the comprehensive solution sought by the defendant.  The other route resulted in significant appellate success for the defendant while not eradicating disclosure altogether.  Exercising the court&#8217;s wide discretion, I judge that the correct figure for costs to be awarded to the defendant is 65 per cent of its appeal costs.</span></p>

However, I find no good reason for the payment on account not to be paid to the defendant directly in the usual fashion. These are proceedings in the United Kingdom. It is not appropriate to make orders affecting the balances of the subject accounts in Lebanon (alternatives 1 and 2), nor for their payment into an escrow account (alternative 3). The simple point about the risk of capital controls is that beyond assertion, there is no reliable or authoritative evidence of impending capital controls. Further, the Bank has paid the interim order granted in the Armstrong order. Presently, there is no evidence to credibly suggest it would not do so again in future.  In such circumstances, having the sums held in escrow is, to my mind, certainly not &#8220;fairer&#8221;. </span></p>
