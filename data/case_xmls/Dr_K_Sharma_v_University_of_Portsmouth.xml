In 2015, she was appointed to the role of Associate Head of Subject Group in Organisational Studies and Human Resources Management.  This was a five-year secondment from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020.  In October 2020, in anticipation of the end of the five-year term, this post was advertised and Dr Sharma and two others applied.  Her application was unsuccessful and a Ms Collier got the job.</p>

The allegations of race discrimination were based on her Indian heritage and they comprised various complaints about how she had been treated, in the main by her head of department Professor Gary Rees.  In a detailed 67-page judgment, the ET upheld all of Dr Sharma&#8217;s complaints of direct race discrimination, principally on the basis that Professor Rees had been significantly influenced by race in the treatment of her of which she complained.  The claims which were upheld were set out at the beginning of the ET&#8217;s Liability Judgment as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The nature of the grounds of appeal is such that it is not necessary to say a great deal about the legal framework which is, in any event, very well-established.  Dr Sharma&#8217;s appeal does not challenge the ET&#8217;s self-directions of law.  Rather, the essential nature of the grounds is that the ET failed to take into account relevant considerations and/or reached certain findings on the basis of flawed reasoning.  Counsel&#8217;s skeleton arguments therefore make barely any reference to the law applicable to the calculation of compensation for discrimination. </p>

Approaching the matter in this way, argues Mr Smith, it is clear that the ET cannot have been finding that the appointment of Dr Sharma would have been inevitable if Professor Rees had flagged up the advertisement to her.  It is clear that the ET had no issue with the post being advertised or with all staff being notified of the vacancy by email.  The ET directed itself correctly and had all of the relevant points in mind.  These included the statistical evidence as to the likelihood of an incumbent being reappointed, but the ET&#8217;s clear view was that this was not a case in which Dr Sharma was guaranteed reappointment and the ET&#8217;s calculations of her loss of earnings proceeded accordingly.</p>

On the face of paragraphs 170 to 172 of the Liability Judgment, there also appears to be a powerful argument that the logic of the ET&#8217;s own position was that Dr Sharma would inevitably have been appointed had she not been discriminated against in the manner found by the ET at paragraph 1.7 given that she would have been the only candidate and there was no reason why she would not be appointed.

But it did not.  The ET did not address this issue at all in the Remedy Judgment and the findings of the ET in the Liability and Remedy Judgments on which Mr Smith relies were all made on the assumption, without any reasoning, that there would have been a competitive process in any event.  It is not apparent from the ET&#8217;s reasons that it was aware that it was making this assumption, and why this should be assumed is not explained.</p>

I see the force of the argument that this is the logic of paragraphs 170 to 172 of the Liability Judgment but I note that these paragraphs appear in a section of the Liability Judgment which deals with those of Dr Sharma&#8217;s complaints which found favour at paragraphs 1.8 to 1.10 rather than 1.7.  As Mr Kohanzad himself points out, the ET did not specifically address the consequences at paragraph 1.7.</p>

As I read paragraph 120 of the Liability Judgment, that did not happen in this case until the deadline for applications expired and no one had applied.  It is not my function to make a finding on this but, on the face of the ET&#8217;s findings, it appears possible that if the University&#8217;s general practice had been followed, an email would have been sent when the post was first advertised and there would have been three applicants in any event whether or not Professor Rees had specifically spoken to Dr Sharma about the advertisement. I do not say that this is the answer which the ET gave or that it necessarily is the answer which the ET would give, particularly when the findings at paragraphs 170 to 172 of the Liability Judgment are taken into account. But I have concluded that this is not a case in which, on the face of the ET&#8217;s reasons, there is only one answer, such that I am in a position to substitute my own view.</p>

By this he meant that all that it was permissible to do, based on well-established principles, is simply to take the discrimination out of the equation.  It would not be necessary for the ET to posit a fair, as opposed to a non-discriminatory, process. I do not agree that in adopting the approach which I have taken, I am &#8220;overstepping the counterfactual&#8221; or reaching conclusions which are inconsistent with established principle.  The effect of my conclusion is no more than that the outcome, had Professor Rees spoken to Dr Sharma about the advertisement when it was about to be published or shortly after it had been published, is unclear on the ET&#8217;s findings.  That being so, in my view, the question should be remitted to the ET when it can consider submissions of the nature that Mr Kohanzad made as to the correct legal approach, and the consequences if that approach is applied to the evidence in the present case.  That will be the role of the ET as the factfinder. </p>

He had been unsupportive of this idea, as he had been on previous occasions when she raised it.  The ET found that this was in contrast to his treatment of a white colleague to whom he had been unhesitatingly supportive and encouraging, and whose application form he had signed off without even reading it.

The assessments of the two other members of the panel, as the ET noted, were not tainted by discrimination.  There is, in my judgment, therefore nothing surprising about the ET&#8217;s decision that there was a 50 per cent chance that the casting vote would have gone in favour of the other candidate absent discrimination by Professor Rees.  Moreover, and importantly, that finding was expressly based &#8220;on the evidence which we have before us&#8221; (see paragraph 303 of the Remedy Judgment) rather than being based simply on reasoning from the fact that there were two front runners. </p>

It shows that the ET very much had in mind the potential importance of the statistical evidence to this particular issue.  The two judgments of the ET should be read together and not on the basis that the ET may have forgotten its earlier findings.  When the two judgments are read together, it seems to me clear that whilst the ET&#8217;s initial provisional view was as set out in paragraph 373 of its Liability Judgment, that view was expressly a provisional view and one to which the ET said it would return at the date of the remedy decision.  That it did, and it received further argument from the parties.  It was, in my judgment, entirely consistent with that approach for the ET ultimately to come to the conclusion which it reached.  In my judgment, the ET&#8217;s treatment of these statistical evidence in coming to that conclusion was not such as to enable or to cause me to allow the appeal on Ground 2.</p>

Moreover, there was no finding by the ET that Ms Collier was not appointable, or did not have the necessary competencies to perform the role.  On the contrary, the ET found that she was a strong candidate.  The University&#8217;s case was based on her performing better in the interview.  Disclosure of the application forms therefore would have made little or no difference to the ET&#8217;s analysis and nor could any inference be drawn from a failure to disclose these forms.

Nor, more generally, does the ET appear to place any reliance at the remedy stage on the findings in the Liability Judgment in relation to documentation and its criticisms in relation to feedback provided to Dr Sharma as to why she was selected. If, as the ET found, the candidates were closely matched, it would have been open to the Tribunal to consider whether the panel might have decided to look beyond their performance in interview and to consider their application forms.  Moreover, it would have been open to the Tribunal to consider the question whether the reasons why Professor Rees, in particular, was apparently reluctant to create or provide documentation in relation to the decision that was taken included a desire not to disclose, for example, that the two other candidates were significantly weaker on paper than Dr Sharma.  </p>

That reconsideration or the reconsideration of that issue, I make clear, should be a reconsideration.  In other words, the ET should consider the question afresh taking into account all of the evidence which it received, including statistical evidence and considering whether any inferences should be drawn from the ET&#8217;s findings and Dr Sharma&#8217;s arguments about the disclosure or otherwise of relevant documentation.</p>

The ET specifically referred to these matters in its Liability Judgment and, indeed, it referred to these matters at paragraphs 309, 311, 314, and 322 of the Remedy Judgment (cited above).  However, the ET permissibly decided that it could not assume that Dr Sharma&#8216;s future competitors for promotion would be weaker candidates than her.  It did not even know who they would be. It therefore took the only sensible course which was open to it on the evidence, or at least an approach which was permissible, which was to assume that other candidates would be equally well qualified, that is, to approach the matter on an all things being equal basis.</p>

It did not simply accept the joint position of Dr Gupta and Dr Mallett, or, indeed, the position of either of them in full.  The ET found on the evidence that with appropriate treatment over a two-year period, by the end of 2025 Dr Sharma would be able to start looking for work with a different employer, albeit not at her previous academic level.  She would then need to work part-time for at least 18 months and it would then be likely that she could return to the workplace in a post equivalent to a Grade 8 post.  That would be by the end of 2027.  That conclusion, in my judgment, was entirely consistent with the interpretation of the joint experts&#8217; report suggested by Mr Kohanzad.</p>

I take Mr Kohanzad&#8217;s point that Dr Mallett had said that Dr Sharma would not return to &#8220;what she describes as her previous upward trajectory&#8221; but the ET&#8217;s findings were not describing the trajectory which Dr Sharma would have been on had there being no discrimination, or, indeed, her previous upward trajectory.  They were describing a trajectory which was significantly different as a result of the discrimination to which she had been subjected.  In my judgment, then, the ET&#8217;s findings on this issue were entirely consistent with the joint experts&#8217; report and the position of Dr Mallett who did not, in terms, rule out any further progress for Dr Sharma once she was in a Grade 8 job.  On its face, his position was that this was the level to which she was likely to return and that is what the ET found.</p>

In her pleaded case before the ET, Dr Sharma made a number of claims of discrimination based on criticisms of the University&#8217;s handling of her grievance which she had raised in relation to her treatment.  These claims included complaints about delays and failures to process the grievance in the timescales indicated in the University&#8217;s grievance procedure.  There were also claims based on failure to provide Dr Sharma with notes of the selection process and with notes requested of the selection panel.  In the course of the liability hearing, Dr Sharma said that she did not consider these claims in relation to the grievance process to be complaints of race discrimination, although she said that they were complaints about the University&#8217;s treatment of her.  She indicated that the only complaint which was pursued as a claim was a claim for victimisation in respect of the refusal to provide her with the notes of the selection process.  The other claims were therefore dismissed upon withdrawal.  The remaining complaint of victimisation was ultimately upheld by the ET.</p>

These were set out at paragraphs 40 and 41 of her witness statement.  There were ten particulars of unreasonable delays and other failures of the grievance process, and there was an overarching complaint that this was a sham investigation which breached Dr Sharma&#8217;s right to receive reasonable and prompt redress for her grievances.  However, Mr Smith submitted, and at paragraph 54 of the Remedy Judgment the ET accepted, that the only issue in relation to the ACAS uplift was as to the impact of the ET&#8217;s finding of victimisation in relation to the grievance.  Whilst Dr Sharma had brought a number of other claims in relation to the grievance process, they had been dismissed upon withdrawal.  The ET went on to award an uplift of 10 per cent which was to be applied to 25 per cent of its awards for injury to feelings and psychiatric injury.</p>

Mr Smith does not contest the point that Dr Sharma&#8217;s complaints about delay were potentially relevant but he said, at least in writing, that the submission which he had made to the ET was correct and that the ET was right, or at least entitled, to accept it.

With respect, this was an error of law.  Whilst it could only award compensation for claims which it upheld, the question of the ACAS uplift to such compensation includes consideration of any failures to comply with the ACAS Code whether or not those failures (whether individually or collectively) amounted to freestanding acts of discrimination of victimisation.  As <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/207" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 207</ref>A makes clear, all that is required is that the failures are unreasonable.

There must be a very real and very human desire to attempt to reach the same result if only on the basis of a natural wish to say &#8216;I told you so&#8217;.  Once again, the appellate tribunal would only send the matter back if it had confidence that, with guidance, the Tribunal, because there were matters which it had not, would not yet consider at a time it apparently reached a conclusion would be prepared to look fully at such further matters and thus be willing or unable to come to a different conclusion if so advised.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with Mr Smith.  The ET, as currently constituted, has been seised of this matter since October 2022 at the latest, when it conducted the liability hearing, and has produced two detailed judgments, the second of which it has reconsidered twice.  It is therefore very familiar with the case.  The ET&#8217;s findings on liability are unchallenged, as are the bulk of its findings on remedy.  The points on which Dr Sharma has succeeded in this appeal are largely points which the ET overlooked in determining remedy rather than points which it specifically and directly addressed and on which it reached conclusions to which it is likely to be wedded.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Even on the ACAS uplift point, it does not appear that the ET considered and rejected a reasoned argument that it could take into account matters which it had not upheld as claims.  Moreover, looking at the tone of the two judgments overall, it is clear that the ET is highly sympathetic to Dr Sharma&#8217;s position.  It made the relevant findings in terms of this particular appeal recognising that there was a significant degree of uncertainty rather than emphatically stating that its conclusions must be the case.  I have every confidence that the ET will conscientiously consider with an open mind the additional points which I propose to remit to it and how they affect the relevant conclusions which led to its overall decision, if at all.  I also take into account that it is generally desirable that the Tribunal which decides liability should decide remedy, and the likely increase in costs if I were to remit the matter to a differently constituted tribunal.</p>
