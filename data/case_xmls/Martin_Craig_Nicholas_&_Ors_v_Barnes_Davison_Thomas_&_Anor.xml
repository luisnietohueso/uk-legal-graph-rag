	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">This is my judgment following a trial which is the result of a bitter dispute between neighbours in Cornwall, all of them living and, so far as the parties to the proceedings are concerned, respectively operating (through a company which is also party to the proceedings) their businesses next to one another.  The location is the hamlet of Bosavern, St Just, in Cornwall, only a few miles short of Land&#8217;s End.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Their company, which carries on the business of breeding falcons, also sues him and his company (the owner and operator of a small farm neighbouring the properties of the claimants and their parents) for the torts of nuisance and negligence and it seeks damages for losses caused to that business.  Those losses are said to be the result of some birds dying and others not breeding as they should (including but not only through smashed and infertile eggs in the relevant year) because of the defendants&#8217; actions. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">There are 8 allegations of nuisance. The damages claim is put at &#163;1,209,000 (to include the loss of chicks over a 10 year period) plus ongoing losses of &#163;344,250 per annum in respect of the loss of 14 breeding pens within the aviary.  The claimants also seek injunctive relief against the defendants, the granting of which they recognise would avoid such ongoing losses to the company. They say the nuisance, which they also frame as negligence, has involved malice on the part of the defendants.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">The defendants deny those claims. The first defendant has his own counterclaim, including a claim for injunctive relief, based upon his own 5 distinct allegations of harassment (pleaded as a non-exhaustive list of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">frequent acts of harassment</span>&#8221; against him by the claimants). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">This is not the only litigation between some of the parties arising out of their adjoining ownership.  In recent proceedings in Truro County Court commenced on 24 November 2022 (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">the Septic Tank Claim</span>&#8221;) the present first defendant sued the two brothers, their parents and another neighbour over what was either a cesspit (per the claimant in those proceedings) or a septic tank (per the defendants).  Those proceedings were compromised before trial by a Tomlin Order dated 10 May 2024.  As I touch on below, by any standards the Septic Tank Claim appears to have been a highly questionable piece of litigation so far as the basis and timing of it (at least in terms of service of the proceedings after the tank in issue had in fact been removed) are concerned.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Factual evidence about forty-eight distinct alleged causes of action (all of which, at least at their high point on the nuisance allegations, involve an allegation of consciously deliberate wrongdoing), some widely diverging submissions about actionability under the law of nuisance (despite further recent Supreme Court clarification of the principles), some sweeping and largely unchallenged submissions from each side about the approach to awards of damages for nuisance and harassment (of the type relevant to this case) including the potential liability of a director for the torts of his company, a relatively rudimentary approach to ROP&#8217;s claim for ongoing losses (including after the claimants&#8217; production of a very detailed and potentially discombobulating document on the eve of trial about breeding numbers) and, finally by way of this summary of the bigger points requiring considerable thought for this judgment, the need to analyse detailed veterinary scientific evidence about the nature and cause of illness and death in gyr falcons, all make for a very long judgment.</p>

ROP focuses upon breeding gyr falcons, peregrine falcons (and gyr/peregrine crosses) though barbary falcons (which are also sometimes used in the cross breeding), Peale&#8217;s falcons and merlins are also raised in its aviaries.  ROP raises chicks both through birds breeding naturally and by &#8220;imprinting&#8221; which is a process of artificial insemination with sperm collected from male falcons which is ejaculated into a hat worn by the breeder.  This is a delicate operation which obviously first requires the breeder to gain some familiarity with the male donor.</p>

While the land was in her ownership it had been farmed by a tenant farmer.  This arrangement probably meant that the Nicholas family was effectively able to use the land between their homes, which provides access to them, as if it was their own.  Indeed, the evidence of Karen Nicholas and Roger Nicholas indicated that they and other members of the public used to walk quite freely over the fields (certainly to the local attraction of Tom Thumb Rock in one of them) and Karen Nicholas said that, before matters turned hostile, Mr Thomas said the Nicholases could walk there.</p>

Martin explained in evidence that the southern section of it was ready for use in 2019 and that all breeding pens in the Aviary save Nos. 34, 35 and 37 were ready for use at the start of the breeding season in 2022.  He said that at that time what remained to be completed was an upper walkway, a tie-down room, and the roof netting of one of the two hack pens.  The hack pens are used for exercising birds.   ROP&#8217;s claim for harm allegedly suffered in 2022 relates to birds in the western side of the Aviary (though not then pens 34, 35 and 37 which were completed later that year) and shaded in pink at Annex 3.  I will refer to these as &#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">the Western Pens</span>&#8221;.  As at 2022, and with the exception of pens i1 and i2 (the &#8220;i&#8221; denotes imprint) the Western Pens had been designed to house naturally breeding pairs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Martin explained in his evidence, which I accept on this point, that the Western Pens were all completed by the end of 2021.  Martin said that, because some of them were newly built and not used to house birds in 2021, they could be used in 2022 to quarantine birds imported early that year from Dubai.  Now that the Aviary has been operating for some years, imported birds are now quarantined in a shipping container to the north of the Aviary before being put into pens.  The Western Pens had been designed for pairs of birds.  On the site visit I could see the modification of the Western Pens that ROP has been undertaking in the light of what it says was the harm caused to birds in 2022 as a result of activity on UCE&#8217;s land.  The modification will see the west-facing windows in the Western Pens being closed off so that falcons in those pens will not be susceptible to visual interferences from UCE&#8217;s land.  ROP proposes to use those pens as breeding pens for imprint birds rather than breeding pairs.</p>

When the court&#8217;s focus should be upon the pleaded events, determining whether or not actionable wrongdoing forms any part them and, if so, what the legal consequences of that should be, any inquiry into its underlying cause(s) might be thought to be of questionable relevance and reliability.  That said, it is alleged that Mr Thomas has acted maliciously in causing harm to ROP&#8217;s business and, with the inevitable caveat that no judicial decision some years later can hope to determine objectively, with complete accuracy, why neighbours who initially got along have since fallen out spectacularly, it is necessary to consider whether the actions of either side were motivated by a sense of grievance and malice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Mr Thomas and his partner Daniel Ambler referred to the difficulty in turning cars at the Pengelly end of the alternative access via the straight driveway off the B3306 which runs past Keigwin.  Mr Charles Neave-Hill, who used that driveway when visiting Mr Thomas&#8217;s grandmother, gave evidence to the same effect and assumed, from his subsequent visits to Mr Thomas, that it was no longer used.  For that reason, very soon after UCE bought the land from Mrs Trembath, in October 2020, Mr Thomas approached Mr Joint with a proposal to buy a small part of his land (next to the land with the septic tank) which would have made turning easier. Nothing came of that proposal.</p>

If planning permission can be obtained for that business then the access to UCE&#8217;s land via the Lane (which is also a public footpath) would be an obvious route for customers of that business to use.  If the Nicholases and Mr Joint had not in November 2022 addressed issues with leakage from the old septic tank, by replacing it with a new waste treatment system now confined to Mr Joint&#8217;s land, then that leakage might have impacted negatively upon such use (and use by Mr Thomas and visitors).  Part of the Nicholases&#8217; harassment claim is based upon Mr Thomas putting up a sign on the public footpath on 22 June 2021 which stated &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Regrettably due to mounting legal costs regarding a neighbour dispute over pollution&#8230;</span>&#8221; there would be no camping (of a less formal kind not requiring planning permission) in the field that year. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Septic Tank Claim was issued on 24 November 2022.   It was a claim based on Mr Thomas&#8217;s contention the sewage system on Mr Joint&#8217;s land was a cesspit (as it was described in a relevant conveyance) rather than a septic tank with soakaways into Field No. 8440; and the particulars of claim put the Nicholases and Mr Joint to strict proof that a soakaway existed and was part of the system in respect of which they enjoyed rights of drainage.  That contention was to some extent pursued by and on behalf of Mr Thomas at the trial before me.  Yet it is at odds with the express recognition by his former solicitors in a letter dated 8 July 2021 (to which those particulars of claim referred) which stated the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">septic tank drains into a soakaway system situated on CL184450</span>&#8221; before noting that the precise location of the soakaway system appeared to be a matter of disagreement between the parties.</p>

The septic tank was emptied regularly by a tanker but the system evidently had soakaways running into the field.  Part of Martin&#8217;s and Scott&#8217;s case in these proceedings is that Mr Thomas caused one of his contractors to damage the soakaway pipes.</p>

At the time of its replacement the Nicholases did not know the claim had been issued and only became aware of it through the not very seasonal act of service by the court on 23 December 2022. Before UCE bought the land in 2020 they had been in discussions with Mrs Trembath about installing a new septic tank and soakaways (drawings had been prepared) and the Environment Agency had been approached for the relevant permit. There had been a leak in the field which the Nicholases had tried to address by depositing rubble and soil while the EA&#8217;s approval to a replacement system was sought. Martin explained in evidence that Mrs Trembath put the plans for a replacement on hold.  It seems to me to be quite likely that this was because of her plans to sell the land.</p>

It is therefore not for me to address the merits of a claim for injunctive relief on a claim which, as I have explained, lost its substratum two days after it was issued and before proceedings were served.  However, I was shown some recent inter-solicitor correspondence (from October 2024) which recorded the Nicholases&#8217; suggestion that a right of way over the Lane to access the new sewage system, for the purposes of future maintenance, needed to be recorded in a deed to reflect two provisions of the Tomlin Order.  In his evidence, Mr Thomas explained why he had not engaged further with that suggestion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Part of the present dispute also concerns a rainwater drain on the Lane (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">the Drain</span>&#8221;) situated just outside the front wall of No. 2 Bosavern Cottage and whether it was being used to receive grey water (i.e. household waste water) from one or both of Bosavern Cottages.  The Drain was constructed some 8 years ago, and therefore some time before UCE purchased its land from Mrs Trembath, when extensions to the front of Nos 1 and 2 Bosavern Cottages were built.  The Drain, and some kerbing stones which had been installed by the Nicholases to divert rainwater into it, were on the Lane.  Following UCE&#8217;s acquisition of the land, the Drain positioned on the Lane became another bone of contention between the parties. The removal of the kerbing stones on Mr Thomas&#8217;s instructions is part of the claimants&#8217; harassment claim.</p>

ROP has relied upon the number on the A10 Certificate in this case, rather than its ring number, out of a concern that the latter can be used to trace a bird&#8217;s breeding lineage.

This extends to any buildings upon it and to rights appurtenant to his ownership interest. The focus is upon the diminution in the utility and amenity value of the land as opposed to harm to the person. Nuisance is therefore a property-based tort. The claimant must have a legal interest in the land in order to have standing to sue. ([9]-[11]).</p>

The cause of the interference may be something physical and/or tangible (such as invasive plants spreading from the defendant&#8217;s property) or intangible (such as noise, fumes, vibration or excessive light emanating from it).  In principle, the sight offered to the claimant by the use to which the defendant&#8217;s property is put may be so offensive as to constitute a nuisance. ([12]-[17]).</p>

The need to balance the (sometimes) conflicting rights of neighbouring landowners, or the principle of reciprocity often described in terms of &#8220;give and take&#8221;, means that the court must have grounds for concluding that the defendant&#8217;s activity is unlawful.  Only if it is unlawful will it then be appropriate to label it, in what otherwise would be question-begging and legally vague terms, as an &#8220;undue&#8221; or &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; interference with the claimant&#8217;s enjoyment.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.65in;text-indent:0.11in">Any decision that the defendant&#8217;s activity is unlawful (and, therefore, constitutes an undue or unreasonable interference with the claimant&#8217;s enjoyment of his land) must at the first stage rest upon the twin-limbed conclusion that there has been a s<span style="font-style:italic">ubstantial </span>interference with the <span style="font-style:italic">ordinary</span> use of the claimant&#8217;s land. The test of whether or not the interference is <span style="font-style:italic">substantial</span> is an objective one and is applied by reference to the standards of an ordinary or average person in the claimant&#8217;s position.  It is aimed at eliminating small or trifling inconveniences to leave those which may sensibly be categorised as actionable interferences.  That the defendant&#8217;s activities must interfere with the ordinary use of the land is aimed at eliminating unjustified claims which are instead founded upon interferences with land use that is out of the ordinary.  Lord Leggatt endorsed the observation in a decision of the Privy Council in 1902: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">A man cannot increase the liabilities of his neighbour by applying his own property to special uses, whether for business or pleasure</span>.&#8221; This limb of the test therefore requires the court to consider the type of property in question within its surrounding neighbourhood: &#8216;the locality principle&#8217;.  It is contrary to the notion of &#8220;give and take&#8221; that a claimant should, by using his land for purposes beyond the ordinary and which carry with them particular sensitivity to neighbouring activity, increase the potential liability of his neighbour under the law of nuisance.

However, if the defendant&#8217;s activities fall outside the common and ordinary use of his land then it is no defence to say that the design of the building occupied by the claimant means the claimant is particularly sensitive to their consequences. Neither is it a defence to say that the claimant&#8217;s building might have been differently constructed or designed so as to avoid the nuisance. It is the utility of the actual land, including the buildings actually constructed on it, for which the law of private nuisance provides protection, not for some hypothetical building of &#8220;average&#8221; or &#8220;ordinary&#8221; construction and design.  ([62]-[75] and [83]).  It is possible that there could be an &#8220;extreme case&#8221; where the design or construction of a building is so unusual and far from anything that could actually be foreseen that its physical attributes might give rise either to a claim or to a defence to a claim in nuisance.

Mr Auld placed particular reliance upon that passage in Lord Leggatt&#8217;s judgment.  In both of those cases the claim in nuisance failed. In <span style="font-style:italic">Robinson v Kilvert</span> the plaintiff&#8217;s brown paper (sold by weight) was affected, through drying out and becoming brittle, by a level of heat from the defendant&#8217;s basement premises which would not have affected paper generally.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Eastern and South African Telegraph Co</span> the plaintiff&#8217;s submarine telegraph cable and receiving instruments were vulnerable to interference to even minute currents of electricity escaping from the conductor used in the defendant&#8217;s operations.  The plaintiff&#8217;s later construction of a twin-core cable to overcome the problem showed that the defendant&#8217;s operations only affected instruments made in a certain way.</p>

Only an assessment of the surrounding locality will determine whether the claimant is impermissibly seeking to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">increase the liabilities of his neighbour</span>&#8221; or, instead, claiming no more than an immunity from interference of a kind that might be reasonably expected in the locality.

It is important to bear in mind that, whereas most of the earlier authorities address this question in the context of a regular or continuing use of the defendant&#8217;s neighbouring land, ROP&#8217;s allegations of nuisance are based upon isolated acts of interference.  They involve claims arising out of &#8220;temporary&#8221; activity on UCE&#8217;s land (in the sense addressed above) rather than its long-term use for growing grass or crops or grazing livestock.  They also concern a particular sensitivity in ROP&#8217;s operations during the breeding season rather than all year round.</p>

In that case the court also clarified that the &#8220;necessity&#8221; of the defendant&#8217;s acts, which provides him with a defence despite the loss of amenity of the claimant&#8217;s land, does not mean that the land would be incapable of occupation without the acts being done at all.  Instead, necessity in this context draws its meaning from the common and ordinary use and occupation of land.  That is why an assessment of the locality is all important.</p>

Whether or not that use is a reasonable one to be protected against such interference should not necessarily depend upon it being an established use before the defendant&#8217;s activities commence, even though that will often if not usually be the case.</p>

The issue was whether or not the defendant had been actuated by express malice, such as deprive him of the qualified privilege attached to the occasion at which the defamatory words were spoken.  ROP&#8217;s claim is not a defamation case (nor, for that matter, a claim founded upon a conspiracy to injure) but a nuisance claim.  Allowing for potential shifts in the evidential burden, a claim in nuisance which is based on otherwise unobjectionable acts being actionable, because they were done maliciously, is one on which the claimant bears the legal burden of proof to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Again, in my judgment, Mr Auld&#8217;s submission does not accurately reflect the law of nuisance.  If it did it would be almost impossible to establish a claim of the kind contemplated by the ninth proposition, to the extent that the courts would have to question whether an exception for cases of malice really exists.  It would almost always be an answer for the defendant to say he did &#8220;have cause&#8221; to do what he did; that his actions did not go beyond the ordinary exercise of landowning interests and claimant cannot prove otherwise.  Yet in the <span style="font-style:italic">Hollywood Silver Fox Farm</span> case Macnaghten J referred to the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Ibbotson v Peat</span> 3 H&amp;C 644 where the court rejected a defence that letting off fireworks, rockets and bombs (for the purposes of frightening away the grouse that had been attracted away from the Duke of Rutland&#8217;s land to Mr Ibbotson&#8217;s land) was justified because they were the Duke&#8217;s birds.

Many of the authorities cited in the judgment of the Board were cases of public nuisance, though some involved a private nuisance and the decision addressed claims of nuisance generally when deciding that, as with negligence, foreseeability of loss is an essential element of liability.

In their Lordships' judgment the similarities between nuisance and other forms of tort to which <span style="font-style:italic">The Wagon Mound (No. 1)</span> applies far outweigh any differences, and they must therefore hold that the judgment appealed from is wrong on this branch of the case.

By comparison with the three cases just discussed above, the closest analogy would appear to be between the dead birds and the polluted water in the borehole which the water company could no longer use to supply its customers.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Cambridge Water</span> the trial judge had dismissed the claim in nuisance (and negligence) on the ground that the defendant could not reasonably have foreseen the damage to the borehole (by the solvents percolating through the ground).  There appears to have been no argument or discussion over any point that, even if that damage should reasonably have been foreseen, the economic loss incurred in creating a replacement borehole was irrecoverable as a matter of principle.</p>

As he pointed out, Lord Westbury LC was not seeking to suggest that there were two torts of nuisance, one relating to material injury to property and the other concerned with causing sensible personal discomfort such as that arising from excessive noise or smells. There is one tort, concerned in both types of case with injury to land. In the latter case, the injury to the land is because its utility has been diminished by the existence of the nuisance. Referring to <span style="font-style:italic">Bone v Seale</span> [1975] 1 WLR 797, which concerned a nuisance arising from smells from a pig farm, Lord Hoffmann observed the value of the right to occupy a house which smells of pigs must be less than the value of the occupation of an equivalent house which does not; in the case of a transitory nuisance, the owner or occupier is entitled to compensation for the diminution in the amenity value of the property during the period for which the nuisance persisted; as he said, the injury to the amenity of the land consists in the fact that the persons upon it are liable to suffer inconvenience, annoyance or illness (p 706).&#8221;</p>

Subject to the need for the claimant to establish that the loss is of a kind that results from the interference (i.e. is connected with the use to which that property is put) I see no reason for drawing a distinction between a property which is put to personal use and one which is put to commercial use.  </p>

At the start of the whelping season the claimant notified officials at the Highway Department that noise from the operations would endanger the lives of female mink and their young. Orders were therefore given by the engineer in charge to leave a 1200 feet gap in the roadworks so as to avoid such disturbance but the defendant nevertheless operated its machinery within the prohibited area.</p>

However, both formulas provide a useful reminder that the aim of the tort of nuisance is that the freedom of neighbouring landowners regarding the use of their property should be maximised in a symmetrical way, so far as possible. An occupier is not confined to using their property in a way which matches the ways in which neighbours use theirs. Rather, as Lord Wright put it, &#8220;A balance has to be maintained between the right of the occupier to do what he likes with his own, and the right of his neighbour not to be interfered with&#8221;.&#8221;</p>

The conduct must cross the boundary between that which is unattractive, even unreasonable, and conduct which is oppressive and unacceptable. To cross the border from the regrettable to the objectionable, the gravity of the misconduct must be of an order which would sustain criminal liability under s.2: <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Majrowski</span> [30] per Lord Nicholls; <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Dowson</span> [142] per Simon J; <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hourani</span> [139]-[140] per Warby J; see also <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Conn -v- Sunderland City Council</span><span> </span><span style="font-weight:bold">[2007] EWCA Civ 1492</span> [12] per Gage LJ.

Cases of alleged harassment may also engage the complainant&#8217;s Article 8 rights. If that is so, the Court will have to assess the interference with those rights and the justification for it and proportionality: <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hourani</span> [142]-[146].

The case concerned claims under the Equality Act 2010 for disability discrimination (including through harassment and victimisation) an award of damages for &#8220;injured feelings&#8221; under section 119(4): see the judgment of Underhill LJ at [13].  <span style="font-style:italic">Vento</span> itself was a decision concerning (amongst other heads of damage under appeal) the appropriate level of compensation for injury to feelings under section 66(4) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975.</p>

There are references in that passages to awards of &#163;7,000 in a case in 2009 about harassment for an unpaid debt and &#163;5,500 (which the author suggests was on the low side) in a 2010 decision concerned with harassment in the form of persistent, offensive, abusive, intimidating, bullying, humiliating and insulting behaviour of a woman soldier by army officers.  Damages at those levels (after the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Vento</span> in 2002) provide no support for applying guidance to Employment Tribunals to this case under the 1997 Act.</p>

In this case there is little contemporaneous documentation of past events.  There are some video recordings of some of those events (or parts of them) which, so far as the film captured them, show what they record.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Instead, this is a case where the parties&#8217; respective accounts (including that given by third party witnesses) of certain key events is in such direct conflict that the court is left to decide whether or not the event happened at all, or happened in the way the alleging party said it did.  On such matters, one witness (possibly more than one) was not telling the truth.  The nature of the event or alleged event, generally, is such that the conflicting testimony cannot be because one witness&#8217;s memory has over time and through the litigation process unwittingly become distorted by <span style="font-style:italic">Gestmin</span> type factors.  The events in question are not that long ago and generally involve some kind of confrontation or personal inter-reaction.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Unsurprisingly, this creates difficulties for reliable decision-making in the way the deliberately untruthful witness must intend.  On my assessment of the testimony, the process of cross-examination <span style="font-style:italic">alone</span> has not given the court sufficient material to conclude, in relation to any particular witness, that his or her testimony can simply be ignored on a key point.  With the possible exception of Adrian Thomas developing his evidence by saying he put draft heads of terms produced by Mr Brady in the Aga, without troubling his son with them, the cross-examination did not elicit from any witness some confession, concession or self-contradiction, or produce evident discomfort for that witness, as a pointer towards the truth. Therefore, any conclusion as to which of two conflicting witnesses was telling the truth about a particular event must rest on wider considerations.  That involves looking at the event in context and, where relevant, assessing the reliability of a witness&#8217;s account of other matters or what others (supportive or not) have said about it.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The clear indications that the evidence of Mr Thomas and Adrian Thomas has sought to downplay their knowledge of the concern expressed by Martin and Scott about the impact of UCE&#8217;s building work on the wellbeing of the falcons.  I refer below to my acceptance of the evidence of Martin, Scott and Mr Brady which bears upon this point. Further, there is a statement made by Mr Thomas in his &#8216;rebuttal response&#8217; to the letter of claim dated 12 December 2022 which he provided to Dr Forbes for the purpose of Dr Forbes providing an initial report.  This document was not put to Mr Thomas in cross-examination because it was only produced at the end of the trial (in the circumstances I explain below when addressing Dr Forbes&#8217;s evidence).  In the rebuttal response Mr Thomas stated: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I have no knowledge that my building works were creating a problem for the claimants breeding season until Mr John Brady (claimants&#8217; representative) spoke to my father on 6 May 2022</span>.&#8221;  However, in his witness statement, confirmed in testimony, Mr Thomas confirmed that an email from Martin dated 24 October 2022, about the building works causing the birds harm, was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the first time any of the Claimants had ever raised direct concerns with me regarding their birds</span>&#8221; and the claimants had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">never voiced that birds had died in 2022 until the letter of claim was issued in December 2022</span>.&#8221;  In testimony, he went on to say that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">they had been through lots of other people, but not to me directly</span>.&#8221;  In cross-examination, he referred to getting &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">snippets</span>&#8221; from Adrian Thomas and his (Mr Thomas&#8217;s) brother-in-law, Tom Patrick, about their communications with Mr Brady and Martin, respectively, in May 2022.  He did accept that he understood through Mr Patrick that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">eggs were dying</span>&#8221;.  Addressing Mr Brady&#8217;s involvement, Mr Thomas said Mr Brady introduced himself as having been sent by Martin&#8217;s &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Arab business partner</span>&#8221; regarding the issue of the septic tank (which Mr Thomas thought was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">weird</span>&#8221;) and that his father had also relayed to him that Mr Brady was working for Mr Lootah.  Archie Pilcher&#8217;s witness statement used almost identical language in describing the encounter. This evidence is at odds with Mr Brady&#8217;s evidence. Mr Thomas said it was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">absolute nonsense</span>&#8221; that he knew he had been causing harm to the birds.  He was also anxious to make clear that Mr Patrick was not acting on his instructions in communicating with Martin.  As for Adrian Thomas, Mr Thomas accepted that his father was acting on his behalf.   Mr Thomas said he did not see the more detailed heads of terms presented by Mr Brady (which addressed the cessation of building works during the breeding season) until disclosure in this claim; and in several of his answers in cross-examination he was reluctant to expand upon what his father had reported back on his meetings with Mr Brady.   Although the two statements in his witness statement quoted above have not been shown to be strictly untrue, I have the clear impression that, now faced with ROP&#8217;s claim, Mr Thomas (and his father) has sought to distance himself from the concerns Martin and Mr Brady were expressing in May 2022 about the harm the building works were having on the falcons.   The statement in his rebuttal response provided to Dr Forbes appears to summarise succinctly the point that Mr Thomas learned from his father in early May 2022 that Mr Brady was acting on behalf of the claimants rather than Mr Lootah and that their concern, expressed through Mr Brady, was about the welfare of the birds rather than focussed upon the septic tank (or, as Adrian Thomas said in his witness statement, the septic tank, silage bales and stone piles in the field).</p>

I refer to the issue of the summary judgment application returnable at the PTR and Mr Auld&#8217;s submission at the start of the trial that the timing of the service of ROP&#8217;s Summary (see below) was such that the nuisance/negligence claim should be deferred.  It is of course open to any litigant to seek to avail himself of any relevant provisions of the CPR to say that the court should not entertain a claim on it is merits; and I recognise that a failure to persuade the court to act accordingly obviously does not mean that there is no defence to it that can be made good at trial.  Nevertheless, the summary judgment application was late and hugely ambitious: Mr Auld&#8217;s analysis of <span style="font-style:italic">Fearn</span> (which was a big part of it) did not match my own above and was certainly not compelling enough to forestall full investigation of the falcon claim at a trial.  It is clear that Mr Thomas has been keen to avoid that investigation, including his own part in the claim, and the court cannot ignore that.</p>

The evidence in this case supports Adrian Thomas&#8217;s remark to Martin (which I accept was made) that Mr Thomas has an angry side if things do not go his way.   This inevitably creates doubt as to whether Mr Thomas really is someone who, as he protested a number of times in the witness box, adopts the position of live and let live with his neighbours.  He has proved to be a controversial neighbour.  His creation of a lake on UCE&#8217;s land and his removal of a stile on the public footpath (later reinstated in the light of complaints) have provoked opposition within the wider neighbourhood, and Land&#8217;s End Airport which is concerned about the increased risk of bird strikes from birds visiting the lake, and the first was the subject matter of an article in the Daily Mail in June 2024.  Yet, in evidence before the court were a number of social media posts and an article in the Daily Express (from November 2021) which show that Mr Thomas appears to be ready to see himself as the victim and to publicise that as widely as he can.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The force of some of the criticisms about the witness statements of the defendants&#8217; witnesses made in the claimants&#8217; closing submissions.  The claimants&#8217; solicitors had pointed out a number of respects in which some of those witness statements did not comply with Practice Direction 57AC following exchange of witness statements in June 2024.  I regard those points as going to credibility (in some cases) rather than admissibility as the claimants suggested. It has been correctly pointed out that 7 of the witnesses (and Mr Thomas&#8217;s expert, Dr Forbes) mentioned the noise from aeroplanes and helicopters in the vicinity of the Aviary in what became a rather formulaic approach and one which, alongside the reference by some witnesses to noises caused by the Nicholases themselves, smacked of an attempt to argue a case on causation (going beyond a description of the area for the purposes of the locality principle).  For example, the evidence of Mrs Caroline Gill , who lives with her husband in Keigwin and who was open in her support for Mr Thomas, was largely devoted to such matters about other disturbances. The witness statements of Mr Thomas and Mr Pilcher also used materially identical language in describing their first encounter with Mr Brady.  This included each of them saying that Mr Brady introduced himself as having been sent by Martin&#8217;s business partner in relation to the septic tank.  Given what I have said in point (i) above and my acceptance of Mr Brady&#8217;s evidence that he had come down on behalf of Martin to discuss the issues relating to the falcons (Mr Lootah appearing to have no interest at all in the septic tank) the similarity in those two statements is troubling.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Martin explained that the Aviary had been built closer to public footpath running between his and Scott&#8217;s land and the land then owned by Deborah Trembath (than as had been indicated by design drawings prepared for planning permission purposes) because that was necessitated by the discovery that a South-West Water mains pipe was not positioned where drawings indicated it to be.  The soil bunds to the west and north of the Aviary &#8211; using the soil excavated to create a flat area for the Aviary within a sloping field -  were part of the planning requirement that the Aviary should be partially screened from sight rather than motivated by protection of the birds.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">He also explained that he had put birds he had imported from Canada in 2019 into some of the Western Pens (those then built) before UCE bought the neighbouring land.  He said that the imported birds put into some of those pens in 2022, including Gyr 03, Gyr 05 and Gyr 06, were all of breeding age and, not having previously been in a breeding pen, were capable of breeding straight away.  Agreeing with a statement by Mr Garland, the claimants&#8217; expert, he said that moving a female falcon from one breeding pen to another may mean she will not lay eggs for one or two years before she settles into the new pen.  This, he said, did not apply to the birds put into the Western Pens in 2022. Martin also said that there was no room in the Aviary in 2022 to move birds out of the Western Pens and that moving emotional birds that are paired together would result in them trying to kill one another.  They could not go into the hack pens, where the chicks were reared, as they would claim it as their territory and kill every other bird in there.  I accept this evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Martin&#8217;s evidence, corroborated by Scott&#8217;s evidence, is that the brothers had a conversation with Mr Thomas in December 2020, when relations between them were good, about the building of a barn on UCE&#8217;s land and that there was a discussion that the works should not proceed during the falcons&#8217; breeding season due to the sensitivity of the birds.  He says that he told him that the birds would treat excessive noise or visual disturbances as a threat and would try to fly away if scared; and a lack of escape could result in them panicking and smashing or abandoning their eggs or abandoning their young. Martin says he showed Mr Thomas an article on his phone about a breeder of falcons in Germany who had lost birds to aspergillosis caused by a nearby mushroom farm. I accept this conversation took place. However, I have not been persuaded that the breeding season was identified in this conversation as being from March to August.  Martin&#8217;s own evidence is that February to May was identified as the most sensitive time.</p>

Martin said it was not related to any such incident, which he did not know about, and that he visited because he had seen Ed McFadden removing the cover to the Drain early one morning (it having been removed for the first time a few days earlier).  Martin said that, on his visit to Nanquidno Farm, Adrian Thomas (who he has known for about 30 years) admitted that Mr Thomas has a nasty side if he does not get his own way, that he would speak to him about the Drain but said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I wouldn&#8217;t hold your breath</span>&#8221;.

ROP&#8217;s Summary was produced on the eve of trial and it will be apparent from what I say about it below that it is unfortunate that the timing of it has raised some further significant questions which I have been left to ponder for the purposes of this judgment. Martin said he had prepared it in response to the defendants&#8217; application for reverse summary judgment on the falcons claim (listed at the PTR on 29 November 2024 but which I declined to entertain given the imminent trial and a completely unrealistic time estimate of 1 hour) as his third witness statement made in response to that application said he would.  Martin also said, and this was borne out by Dr Forbes&#8217;s evidence, that ROP&#8217;s Summary reflected what Dr Forbes had said during an August 2024 site visit about the need for evidence about the identification of birds and breeding records. </p>

The experts agree it died of amyloidosis.  Martin carried out a post-mortem on Gyr 05.  The claimants&#8217; Part 18 response dated 26 January 2024 referred to a mortality report prepared by Martin which said Gyr 05 died on 14 April 2022 from amyloidosis, pneumonia and enteritis.  In his evidence he said that the bird died of an infection in its respiratory system.  Martin explained that Gyr 06 died and fell off the perch late one evening on 10 May 2022.  He said he did open up the bird to see if there was anything obvious and then put her in the freezer to await further examination.  However, one of ROP&#8217;s workers inadvertently disposed of the carcass so it was not available for further examination.  Therefore, no post-mortem was carried out on Gyr 06.</p>

He exchanged WhatsApp messages with him about the wildlife visiting Mr Thomas&#8217;s newly created lake on UCE&#8217;s land.  He sent a message to Mr Thomas on 14 July 2021 telling him that some of his silage bales had been slashed and saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">this had nothing to do with us before you start pointing fingers</span>.&#8221;  It was Mr Thomas&#8217;s reaction to say that he would be phoning the police about that and Scott pulling down the sign about camping that led to Scott ending their exchanges using expletives (see paragraph 532 below).  Scott accepted that he had previously pulled down the sign which Mr Thomas had put up on a gate next to the public footpath saying there would be no camping that year because of a dispute with his neighbours over pollution.  He said that the sign gave a false impression: see harassment allegation (13).</p>

Scott said the stopping off of the relevant water supply had been done many years ago after Roger Nicholas had agreed with the former owner that he could make use of the supply while he undertook building works about 20 years ago.

Scott&#8217;s question &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">are you a pervert too?</span>&#8221;, recorded in a video of 3 January 2025 and directed at Mr Thomas when Scott took exception to what he says was Mr Ambler filming his family while they were on electric bikes, related to his concern that Mr Ambler had been taking pictures of Scott&#8217;s two children aged 4 and 8 (rather than recent works to the Western Pens, with no children in sight, as Mr Ambler testified) and it was this that would risk Mr Ambler getting &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">30 years in jail</span>&#8221;.</p>

She rejected in forthright terms the suggestion that she had blocked Adrian Thomas&#8217;s exit to the road on one occasion and tried to ram his Land Rover.  Her clear account of the incident (which she said was a Tuesday because she was taking her daughter and niece to their musical theatre class and not Sunday 20 November 2022 as stated by Adrian Thomas) struck me as completely reliable and indicative of the temper of Adrian Thomas.  Likewise, she said that the statements by Mr Thomas and Mr Ambler that she had been in her car late one evening, acting as a lookout and temporarily blocking their access, while Martin cut electric fences on UCE&#8217;s land, was completely false.</p>

This includes her evidence that in March 2022 she telephoned both the RSPB and the RSPCA to express concern about the welfare of the birds in the light of the activity on UCE&#8217;s land.  This is significant when assessing the conflict between her and Ed McFadden as to whether she expressed concern about the noise he was making with his digger on 2 May 2022 by reference to her own welfare or the welfare of the birds.  Her evidence did not, however, address harassment allegation (8) even though Martin identified her as directly witnessing the event complained about.</p>

However, in his testimony he accepted he was not best pleased (as he was replacing the cover for the storm drain which had already been removed once and shortly before) and that, as Mr Ambler came by on a Gator farm vehicle, he did approach him carrying the crowbar which he had been using to lever a replacement cover into place.  He was mouthing things to Mr Ambler over the noise of the vehicle, and accepted he came right up to Mr Ambler&#8217;s face, though he denied threatening him with the crowbar or calling him &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a fucking faggot</span>&#8221;.

Mr Brady then asked a friend, with some legal knowledge, to prepare the heads of agreement and Adrian Thomas collected them a couple of days later to discuss with Mr Thomas.  Mr Brady said a few days after that Adrian Thomas returned to say that Mr Thomas would not sign the document and that Mr Brady should send it to Mr Thomas&#8217;s solicitors whose details were given.

The implied suggestion was, therefore, that one or more members of the adults in the Nicholas family would risk engaging in a criminal assault and a resulting prosecution if it was not supported by video evidence.  Having heard all the evidence and formed by my own (necessarily limited and imperfect) assessment of the Nicholas family, this was an irrational fear on his part.  None of Martin, Scott, Karen or Roger Nicholas came across as a person who would assault their neighbour if only they could be sure it was not captured on film.

Her account of that first part of Martin&#8217;s visit accords with Martin being indignant about Mr Thomas&#8217;s actions. She had to remind Martin that it was her son she was talking about.  So far as the second part of that visit was concerned, her witness statement made it clear that she relied upon what her husband said (after Martin had left) about Martin expressing concern that his father, Roger Nicholas, had done something stupid and was going to get into trouble for it.</p>

It is understandable that a mother, being told by her son that he is fleeing from a stranger for fear of his own safety, will probably side against that stranger (in this case Mr Brady).  She said that Mr Thomas and Archie Pilcher were sitting in her kitchen for hours afterwards in a distressed state.  I do not doubt that evidence but my conclusions about what happened that day mean that her own perception of matters (and in particular the degree of menace presented by Mr Brady whose identity she did not then know) have become distorted as a consequence.  I accept her account of the event (videoed by her) of the brief meeting with Mr Brady on 27 July 2022.</p>

He explained that his own business was near a road, a clay pigeon shooting ground and an industrial site.  The shooting ground is accessed via a bridlepath next to his aviary and that if a big shoot is scheduled then over 500 vehicles may use it. He said the shooting took place 6&#189; days a week and his birds become acclimatised to it.  A younger bird moved into a new aviary will acclimatise more quickly than an older bird.  The two young birds from the Yukon, mentioned above, were moved from quarantine into a big pen and eggs were laid 14 days later.</p>

He said it is important to avoid such noises, to which the birds have not become accustomed, in the months of March, April and May.

He said that in his experience the success rate for a hen of breeding age to lay eggs was around 80%.  He did not include recently introduced birds, who have yet to acclimatise, in that figure.  However, he would not exclude from that calculation birds who were only in their first year in the pens, though his answer did suggest that it would only be if birds put together the previous autumn &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">and we see good courtship, food passing, things like that, the male has to feed the female, and then you see a copulation, you&#8217;d be expecting eggs</span>&#8221;.

Mr Garland and Dr Forbes agreed that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">not all female falcons of breeding age necessarily lay eggs in the first year</span>.&#8221; He disagreed that Gyr 03, Gyr 05 and Gyr 06 had been in their pens for too short a time to acclimatise to their surroundings for the purposes of successfully breeding in 2022. </p>

If, however, the bird has had only a few eggs then they may lay eggs more regularly and for longer.  Mr Garland also said that a breeder would hope to get 80% saleable chicks from the eggs laid but agreed with Dr Forbes that the percentage of fertile eggs that are reared to sale age will vary between different breeders but is not expected to exceed 70% to 80%.  He said if an egg is totally clear than that is almost always a male bird fertility problem.  When asked about ROP&#8217;s claim for non-breeding falcons, and 3 pairs of gyr falcons being expected to 15 chicks, Mr Garland was clear that he would expect to breed 15 chicks &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">if they were good birds in their prime</span>&#8221;.</p>

As explained further below, that report engaged with ROP&#8217;s Summary served the day before the start of the trial.  It is therefore unsurprising that the court had not by pre-trial directions given permission for the service of a further report from Dr Forbes.  The untidy way in which this element of expert evidence came to be introduced into the case is of the claimants&#8217; own making.  Dr Forbes said he had asked Martin for clarification of the bases of ROP&#8217;s claimed losses at a site meeting on 23 August 2024.  It seems likely that ROP&#8217;s Summary would not have been produced at all had the defendants not issued their summary judgment application on 12 November 2024.  I accept that there was evidence that Martin had suffered an injury as a result of an accident in the Middle East, which meant it could not be produced by the time of that application, but the short point is that it should not have required that application for it to be produced in accordance with the pre-trial directions made at the CCMC in December 2023.</p>

This is illustrated by the fact that the claimants&#8217; written closing submissions invited me to take note of suggested errors within the Dr Forbes&#8217;s Supplemental Report which were said to have been identified only following a review of his oral evidence at trial.  The making of such post-trial points is not something envisaged by orderly observance of pre-trial directions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Nevertheless, some of the criticisms of Dr Forbes&#8217;s evidence had more force.  There are passages in his expert evidence where he can be said to have perhaps lost sight of the need to remain objective in assisting the court on matters within his expertise.  For example, his Report went into some detail about the flying activity from RNAS Culdrose (including the types and specification of aircraft flying from the base) and the suggested resulting impact of noise and vibration within the Aviary. His Report expressed the opinion that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Bosavern is the wrong location for a falcon breeding farm</span>&#8221; (his language in the joint statement, with which Mr Garland did not agree, was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">not ideal</span>&#8221;). He relied upon photographs of bonfire smoke near the Aviary, said to be from fires on ROP&#8217;s land, and said this was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">an incredibly dangerous and risky thing to do in the vicinity of birds</span>&#8221;.  The photos were taken in December 2023, so significantly after the dates of the alleged acts of nuisance.  He made a comment about further evidence being required of ROP to establish the quantum of its losses and about ROP&#8217;s unrealistic expectation that no rotting or degrading or fermenting material should be within 400m of the Aviary &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">when the breeder only owns 10% of the land that is within 400m of his Aviary</span>.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Dr Forbes also expressed his understanding that Martin was in breach of the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 in carrying out a post-mortem on Gyr 05 and giving evidence of his conclusions.  As I understand the point, it is Martin&#8217;s making a diagnosis of disease, rather than undertaking the post-mortem, which Dr Forbes considers may contravene the provision in section 19 which restricts the practice of &#8220;veterinary surgery&#8221; (as defined in section 27) to those registered as veterinary surgeons. In testimony he said he had discussed the matter with the legal department of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons who has invited him to submit material to them following this case.  That this is a point to be raised and pursued (if pursued at all) by the lawyers acting in the case, rather than by an expert in his evidence while the case continues, is illustrated by the fact that Mr Auld&#8217;s skeleton argument made reference to the point with a view to discouraging Martin from confirming his diagnosis in testimony on the ground he might incriminate himself.  It is an adversarial point aimed, indirectly, at excluding evidence.</p>

The purpose was to establish whether or not it revealed material instructions of Dr Forbes prior to those given by Nalders.  I made it clear that, if it was claimed that, in addition to any summary of Mr Thomas&#8217;s instructions, the document contained legally privileged material (CPR 35.10 confirms the expert&#8217;s instructions are not privileged but are generally beyond the scope of disclosure or interrogation on the basis that the expert has set out the substance of them) then the relevant material should be redacted pending my further decision on any challenge to that claim.</p>

However, as one of a number of points highlighting allegedly flawed data (or use of it) in ROP&#8217;s summary, Dr Forbes did question (his query no. 5) whether 3 eggs had been smashed in pen 5 in 2022 and made another point (his query no. 6) about the reliability of the comparison with 2021.

The parties had agreed upon a 9 day trial (an extension from the 5 days originally directed because of the number of witnesses to be called by the defendants) and the last day, for closing submissions supported by whatever written summary each side chose to prepare beforehand.

I did not accept that submission, given the trial timetable outlined above and that equal opportunity.  However, in my judgment it would be unfair for me to make findings, as urged by the claimants&#8217; written submissions, that Dr Forbes (whose Supplemental Report relied heavily upon alleged flaws in ROP&#8217;s Summary) was himself acting on flawed data.  None of the detailed points in the three pages of submission (containing 2 tables covering pen production over 11 pens in 2021, 2023 and 2024) were put to him in cross-examination.  Nor were they addressed in Mr Mitchell&#8217;s oral submissions in circumstances when the written ones were provided to the court and to the defendants just before the start of hearing on the ninth day.

The first is that, as I have said, this situation has come about as a result of the very late service of ROP&#8217;s Summary.

This point in fact has underpinned Mr Mitchell&#8217;s own submissions when resisting the adjournment of the falcons claim on day one of the trial and then resisting Mr Auld&#8217;s suggestion that there should have been an opportunity for filing more general written submissions after the end of it.  It is clear to me (and may be obvious to the reader from the length of this judgment and certain observations within it) that writing this judgment, even without this further fact-finding and analysis urged by the claimants, has taken a significantly disproportionate amount of time compared with the 9 days of trial. That is the consequence of counsel having to address some very significant issues in the case (most obviously, I think, those relating to quantum) at such a pace that even a 9 day trial time estimate was hugely ambitious; and the court being left in the position of deciding matters without the benefit of their more considered reflection upon them.  However, the parties have held themselves to 9 days of fact-finding and submission (plus a site visit) and neither of them can expect the court to proceed otherwise.  Other court listings in the weeks and months following that ninth day mean that the luxury of inviting the parties back to provide me with more assistance, and the prospect of streamlining the judgment-writing, was not an option.</p>

One bird was examined by Martin Nicholas (who is not a vet), who believed that the bird had died of amyloidosis (whilst Madeiros and Forbes agreed that they could not comment as no veterinary post mortem, or histology had been undertaken).  In the latter case, the experts (for both sides) had been informed that the carcass remained available for inspection, but was then discarded by MN prior to the experts site visit.  The third carcass (subject to this hearing), no post mortem has been conducted and the cause of death remains conjecture, although this report states that it has also been PM by MN.  As an expert well versed in the importance of &#8216;evidential material&#8217;, it surprises me greatly that evidential material (carcasses) have been disposed of.

The point being that if an additional cause of illness and death was on going in the collection during 2022, affecting birds in the &#8216;unaffected group&#8217;, then any such disease might have also been causing some or all of the  claimed reduction in breeding success. </span></p>

Allowing for the fact that this was an old paper, as Dr Forbes commented, and was not concerned with amyloidosis in raptors, the conclusion reached by the paper (analysing birds both with coincident tuberculosis and those without) was that, unlike aspergillosis, classifications such as primary and secondary amyloidosis do not apply to avian amyloidosis. However, noting Dr Forbes&#8217;s point that about long-term overstimulation, it is clear that the study was based upon birds that had been in the zoo for many years. The paper noted that the only bird dying without amyloidosis had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">been in the zoo only 24 months</span>&#8221;.</p>

Dr Forbes also recognised that a chronic infection might be the cause of excessive stimulation of the bird&#8217;s immune system.  His report referred to bumblefoot and visceral gout but in evidence he said the two infections to which amyloidosis has been statistically proven to be linked are tuberculosis and bumblefoot.

Therefore, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the infection or vaccination, which has triggered the excessive stimulation of the immune systems and thereby amyloidosis, is only caused at a time when the bird is in the Middle East, even if clinical disease goes undetected until a later time</span>.&#8221;  It is clear that Dr Forbes&#8217;s expert opinion rested largely upon the fact that across his long career &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he has only treated four gyr falcons in the UK with amyloidosis and each one has been an imported gyr falcon from the Middle East</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he has never diagnosed amyloidosis in any other species of raptor in the UK</span>.&#8221;</p>

If it did then it would be seen in gyr falcons living in the UK because they are &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">stress monsters</span>&#8221;.

He  rejected the suggestion that Gyr 03, Gyr 06 and Gyr 05 had not been in their respective Western Pens long enough to acclimatise to their surroundings before they died. He said there was a difference between introducing a bird into a pen in a neighbourhood with its existing noise and visual instructions and it being in the pen before new disturbances started up.  So far as the pairing of Gyr 03 and Gyr 05 was concerned, Mr Garland said putting a bird in a pen with a new mate would not normally cause stress.</p>

He said amyloidosis in gyr falcons imported from the Middle East longer ago (he referred to 10 years ago) used to be quite common because a lot of them would come from the local market, rather than being birds from specific blood lines, and they were imported without proper health checks and being subject to modern regulation.  His general experience is that amyloidosis in birds from the Middle East is now less common.  This evidence was consistent with Dr Forbes&#8217;s statements (in his report) that he advises his clients to have birds tested for amyloidosis before shipment and that the central veterinary laboratory in Dubai undertakes SAA blood tests.  However, in testimony Dr Forbes said that the current situation in the Middle East is that 60% of gyr falcons dying there do so as a result of amyloidosis (he said he had been told that was the current figure).</p>

However, this point falls to be qualified Dr Forbes&#8217;s observation that amyloidosis may go undetected until a later time.  The article by Murakami <span style="font-style:italic">et al</span>, put to Dr Forbes in cross-examination and referred to below, states &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Typically, avian AA amyloidosis rarely exhibits clinical symptoms and its diagnosis is often determined on postmortem examination.&#8221;</span>   That said, however, Dr Forbes accepted in cross-examination &#8211; by reference to an article he wrote  &#8211; &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Raptor Medicine</span>&#8217; (Seminars in Avian and Exotic Pet Medicine, Vol 9, No. 4 (October 2000), pp. 197-203) &#8211; that the owner of the bird will often have an instinctive feeling as to when a bird is not quite right, even in the absence of overt clinical signs.

So too, Dr Forbes&#8217;s reference to other potential causes of stress within the Aviary, albeit with the emphasis upon the likely success in birds breeding chicks, such as further construction work on the Aviary at the time or regular light aircraft and night-time helicopter flights in the vicinity of the Aviary, which might even cause birds to damage themselves, further illustrates the point.

It is not clear when (presumably before Dr Forbes&#8217;s retirement in 2017) those cases occurred, having regard to Mr Garland&#8217;s point about amyloidosis in Middle Eastern birds not being as prevalent as it used to be, nor how long each of the birds had been in the UK following importation (compared with the 11 to 12 week period Gyr 03 spent in the UK before it died) or whether (compared with the apparent healthiness of Gyr 03 prior to death) the birds in question appeared to be fit and healthy during the relevant period.  Further, both in his report and in testimony, Dr Forbes referenced a study by Hampel <span style="font-style:italic">et al</span>: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Increasing fatal AA amyloidosis in hunting falcons and how to identify the risk: a report from the United Arab Emirates&#8217; </span>(Amyloid, September 2009, 16(3) pp. 122-132).  That study did highlight the prevalence of AA amyloidosis in pure gyr falcons and reported that 30.3% of the falcons examined were susceptible to amyloidosis compared with 12.7% of the peregrine falcons examined.  Dr Forbes said that the gyr falcon is the only species of raptor likely to be imported to the UK from the Middle East.  Although the Hampel study was based upon an examination of birds within the UAE, and amyloidosis within peregrine falcons is not an issue in the present case, it does raise a question as to whether there is any good veterinary scientific reason why a non-imported peregrine falcon living in the UK should not (despite the greater resistance of that species to the disease) die of amyloidosis.  Although Dr Forbes&#8217;s evidence indicates he has not diagnosed such a case, and noting that peregrines may not quite be the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">stress monsters</span>&#8221; that gyrs are, I think the assumption behind his position must be that no peregrine falcon which has spent its entire life in the UK will ever have died from amyloidosis (whether or not a post-mortem was carried out to establish that as the cause of death).  That is a possibility but the boldness of the proposition, if my assumption is correct, inevitably prompts a question about its soundness.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">When I asked Dr Forbes why a gyr falcon at all times resident in the UK could not develop amyloidosis as a result of stress, just as one in the Middle East might, he recognised that is a key point.  He repeated his position that it is only a bird coming from the Middle East (with an immune system already compromised before shipment either by vaccination or infection or possibly a prion) that can die of stress-induced amyloidosis.  In his report Dr Forbes had mentioned but not attached a paper by Murakami <span style="font-style:italic">et al</span> &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Systemic AA amyloidosis as a prion-like disorder</span>&#8217; (Virus Research 207 (2015) pp. 76-81).  This contained the statement: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Birds that are bred under stressful conditions are known to frequently develop AA amyloidosis</span>&#8221;.  Dr Forbes had referred to the paper in the context of his mention of a prion infection being a potential underlying cause and he accepted that there was potential for the court to have been misled through not being aware of the statement; though he maintained the key point that amyloidosis is not seen in the UK unless it is in gyr falcons imported from the Middle East. However, it is what Dr Forbes said in his own March 2020 report for Mr Close which causes me to doubt that matters are as simple as saying that any gyr falcon dying of amyloidosis in the UK must be one that came to the country from the Middle East with its immune system already compromised.  Although the passage quoted in paragraph 306 above did specifically refer to aspergillosis, Dr Forbes referred to his own writing in emphasising the importance of avoiding stress to captive falcons (especially gyr falcons) &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">as stress causes a suppression of the immune system</span>&#8221;.  I have already referred above to section 3 of Dr Forbes&#8217;s report about noise potentially contributing to the suppression of a bird&#8217;s immune system and also his inclusion of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">trauma</span>&#8221; within the causes of the liver synthesizing SAA.  In my judgment, in his expert evidence in this case Dr Forbes has rather downplayed the impact that stress (without more) might have in compromising a falcon&#8217;s immune system as a precursor to amyloidosis.</p>

In any event, the birds in question were not identified by number nor, so far as I can recall, addressed further in written or oral evidence; and Mr Mitchell accepted he had not cross-examined Dr Forbes about a bird imported from Canada dying of amyloidosis.

This is especially so when I infer that the way ROP pleaded its case, both with reference to aspergillosis and the impact of noise of 70dB, may have been heavily influenced by the content of Dr Forbes&#8217;s March 2020 report for Mr Close.  The pleading pre-dated the post-mortem of Gyr 03, which confirmed aspergillosis was a red-herring, and it is that post-mortem which has generated the detailed technical evidence about amyloidosis: what it is, what triggers it and (less clearly) how quickly it develops before death.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Martin&#8217;s evidence is that Gyr 03 died on 3 April 2022 following a period in which the scaffolding business had been operating on UCE&#8217;s land near the Western Pens and dumper trucks and diggers had been in operation.  He says the use of dumper trucks to drop large stones and build up a soil bank began in early January 2022.  Simon James, the owner of the scaffolding business, said his scaffolding materials arrived on UCE&#8217;s land, with the poles being offloaded from the delivery lorry using a HIAB crane, at the end of January 2022. Martin referred specifically to scaffolding poles being dropped from a truck on 25 March 2022 and watching on CCTV some of the birds in those pens flying into the walls (showing Scott the footage of a bird in pen 7 doing this).  He said a bird in pen 11 flew into the walls on 27 March 2022, a day the scaffolders had been working on UCE&#8217;s land, bruising a foot and damaging a back talon (so that the toe had to be amputated).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">I accept Martin&#8217;s evidence about the stress in the birds caused by such activity and it supports more generally a conclusion that Gyr 03 died as a result of the stress suffered within pen 1 caused by those external disturbances.  Although Martin produced some published figures about noise levels created by certain types of commercial or industrial activity, there is no evidence about the noise levels within the Western Pens and whether or not they reached or exceeded 70db.  ROP cannot be expected to have had recording equipment in place in anticipation of such disturbances. However, that the noise levels were sufficient to cause distress among the falcons is clear from his and Scott&#8217;s factual evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">It is one thing to draw an inference that the two birds also died as a result of stress-induced amyloidosis.  There are grounds for doing so in relation to Gyr 05 where Martin&#8217;s post-mortem and photographs appear to show a correlation with the symptoms described in the post-mortem and histology report for Gyr 03.  So far as Gyr 06 is concerned (the mate of Gyr 03 which occupied the same pen) it might be said the bird&#8217;s death about a month later than her mate (on 10 May 2022) is wholly consistent with the development of stress-induced amyloidosis during the period commencing with the disturbances described by Martin.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, mere inference does not find an easy resting place, alongside court directions which provided for a veterinary examination of all three birds, for the purpose of sustaining a conclusion that the proven pathological cause of one death holds good for two others when they have not been subject to veterinary scientific diagnosis.  In my judgment, a judicial decision about a pathological cause of death would be highly questionable, even as the product of weighing the balance of probabilities, when there is no expert evidence about it.  That is obvious enough from the fact that the directions at the CMC provided for expert evidence upon the veterinary science concerning the cause of all three deaths and the reference in the Particulars of Claim to aspergillosis (not amyloidosis) as the likely fatal disease. The fact that ROP&#8217;s Summary contains a mortality report which shows 8 other birds died in the Aviary in 2022 (5 of them gyr falcons and some owned by Mr Lootah not ROP) is a further reason for not proceeding on this technical, scientific point simply on the basis of an inference.</p>

However, as I explain below, that conclusion does not in my judgment mean that, as a matter of factual causation on the nuisance/negligence claim, ROP&#8217;s claim in respect of Gyr 05 and Gyr 06 is thereby stopped in its tracks.</p>

Nevertheless, the bunds (created using soil from the levelling of the site for the Aviary) do shield them to some extent.   The Aviary (which is closer to UCE&#8217;s land than the road partly for the reason explained by Martin) is shielded from the road by a roadside hedge.</p>

During the site visit several small and quite noisy propeller-driven passenger planes were also coming in to land at Land&#8217;s End Airport a short distance away; and conversation had to pause briefly to await their passing overhead. These would be heard and seen overhead by the falcons through the netting of the hack pens and other openings in breeding pens giving a view above. However, the factual and expert evidence in this case demonstrates that regular noises and sights, to which the birds become accustomed, do not present a threat to their welfare.  </p>

At the time relations between them and Mr McFadden were good. He had previously done work for them, including some work on the Aviary and the installation in February 2021 of a septic tank connected to ROP&#8217;s offices, and they had put Mr Thomas in touch with him.  Mr McFadden had been shown around the Aviary and been shown falcons flying in the hack pen. Although Mr McFadden said the claimants&#8217; evidence about his light-hearted remark was fabricated, I am persuaded that their evidence on this point is true.  It would be a strange thing for them to make up such evidence about a teasing remark.  Martin said he visited Mr Thomas as a result of it, and Mr Thomas confirmed that, in the light of their earlier discussion, works would not commence during the breeding season.  I refer below to what Mr McFadden said about building work not taking place in the &#8220;breeding season&#8221; of 2022.</p>

Had he done so then I would have expected Mr Thomas to have questioned that further when the barn was to be finished by the winter of 2022 (as Mr McFadden explained, though he was unclear about timing in terms of when another builder would take over the build after his preparatory groundworks).</p>

In the cross-examination of Mr Semmens it was initially suggested, before the pleaded allegation was put to him, that he was moving the stones from November 2021 through to January 2022.  Likewise, it was put to Mr Thomas that stones and soil were placed there from the start of the year (the transcript of evidence refers to 2021 but it is clear from the context that Mr Mitchell and Mr Thomas understood this to mean 2022).  Mr Semmens, whose evidence I accept, was that it may have been later than November 2021 that he delivered the stones, over two or three visits, but he was clear that it was winter when he delivered them.</p>

Scott said the soil arrived soon after the stones. As the site visit revealed the soil to be between the stones and the public footpath, I would have expected Mr McFadden to have noticed them.  Although there is uncertainty as to which was deposited first, there is no clear evidence to support the conclusion that the soil was deposited (or levelled off by Mr McFadden as he explained in his evidence) after the beginning of March 2022.

Their evidence might raise a nice question among Cornish hedge purists as to whether or not what Mr Thomas had in mind, in terms of creating a boundary to his field qualifies as such a hedge.  They both referred to it as being similar to such &#8216;Cornish hedges&#8217; both on and in the vicinity of Mr Semmens&#8217; own farm, which Mr Thomas wanted to match. However, my understanding of a proposed boundary created by embedded, closely abutting monoliths (the stones that are presently lying horizontally but the idea is that they would be placed vertically) supports the conclusion that the creation of such a boundary would be in accordance with the ordinary and common use of UCE&#8217;s land. As for the soil accumulated near the aviary, Mr Thomas explained that this would be used both in connection with the hedge and for infilling at a new boundary between UCE&#8217;s barn and the adjacent field.</p>

The evidence of Mr Geoffrey Hoad, who had been operating the digger to clear out ditches on &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the far side of the farm land</span>&#8221;, is that it stayed there, with the bucket raised, until the digger was taken away on a low loader trailer (the bucket lowered after loading) because it could not be repaired on site.  For the purpose of on-site inspection by an engineer the bucket was raised.  With the bucket raised next to the Aviary for those 3 days the machine broke the line of sight of at least some birds in the Western Pens.

The uncertainty, which has emerged from the evidence, as to whether Mr Thomas (or Mr Brady for that matter) understood the breeding season to extend into June or beyond June, or was as long as the 6 month period suggested by Martin, would raise obvious questions about the foreseeability of harm and the fairness, justice and reasonableness of holding the defendants to a more enduring duty of care.

The judge will have been persuaded that such evidence was reasonably required to resolve the proceedings for the purposes of CPR 35.1.  If, by that date, it had been clear that none of the three carcasses remained for post-mortem examination then the question would have arisen as to whether or not a direction in those terms would still have been made.

Although Dr Forbes&#8217;s evidence, relying upon the recent importation of the birds from the Middle East, points against that conclusion, his evidence (on this hypothesis perhaps <span style="font-style:italic">assuming</span> that all three birds arrived in the UK with amyloidosis) would also inform the court&#8217;s decision.</p>

However, for the purpose of deciding whether or not ROP succeeds on its pleaded case, it can in my judgment be said that they died as a result of stress created by the acts of nuisance. For the purpose of reaching that conclusion on the balance of probabilities, the evidence of Martin and Scott about the effect those acts had on the birds in the Western Pens is persuasive.  The conclusion is reinforced by the fact that all deaths occurred within a relatively short period of time and that two of the birds were in the same pen.</p>

As I indicated during counsel&#8217;s submissions about whether ROP&#8217;s Summary should be admitted in evidence, and if so with what effect, a quick glance at the wider mortality figures for the Aviary (as a whole and over 4 years) raises a question as to whether these deaths in 2022 should be attributed to the tortious acts.  However, as I have noted and as Dr Forbes recognised, a mortality rate of 7.96% (if not 9.73%) for 2022 is still higher than the rate in the other years and the mortality report therefore does not undermine and perhaps reinforces the factual evidence about the cause of death of these three falcons.</p>

This requires an assessment of the prospect that, but for the acts of nuisance, the breeding pairs in each of those pens would otherwise have laid eggs which would have successfully hatched (as ROP&#8217;s Summary shows the bird in pen 6 later did by producing an apparently successful clutch of 3 later in the season).

Then, in relation to the pair of birds that were in pen 3 in 2022 (and 2021) it appears to give contradictory information about their respective sex and age when recording their details for 2023 (and it seems most likely to me that they have become mistaken with the pair of gyrs that was in pen 19 in 2022, not pen 3).

Allowing for a likely clerical error (the number given for Mr Hussain&#8217;s imprint female ends &#8220;02&#8221; and not &#8220;01&#8221; as for 2022), in 2023, the imprint female that had been in pen i1 produced 5 chicks from 6 eggs and the imprint female that had been in pen i2 produced 4 infertile eggs.

Neither of them indicated it would be anything like 10 years, or to put it another way, that birds of say 4 or 5 years of age would effectively be rendered infertile for the remainder of their anticipated breeding life.</p>

In his testimony Mr Garland confirmed that the value of a breeding bird reflects its pedigree in the sense of whether it is itself a race-winner or has produced a winner.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, I have decided against that course, not least because such a hearing would have been unlikely to have been before the autumn of 2025 given other court listings and consequential judgment-writing commitments.  The parties have chosen to shoehorn into their trial dozens of allegations (the harassment cases) which, to the extent there was anything in them in terms of causes of action, would have been better suited to the Septic Tank Claim (either in its inception, or by amendment or by its compromise under the terms of the Tomlin Order). This claim was issued in the TCC in London (the Claim Form stating &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the claim should be heard in a specialist High Court list, namely TCC</span>&#8221;) and was transferred to the Property, Trust and Probate List in the Bristol BPC by the Order of Mr Moody KC dated 1 December 2023.  At earlier hearings, I was told (in connection with the defendants&#8217; later request that the trial before me should take place in Truro County Court for the convenience of the majority of the witnesses) the transfer to Bristol was made on the defendants&#8217; application.  My assumption is that the transfer to the Chancery Division reflected the more basic territorial aspects of the dispute and my distinct impression is that the transfer out of the TCC probably marked the point when the parties began to lose sight of the need to focus, both at the trial and well in advance of it, on the more technical and complex aspects of ROP&#8217;s claim, particularly its quantum.</p>

Although perhaps not atypical of a significant element of the work in that Chancery list, those might even have been better suited to non-specialist County Court proceedings.  That focus has come at the obvious expense of a more thorough analysis (both of the applicable legal principles and the evidence) of the quantum of ROP&#8217;s claim.  But that was the parties&#8217; choice and, echoing my comments above about the ongoing analysis of the late produced ROP&#8217;s Summary and Dr Forbes&#8217;s Supplemental Report in response, there is only so much they can reasonably expect of the court after a trial on other issues they have chosen to explore at some length.  The interests of other litigants in the Bristol BPC is at odds with a proposal that the assessment of quantum of ROP&#8217;s damages (over and above the &#163;200,000 in respect of the dead birds) should be the subject of a further hearing. </p>

It does not have to be persuaded that the precise amount it decides upon has been proved on the balance of probabilities.

It has been established in other contexts that this does not require him to show a 51% or better chance it would have happened. Instead, if that standard of proof threshold has been passed in establishing that relevant loss has been suffered (a finding of fact) then the court&#8217;s quantification of it is a matter for an evaluative judgment (one addressing the chances of a hypothetical fact): see <span style="font-style:italic">Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons (a firm)</span> [1995] 1 WLR 1602 and <span style="font-style:italic">Perry v Raleys Solicitors</span> [2019] UKSC 5; [2020] AC 352.  Where, as here, the contingencies are interdependent or overlapping (one cannot have a chick later hatching without an egg first being laid) it is not appropriate to multiply the chances to produce a final figure. Instead, the court makes an evaluative judgment as to the overall figure: see <span style="font-style:italic">AssetCo Plc v Grant Thornton UK LLP</span> [2019] EWHC 150 (Comm); [2019] Bus LR 229, at [432]-[449]; [2020] EWCA Civ 1151; [2021] Bus LR 142 at [207]-[209].</p>

I base this on there being a real chance that the breeding pairs in each of those pens would otherwise have produced a hatch of eggs.  I estimate that hypothetical hatch at 7 eggs across the two pens (4 plus 3) and I evaluate the chance of those eggs successfully hatching at approximately 70%.

Mr Thomas&#8217;s solicitors headed their letter &#8216;Septic tank and land drains at Bosavern Manor&#8217; and they referred to the soakaway system being on title number CL 184450 (the land purchased by UCE in October 2020) albeit that its precise location was a matter of disagreement between the parties.  This was written after the damage to the soakaway system in January 2021.   Yet in his testimony Mr Thomas said he could not accept a soakaway existed.

It is clear from the terms of his witness statement that he had made in circumstances where he understood it had been said he had been guilty of criminal damage (he said that Mr Thomas had sent him a text with a quote from a solicitors&#8217; letter which said as much).

He would then have avoided it or, if too late to avoid it, noticed it.  Yet his evidence is that he was unaware of it.  By reference to the evidence of Mr Semmens, I accept Mr Thomas&#8217;s evidence that he also did not have such damage in mind and had simply asked Mr Semmens to move soil from the levelling of the area for UCE&#8217;s barn to another part of its land.</p>

On the first occasion Scott and Roger Nicholas retrieved the cover from Mr Thomas&#8217;s yard.  No good reason has been put forward by Mr Thomas for this repeated act.  The Drain is on UCE&#8217;s land and, so he believes, Roger Nicholas was draining household water into it. His actions appear to be part of his preoccupation with the wider issues of drainage (including to the septic tank on Mr Joint&#8217;s land) that he inherited on UCE&#8217;s purchase of the land and his preferred use of the Lane to gain access to Pengelly.  In the trial bundle there were some photographs of the Drain, with the cover removed, which showed some bubbles in the water beneath the drain pipe in it, and it was suggested by Mr Thomas and Mr Ambler that these were soap suds.  In the Septic Tank Claim Mr Thomas alleged that Martin and Karen (though not Roger Nicholas) were draining waste water from their kitchen into the drain and the ditch below and he sought an injunction to prevent that.  However, as Martin explained in his evidence to me this allegation has never been supported by evidence and has been shown to be unfounded both by Building Control and the Environment Agency who dye-tested the water and established that only rainwater was entering the Drain.  There is no evidence to suggest that the piped connection to the Drain has been altered since the summer of 2021, when Roger Nicholas made a connection between the inlet and outlet using a slotted pipe as he said he was concerned that Mr Thomas&#8217;s removal of the cover signalled an intention to fill in the drain with gravel. By the Tomlin Order in the Septic Tank Proceedings the Nicholases were content to agree that the Drain was for rainwater only and not domestic water.</p>

I find this allegation (which in part involves Mr Thomas acting maliciously) has not been proved. It was supported only by the hearsay evidence of Martin (reporting what Karen Nicholas had seen and identifying Archie Pilcher) and, not having been addressed in Mr Pilcher&#8217;s statement, it was not a point picked up by Karen Nicholas in her (responsive only) witness statement.  Although Martin did receive a visit from the Trading Standards Officer soon after this alleged event, who indicated that Mr Thomas was perhaps behind it, Mr Pilcher denied that he had emptied ROP&#8217;s bin bags to enable Mr Thomas to make a complaint to Trading Standards.  I feel unable to reject that denial when Karen Thomas did not give evidence on the point.</p>

He is likely to have incurred some legal costs in relation to what became the Septic Tank Claim but the sign read as if he had been thwarted for 2021 in running the more substantial glamping business he intended on UCE&#8217;s land. Yet he confirmed in his testimony that he did not have planning permission for that, as opposed to camping for no more than 56 days which did not need planning permission. With its reference to pollution the sign was expressed in curious terms if it was to attract any campers for 2021.  Mr Thomas&#8217;s confirmed that no campers came in 2021.  I find that the real purpose of the sign was to ramp up the hostility between the neighbours over what was to become the Septic Tank Claim.</p>

The factual allegation of stacking of silage bales has been proved (and not disputed) but I do not accept this was an act of harassment, done with the purpose of blocking a sea view from Scott&#8217;s family home.

The evidence (including a photograph of Scott&#8217;s home in 2021 covered by scaffolding and plastic sheeting identified by Mr Thomas in cross-examination) indicates that Scott and his family were not living in the house at the time of its renovation but instead in a caravan on the other side of the sea view. I have taken account of the fact that, in response to Scott saying that the Braggs&#8217; property had holiday bookings for April to September that year, Mr Thomas responded with a WhatsApp message on 27 February 2021 saying &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">They won&#8217;t want to come with no sea view &#8230;</span>.&#8221;  This probably related to his plans for a peacock house behind the Braggs&#8217; property, though he told me in evidence that the rook of the peacock house is not materially higher than the hedge behind their property.</p>

This allegation has been proved in relation to the removal of the kerbing but not the alleged resulting flooding. It relates to the removal of some kerbing across the Lane installed to direct rainwater to the Drain (which took place on 3 May not 11 May 2022 as pleaded). Roger Nicholas explained that the kerbing had been installed to direct rainwater into the storm drain.  He said that it helped to avoid flooding of his property and the property on the other side of the Lane. Mr Thomas instructed Ed McFadden to remove the kerbing (Mr McFadden having been asked by Karen Nicholas to discontinue groundworks for UCE&#8217;s barn the previous day, the Bank Holiday).   The evidence indicates that Susan and Roger Nicholas&#8217;s property flooded soon after when a water connection to some troughs in UCE&#8217;s fields was reinstated by Mr McFadden.  Martin sought to explain in his evidence that when building works were done to his and his parents&#8217; property, some years before UCE acquired the land, they connected to a water supply with the tenant farmer&#8217;s permission (on the basis that they would cap off the supply once the works were finished) and the flooding in May 2022 indicated that, for their permanent water supply, the properties had been mistakenly connected to the water supply for the fields.  Adrian Thomas gave evidence to the same effect.</p>

I refer to the video of the January 2025 confrontation; the evidence in relation to paragraph (35) that Scott would probably have been prepared to stand up to Adrian Thomas (if not advised against that by his father); and the fact that, when he curtailed his WhatsApp communications with Mr Thomas (over allegation (16)) Scott felt able to say: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Fuck off prick, you&#8217;re a hateful and hated cunt</span>.&#8221;  However, I am not persuaded that a case of either brother being sufficiently alarmed or distressed by targeted and oppressive conduct is made out.</p>

If I had reached the contrary conclusion the damages award would have been very modest (I would have had in mind a figure of &#163;2,000 for each of Martin and Scott) and, for the reasons explained in Section C(3) above, nothing like the level of damages claimed by them.</p>

My finding in relation to allegations (7) and (24) does provide a potential basis for the future grant of injunctive relief but, as with my decision above in relation to the injunction sought to prevent further acts of nuisance, both parties would be best advised to first consider the implications of this judgment before any further actions are taken in relation to the Drain.  They were able to agree a Tomlin Order in settlement of the Septic Tank Claim, even though they have yet to fully implement it, and they should explore doing so in relation to the Drain.  I am not prepared to grant an injunction in the wide terms sought which dictates what may not be done with the Drain for so long as the Lane remains in UCE&#8217;s ownership.</p>

I have found that the claimants&#8217; competing allegation of harassment through Mr Thomas&#8217;s erection of the sign has been proved.  In the light of my reasons for that finding it cannot be said that removing the sign was an act of harassment.</p>

This allegation of harassment has not been proved. The allegation (pleaded in vague terms) appears to relate to an incident when Scott was using a mini excavator to raise the level of the shared access over UCE&#8217;s land which would prevent rainwater running into his garage.  I was shown a photograph taken by Mr Thomas of Scott at work.  Scott said that when they were on speaking terms he had told Mr Thomas of his intention to put in some kerb stones for that purpose. He accepted that he had not told Mr Thomas he intended to do the work that day, 6 November 2021, when he brought approximately 5 tonnes of material on to the accessway to create the water barrier.  Scott accepted he did confront Mr Thomas with his concern that he was also photographing his children.  He denied he was threatening or abusive.  The contrary case was not put to him in cross-examination with any specificity and has not been made out.</p>

This allegation of harassment has not been proved.  I prefer Mr Brady&#8217;s evidence (about the nature and extent of his unsuccessful attempt to speak to Mr Thomas on 5 May 2022 in Field No. 8440) over the evidence of Mr Thomas and Archie Pilcher (and the less direct evidence about a &#8220;chase&#8221; given by Sarah Thomas which suggested that Mr Brady&#8217;s pursuit continued to Nanquidno Farm).  Mr Brady did attempt to speak to Mr Thomas but did not, I find, use threatening language of wanting to speak to him in the corner of a field or continue the attempt (which was not the hot pursuit suggested by Mr Thomas given that his powerful Range Rover had a head start over the van in which Mr Brady was being driven) for very long after he had got on to the B3306.  </p>

As she said in evidence that she had given those in a van a welcoming look, if it had been Mr Brady that would probably have encouraged him to have stopped to ask if she had seen two men in a Range Rover.  The evidence of Adrian Thomas also indirectly supports Mr Brady&#8217;s account, in that it is clear from my assessment of Adrian Thomas&#8217;s character that if he had remained persuaded of his initial understanding that Mr Thomas and Mr Pilcher had had to hide from Mr Brady in a hay field (the reason why Adrian Thomas had turned up at Broadlands in an angry state until Mr Brady calmed him down) I do not believe he would have had anything further to do with Mr Brady.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Allegation (4)</span>.  This allegation of harassment has not been proved in that I do not accept that preventing Mr Thomas&#8217;s exit for no more than a couple of minutes or so was an act of harassment. A video of this incident (taken by Sarah Thomas as a passenger in Mr Thomas&#8217;s car about to leave UCE&#8217;s land for the B3306) was shown to the court and supports the facts alleged. I have already made passing reference to it in addressing Mr Brady&#8217;s evidence.  Mr Brady accepted that the parking of the car on the accessway was part of an attempt to speak to Mr Thomas and the video shows him coming towards Mr Thomas&#8217;s driver&#8217;s window.  Mr Thomas told Mr Brady that he did not want to speak to him and that he should speak to Mr Thomas&#8217;s solicitor. Mr Brady went away and moved the car. In my judgment the video evidence undermines Mr Thomas&#8217;s pleaded case that he &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">reasonably felt extremely threatened by Mr Brady</span>.&#8221; The video gives no impression of him feeling threatened and it certainly provides no basis for concluding that would have been a reasonable reaction to Mr Brady&#8217;s acts.  Mr Neave-Hill was also in Mr Thomas&#8217;s car, as a passenger in the back seat.  His evidence was that he was anxious, and annoyed, not because of anything Mr Brady said but because the access had been temporarily blocked.  He confirmed that Mr Brady walked away when told by Mr Thomas to go through a solicitor and that any anxiety on his part dissipated at that point.  This evidence also fails to support the pleaded allegation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Allegation (5)</span>. This allegation of harassment has not been proved in that I do not accept the temporary blocking of access, in the particular circumstances, was an act of harassment. Mr Brady accepted that he had caused a car to be parked so as to prevent Mr Thomas&#8217;s builders from gaining access, but not otherwise. Mr Brady said he had done this so that he could ask them what work they intended to do that day as, if it was near the Aviary, it would cause the birds problems.  There is a video of part of this incident, which I have also mentioned above, and which records the act of blocking but no more than that.  The evidence of Declan Prowse, one of the builders, indicates that their access was blocked for about 20 minutes before the police arrived. Mr Prowse said Mr Brady referred to health and safety officers and representatives of the Council coming to the site.  It is not alleged that on this occasion Mr Brady caused anyone to feel threatened and the video does not support such an allegation.  If anything, it shows that Adrian Thomas had arrived in an angry state and referred to Mr Brady as a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">goon</span>&#8221;. Although not recorded on video, I accept Mr Brady&#8217;s evidence that Adrian Thomas was extremely aggressive, and looking for confrontation, and called Mr Brady a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">twat</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a drunken, whisky-drinking Scottish cunt</span>.&#8221; Mr Brady said he gave a statement to the police when they arrived and that, when they asked where Adrian Thomas was, one of the builders said he had gone to the lake.</p>
