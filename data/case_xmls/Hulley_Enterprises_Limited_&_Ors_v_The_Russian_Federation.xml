	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue on this appeal is whether the principle of issue estoppel applies to the determination by an English court whether one of the exceptions to state immunity set out in sections 2 to 11 of the State Immunity Act 1978 applies. Specifically, when a foreign court has decided that a state has agreed in writing to submit a dispute to arbitration, and the usual conditions for the application of issue estoppel are satisfied, can the English court treat that decision as giving rise to an issue estoppel or must it determine the issue for itself without regard to the decision of the foreign court?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mrs Justice Cockerill held that there was an issue estoppel precluding the Russian Federation (&#8216;Russia&#8217;) from re-arguing the question whether it had agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration, with the consequence that Russia&#8217;s challenge to the jurisdiction of the English court on the ground of state immunity should be dismissed. Russia challenges that conclusion, contending that issue estoppel has no application in these circumstances.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have concluded that the appeal should be dismissed. In short, I accept the submission of Mr Jonathan Crow CVO KC for the respondent claimants that although the State Immunity Act 1978 sets out comprehensively the exceptions to state immunity, it does not prescribe how the court should decide whether any of the exceptions applies in any given case. That question must be decided applying the ordinary principles of English law, both substantive and procedural, and those principles include the principle of issue estoppel.</p>

Yves Fortier CC QC, Dr Charles Poncet and Judge Stephen Schwebel) issued three materially identical awards declaring that Russia had breached its obligations under Article 13(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty and ordering it to pay damages exceeding a total of US $50 billion plus interest to the claimants (the respondents to this appeal), who are the former majority shareholders in OAO Yukos Oil Company.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2014 Russia commenced proceedings to set aside the awards in the courts of the Netherlands, the arbitral seat. It did so on various grounds, including challenges relating to the jurisdiction of the tribunal and the conduct of the arbitration. One such challenge was that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction because there was no binding arbitration agreement between the claimants and Russia (&#8216;the no agreement issue&#8217;). Another was that the awards were vitiated by fraud as a result of the claimants having effectively bribed a witness to give evidence in their favour and failed to disclose key documents (&#8216;the procedural fraud issue&#8217;).</p>

Russia challenged the jurisdiction of the English court by an application filed on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2015.

Among other things, it rejected Russia&#8217;s challenge to the awards on the basis that there was no binding arbitration agreement between the claimants and Russia, holding there was such an agreement. This is the decision which is said by the claimants and was found by the judge to give rise to an issue estoppel.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Russia challenged the decision of the Hague Court of Appeal to reinstate the awards by a cassation appeal to the Dutch Supreme Court. While this challenge was pending, on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2020, the claimants applied to lift the stay of the English enforcement proceedings. Russia resisted that application, including (ironically in view of its present stance) on the basis that its arguments in the cassation appeal overlapped substantially with its challenge to the English jurisdiction, which was inefficient and created a risk of inconsistent judgments on the same issues. The application to lift the stay was rejected by Mr Justice Henshaw by a judgment dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2021 ([2021] EWHC 894 (Comm)).</p>

The court found that the Hague Court of Appeal&#8217;s rulings on Russia&#8217;s challenges to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal did not result in cassation (i.e. the decision of the Court of Appeal on these issues, including whether there was a binding arbitration agreement, was upheld), but that the Court of Appeal had erred on the issue of procedural fraud. Accordingly, the Supreme Court quashed the Court of Appeal&#8217;s judgments and referred the case to the Amsterdam Court of Appeal for further consideration and decision.</p>

For example, as I have explained, the standard of proof which must be satisfied if an exception is to be found to apply is the balance of probabilities, that is to say that it is more likely than not that the exception applies.

All states have an international law obligation to give effect to such immunity in accordance with that general rule.

Although there has been much debate regarding the origins of State immunity and the identification of the principles underlying that immunity in the past, the International Law Commission concluded in 1980 that the rule of State immunity had been &#8220;adopted as a general rule of customary international law solidly rooted in the current practice of States&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Yearbook of the International Law Commission</span>, 1980, Vol II (2), p. 147, para 26). That conclusion was based upon an extensive survey of State practice and, in the opinion of the Court, is confirmed by the record of national legislation, judicial decisions, assertions of a right to immunity and the comments of States on what became the United Nations Convention. That practice shows that, whether in claiming immunity for themselves or according it to others, States generally proceed on the basis that there is a right to immunity under international law, together with a corresponding obligation on the part of other States to respect and give effect to that immunity.&#8217;</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8216;I do not think that any estoppel in its common law concept arises in the present case. The particular type of estoppel relied upon by the husband is estoppel <span style="font-style:italic">per rem judicatam</span>. This is a generic term which in modern law includes two species. The first species, which I will call &#8220;cause of action estoppel&#8221;, is that which prevents a party to an action from asserting or denying as against the other party, the existence of a particular cause of action, the non-existence of or existence of which has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in previous litigation between the same parties. If the cause of action was determined to exist, i.e. judgment was given upon it, it is said to be merged in the judgment, or, for those who prefer Latin, <span style="font-style:italic">transit in rem judicatam</span>. If it was determined not to exist, the unsuccessful plaintiff can no longer assert that it does; he is estopped <span style="font-style:italic">per rem judicatam</span>. This is simply an application of the rule of public policy expressed in the Latin maxim &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa</span>&#8221;. In this application of the maxim &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">causa</span>&#8221; bears its literal Latin meaning. The second species, which I will call &#8220;issue estoppel&#8221;, is an extension of the same rule of public policy. There are many causes of action which can only be established by proving that two or more different conditions are fulfilled. Such causes of action involve as many separate issues between the parties as there are conditions to be fulfilled by the plaintiff in order to establish his cause of action; and there may be cases where the fulfilment of an identical condition is a requirement common to 2 or more different causes of action. If in litigation upon one such cause of action any of such separate issues as to whether a particular condition has been fulfilled is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, either upon evidence or upon admission by a party to the litigation, neither party can, in subsequent litigation between one another upon any cause of action which depends upon the fulfilment of the identical condition, assert that the condition was fulfilled if the court has in the first litigation determined that it was not, or deny that it was fulfilled if the court in the first litigation determined that it was.&#8217;</p>

First, Lord Justice Diplock distinguished issue estoppel from &#8216;other rules of law to which the label of &#8220;estoppel&#8221; is attached&#8217;. Second, when issue estoppel applies, that does not mean that there is no issue for the court to decide, but only that the issue estoppel means, as a matter of law, that there is no issue to which evidence contradicting the prior decision would be relevant &#8211; although I would add that when the issue estoppel arises from the judgment of a foreign court there will still need to be some evidence, for example to show what the foreign court decided and that its decision was final and conclusive on the issue in question. Issue estoppel is therefore a principle which enables the court to decide the issue in question, not a principle which prevents it from making any decision on the point.</p>

Their Lordships consider that, on the stated hypothesis [i.e. that the plea of issue estoppel was sound], the argument of European Re is correct. The Boyd award has conferred upon them a right which is enforceable by later pleading an issue estoppel. It is a species of the enforcement of the rights given by the award just as much as would be a cause of action estoppel. It is true that estoppels can be described as rules of evidence or as rules of public policy to stop the abuse of process by relitigation. But that is to look at how estoppels are given effect to not at what is the nature of the private law right which the estoppel recognises and protects. For example, a party who has attorned to another is estopped from denying that he holds the relevant goods for that other; the attornment has created a legal relationship and legal rights which the attorning party must recognise. The same applies to where arbitrators have, pursuant to the submission of a dispute to them, decided an issue; that decision then binds the parties and neither party can thereafter dispute that decision. &#8230;&#8217;   </p>

Issue estoppel, when it applies, renders this legally irrelevant. That will be the position in the present case if the plea of issue estoppel is upheld. One reason for ordering a preliminary issue in this case was that, if issue estoppel does apply, the delay and expense of a lengthy hearing to decide the no agreement issue will be avoided.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mrs Justice Cockerill acknowledged that there is no direct authority on the question whether the decision of a foreign court can give rise to an issue estoppel when the English court is deciding whether one of the exceptions to state immunity applies. She considered that there is nothing in the State Immunity Act 1978 itself to disapply substantive or procedural rules of English law, including issue estoppel, when the application of the exceptions has to be decided. She held that, in order for an issue estoppel to arise, the foreign judgment must satisfy the requirements for recognition contained in section 31 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 but that, if they are satisfied, there is no reason in principle why there cannot be an issue estoppel. Here, those requirements were satisfied because Russia had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Dutch court by initiating the proceedings in the Netherlands. Accordingly, if the Dutch court had applied rules corresponding to those contained in sections 2 to 11 of the State Immunity Act 1978, as required by section 31(1)(b) of the 1982 Act, it would have had jurisdiction.</p>

All of these matters were the subject of expert evidence. The judge considered that evidence in detail and concluded that the Dutch decisions did have <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> effect as a matter of Dutch law; that this was so notwithstanding that the procedural fraud issue remained live before the Dutch courts; and that there was no relevant issue of interpretation capable of being referred by the Dutch court to the CJEU.</p>

That question goes to the heart of [Russia&#8217;s] grounds 1-3. The short answer to it starts with the statutory text: the court is obliged to &#8216;give effect to the immunity conferred&#8217;. This court has recently confirmed that this provision requires: (a) that the English court must &#8216;determine, on a final and not merely interlocutory basis, whether the ground for immunity/loss of immunity exists&#8217; (<span style="font-style:italic">The Prestige (Nos. 3 &amp; 4)</span>); and (b) that this &#8216;determination&#8217; must establish &#8216;to the civil standard, [whether there is] an exemption to that immunity&#8217; (<span style="font-style:italic">Zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn</span>). [Russia&#8217;s] central submission in this appeal is that it must follow that, by section 1 SIA, an English court is under an obligation to consider all arguments for and against state immunity, weigh up the evidence underpinning them, and determine issues for itself. In other words, the English court must determine [the] question of the state&#8217;s immunity <span style="font-style:italic">de novo</span>, without deference to any purported issue estoppel.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">That conclusion may be tested by reference to the nature of issue estoppel. Issue estoppel operates as a bar to <span style="font-style:italic">parties</span> raising issues which have previously been determined against them (<span style="font-style:italic">Associated Electric &amp; Gas v European Re</span> at [13] to [15]). Where it applies, it does not result in the re-determination of an issue; indeed, per Lord Justice Diplock in <span style="font-style:italic">Mills v Cooper</span>, it &#8220;results in there being no issue&#8221; for determination <span style="font-style:italic">at all</span>. That being the case, a conclusion reached on the basis of an issue estoppel can neither be a determination, nor one reached on a balance of probabilities in accordance with the court&#8217;s obligation under section 1(2) SIA. Seen in that context, the judge&#8217;s observation that there is no English authority in support of the conclusion that issue estoppel applies in respect of a foreign judgment against a foreign state on an issue of state immunity is unsurprising.</p>

Contrary to the position taken by the respondents, that approach is consistent with principle. State immunity and issue estoppel are both important questions of public policy in England. Where an English court is faced with an irreconcilable tension between the two, proper consideration of state immunity must be given priority over issue estoppel. That is properly conceived as a threshold matter: where state immunity arises, the English court does not consider whether issue estoppel arises. Alternatively, state immunity may be considered as a &#8216;special circumstance&#8217; militating against the application of issue estoppel. Either way, the conclusion is the same: questions of state immunity must be determined without reference to issue estoppel.</p>

He accepted that issue estoppel could arise against a state other than on an issue of state immunity. He accepted also that issue estoppel could arise against a state on an issue of state immunity where the previous judgment was the judgment of an English (or perhaps United Kingdom) court as distinct from a foreign court. Accordingly the question of principle for decision is not whether the decision of a foreign court can create an issue estoppel against a state, but the narrower question whether the decision of a foreign court can create an issue estoppel to which effect will be given when the English court is deciding whether a state is immune from its jurisdiction.</p>

Russia&#8217;s case, therefore, is that there is something in the nature of the decision which the court has to make when deciding whether one of the exceptions to immunity applies under sections 2 to 11 of the State Immunity Act 1978 which rules out the application of issue estoppel in that particular context.</p>

I would accept that the English court has such an obligation. That is what the Act says.

On the contrary, she determined that it had so agreed, applying the substantive principle of English law that when the requirements for an issue estoppel are satisfied, as they were in this case, the previous decision of a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive on the issue in question. As explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Associated Electric &amp; Gas v European Re</span>, an issue estoppel creates a substantive right which is recognised and protected in English law.

In that case Nigeria challenged an arbitration award in favour of Zhongshan pursuant to section 67 of the Arbitration Act 1996, contending that the arbitrators did not have jurisdiction. However, when Zhongshan applied for security for costs and security for the award under section 70 of the Act, Nigeria discontinued its challenge. Zhongshan then issued an application to enforce the award under section 66 of the Act. The application was made without notice in accordance with CPR 62.18, but Zhongshan&#8217;s evidence drew attention to potential arguments which Nigeria might raise, including that it might rely on state immunity. The evidence explained why, in the deponent&#8217;s view, those arguments should not succeed. Mrs Justice Cockerill made the order for enforcement, but gave directions for Nigeria to apply to set it aside on the ground of state immunity if so advised. Nigeria failed to apply within the time specified, and then sought relief from sanction and an extension of time.</p>

In other words, when the judge made the enforcement order, she made a determination that, on the evidence before the Court, she was satisfied that the award should be enforced and that there was no arguable case for state immunity. There is nothing surprising in that conclusion given that Nigeria had raised issues of state immunity in the section 67 application which it had abandoned and to seek to raise the same issues again would arguably be an abuse of process. Of course, it was open to Nigeria, given that the order was made <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span>, to make an application to set aside the order on grounds of state immunity or any other grounds, but if it wished to do so, it had to comply with the procedural timetable laid down by the Court, which in fact gave a generous period of 74 days for such an application to be made. </p>

In the present case, Nigeria was given two months and fourteen days under the CPR to make an application to set aside the enforcement order and raise state immunity if so advised. If Nigeria needed more time to make an application, it was incumbent upon it to make an application in time under CPR 3.1(2)(a) for an extension of time. If such an application was not made in time (as in the present case) then Nigeria would need to seek relief from sanctions as the notes in the White Book make clear and, if it could not satisfy the <span style="font-style:italic">Denton</span> criteria (as the judge found here), then the sanction of not obtaining an extension of time would follow, so that Nigeria could not raise state immunity because it was too late.

Ostensible authority, which is a form of deemed authority where no actual authority exists, is a good example of that principle. However, issue estoppel, despite the presence of the word &#8216;estoppel&#8217;, is different. It is simply a convenient label for the legal principle that a previous decision of a court of competent jurisdiction creates an enforceable legal right in English law, which principle is based on the important public policy of finality in litigation. In this regard I have already drawn attention to the fact that Lord Justice Diplock in <span style="font-style:italic">Mills v Cooper</span> distinguished issue estoppel from other traditional forms of estoppel. In my judgment, therefore, to apply the principle of issue estoppel in deciding whether a state has agreed in writing to submit a dispute to arbitration does not offend against the rule that the court&#8217;s jurisdiction cannot be enlarged or created by an estoppel.</p>

This was said to lead to the conclusion that issue estoppel does not apply when the court is considering whether an exception to immunity applies, so that the court must consider this question without regard to the decision of the foreign court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not accept this submission. The public policy of the United Kingdom so far as state immunity is concerned is reflected in the provisions of the State Immunity Act 1978. When a question of state immunity arises, the court is obliged to give effect to those provisions, no more and no less. That means that it will need to decide whether an exception to immunity applies, applying the ordinary rules of English law. Although issue estoppel is founded on the principle of public policy that there should be finality in litigation, it is (as I have explained) a rule of substantive law. When a court decides that an exception to immunity applies as a result of an issue estoppel arising from a decision of a foreign court, it is simply applying that rule as part of English law. There is no question of making a choice between competing public policies. In any event, even if such a choice arose, it is difficult to see how giving effect to a foreign judgment against a state which satisfies the requirements for recognition and enforcement contained in section 31 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (which I consider further below) could offend against public policy.</p>

That case involved an application by Deutsche Telekom to enforce in Singapore a foreign arbitral award made against the Republic of India. The seat of the arbitration was Switzerland, where an application by the Republic of India to set aside the award on the basis that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction had been dismissed. The issue for decision in Singapore raised the question of how an enforcement court should treat an earlier decision of the seat court as to the validity of the award. The Singapore Court of Appeal held that the decision of the seat court gave rise to an issue estoppel. Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon gave the principal judgment, with which the other members of the court (including a former Deputy President of the United Kingdom Supreme Court and a former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia) agreed.

It should be noted that when dealing with the question of the enforcement of a foreign arbitral award, the New York Convention does not operate in isolation because the domestic law of the enforcement court also comes into play (<span style="font-style:italic">UNCITRAL Secretariat Guide on the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York, 1958)</span> (United Nations, 2016) at pp 2-3). The latter includes its conflict of laws rules and how it treats judgments that are relevant and rendered by other jurisdictions. Singapore&#8217;s conflict of laws rules include the principle of transnational issue estoppel that were laid down in <span style="font-style:italic">Merck Sharpe</span> [<span style="font-style:italic">Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp v Merck KGaA</span> [2021] 1 SLR 1102].

This is especially so because the IAA [International Arbitration Act] is silent on this issue, and what is not governed by it must necessarily be governed by the other rules of domestic law (see <span style="font-style:italic">Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the Work of its 18</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> Session </span>(UN Doc A/40/17/ 3-21 June 1985) at para 61).&#8217;</p>

Mr Flynn therefore has to submit, as he does, that the fact that the point arises on a claim for state immunity makes all the difference, and that the argument which he advances in the present case was missed not only by counsel, but by the distinguished members of the Singapore Court of Appeal.</p>

Once it is determined, as in this case, that an issue has been finally and conclusively decided by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction, after a fair hearing in proceedings initiated by the state in which the point was fully contested, and that the judgment of the foreign court would be entitled to recognition under section 31 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982, I see no reason why effect should not be given to the issue estoppel arising from that judgment. That applies with particular force in the arbitration context when the judgment of the foreign court is given in the arbitration seat, as in this case. To give effect to the issue estoppel arising from that judgment, rather than putting the award creditor to the trouble and expense of litigating the issue all over again, seems to me to be in accordance with the demands of justice. It is also in accordance with another important public policy, recognised internationally in the New York Convention, which is that awards, even against states, should be honoured without delay and without the kind of trench warfare seen in the present case. To apply the &#8216;overriding consideration&#8217; referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Carl Zeiss</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">The Good Challenger</span>, the application of issue estoppel in this case will work justice and not injustice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is nothing in the further matters raised as amounting to special circumstances, namely the fact that the issue of procedural fraud remains live in the Dutch proceedings and that there may be some possibility of a reference by the Dutch courts to the CJEU of an issue of interpretation of the Energy Charter Treaty. At the time when the judge dealt with these issues, the Dutch Supreme Court had remitted them to the Amsterdam Court of Appeal. As it happens, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal has now rejected Russia&#8217;s submissions on these issues. In circumstances where the only remaining issue in the Dutch proceedings is an issue of procedural fraud in the conduct of the arbitration, it is very hard to see how any issue of interpretation needing a reference to the CJEU could arise. Mr Flynn was unable to explain how it might. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In any event, whatever surviving possibility there may be that the Dutch Supreme Court will now reverse the decision of the Court of Appeal, or that there may be such a reference, these issues have nothing to do with the question whether Russia agreed in writing to submit the dispute to arbitration. That issue has been finally and conclusively determined by the Dutch courts, as the judge found, and that is not challenged by Russia on this appeal. In those circumstances the matters now relied on cannot provide a reason not to give effect to that determination by way of issue estoppel in deciding Russia&#8217;s challenge to the jurisdiction of the English court. Whether they may be relevant at any later stage of these proceedings is not a matter which we need to consider now.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">While I have concluded, in agreement with the judge, that there are no special circumstances in this case which would provide a reason not to give effect to the decision of the Dutch courts, it is relevant to note that the fact that the question of special circumstances needs to be considered demonstrates that the English court does not blindly follow the decision of the foreign court which is said to give rise to the issue estoppel. Instead it makes up its own mind whether special circumstances apply or, in other words, it considers for itself the overriding question whether the application of issue estoppel in any given case will work justice or injustice. As Mr Crow put it, the English court does not abdicate its responsibility to decide whether state immunity applies.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Flynn submitted, with respect somewhat faintly, that issues of interpretation of the Energy Charter Treaty arise in this case, and that this is a reason why the English court should decide for itself whether Russia has agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration, without regard to the decision of the Dutch courts. Ultimately, however, he accepted that this did not provide any reason in principle why issue estoppel should not apply if his primary submissions fail, but was merely a further reason why the English court should be cautious before giving effect to an issue estoppel.</p>

I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
