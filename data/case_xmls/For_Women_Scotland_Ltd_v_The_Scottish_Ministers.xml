	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This appeal is concerned with establishing the correct interpretation of the Equality Act 2010 (&#8220;the EA 2010&#8221;) which seeks to give statutory protection to people who are at risk of suffering from unlawful discrimination. The questions raised by this appeal directly affect women and members of the trans community. On the one hand, women have historically suffered from discrimination in our society and since 1975 have been given statutory protection against discrimination on the ground of sex. On the other hand, the trans community is both historically and currently a vulnerable community which Parliament has more recently sought to protect by statutory provision. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is not the role of the court to adjudicate on the arguments in the public domain on the meaning of gender or sex, nor is it to define the meaning of the word &#8220;woman&#8221; other than when it is used in the provisions of the EA 2010. It has a more limited role which does not involve making policy. The principal question which the court addresses on this appeal is the meaning of the words which Parliament has used in the EA 2010 in legislating to protect women and members of the trans community against discrimination. Our task is to see if those words can bear a coherent and predictable meaning within the EA 2010 consistently with the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (&#8220;the GRA 2004&#8221;).</p>

We are content to draw on the terminology used by the Scottish Ministers in their written case for the purposes of this judgment and have adopted the following terms. A person who is a biological man, ie who was at birth of the male sex, but who has the protected characteristic of gender reassignment is described as a &#8220;trans woman&#8221;. Similarly, a person who is a biological woman, ie who was at birth of the female sex, but who has the protected characteristic of gender reassignment is described as a &#8220;trans man&#8221;. We describe trans women and trans men who have obtained a gender recognition certificate (&#8220;GRC&#8221;) under the GRA 2004 as &#8220;trans women with a GRC&#8221; and &#8220;trans men with a GRC&#8221; respectively and their gender resulting from the GRC as their &#8220;acquired gender&#8221; or &#8220;acquired sex&#8221;.</p>

The central question on this appeal is whether the EA 2010 treats a trans woman with a GRC as a woman for all purposes within the scope of its provisions, or when that Act speaks of a &#8220;woman&#8221; and &#8220;sex&#8221; it is referring to a biological woman and biological sex.</p>

More recently, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead stated: &#8216;Statutory interpretation is an exercise which requires the court to identify the meaning borne by the words in question in the particular context&#8217; (<span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, Ex p Spath Holme Ltd </span>[2001] 2 AC 349, 396). Words and passages in a statute derive their meaning from their context. A phrase or passage must be read in the context of the section as a whole and in the wider context of a relevant group of sections. Other provisions in a statute and the statute as a whole may provide the relevant context. They are the words which Parliament has chosen to enact as an expression of the purpose of the legislation and are therefore the primary source by which meaning is ascertained. There is an important constitutional reason for having regard primarily to the statutory context as Lord Nicholls explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Spath Holme</span>, 397: &#8216;Citizens, with the assistance of their advisers, are intended to be able to understand parliamentary enactments, so that they can regulate their conduct accordingly. They should be able to rely upon what they read in an Act of Parliament.&#8217;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">External aids to interpretation therefore must play a secondary role. Explanatory Notes, prepared under the authority of Parliament, may cast light on the meaning of particular statutory provisions. Other sources, such as Law Commission reports, reports of Royal Commissions and advisory committees, and Government White Papers may disclose the background to a statute and assist the court to identify not only the mischief which it addresses but also the purpose of the legislation, thereby assisting a purposive interpretation of a particular statutory provision. The context disclosed by such materials is relevant to assist the court to ascertain the meaning of the statute, whether or not there is ambiguity and uncertainty, and indeed may reveal ambiguity or uncertainty: <span style="font-style:italic">Bennion, Bailey and Norbury on Statutory Interpretation</span>, 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ed (2020), para 11.2. But none of these external aids displace the meanings conveyed by the words of a statute that, after consideration of that context, are clear and unambiguous and which do not produce absurdity. &#8230;</p>

But where there is sufficient doubt about the specific meaning of the words used which the court must resolve, the indicators of the legislature&#8217;s purpose outside the provision in question, including the external aids described in para 30 of <span style="font-style:italic">R (O)</span> quoted above, must be given significant weight. As Lord Sales has stated in an extra-judicial writing, &#8220;sometimes the purpose for which legislative intervention was required may be the very prominent focus for the legislative activity which follows from it, and thus may frame in a particularly strong way the context in which that activity takes place&#8221; (see <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The role of purpose in legislative interpretation: inescapable but problematic necessity&#8221;</span>, Presentation at the Oxford University and University of Notre Dame Seminar on Public Law Theory: Topics in Legal Interpretation, 19 September 2024). Such aids can explain the meaning of a statutory provision which is open to doubt and can themselves alert the court to ambiguity in the provision, but they cannot displace the meanings conveyed by the clear and unambiguous words of a provision construed in the context of the statute as a whole.</p>

The attainment of this objective is carefully circumscribed by section 4 which makes clear that preference can be given to a woman in order to further that objective only where there is no best candidate and only if the appointment of an equally qualified male candidate cannot be justified on the basis of his particular characteristics or situation.

The appellant was successful on appeal before the Second Division of the Inner House of the Court of Session (<span style="font-style:italic">For Women Scotland Ltd v Lord Advocate</span> [2022] CSIH 4; 2022 SC 150), which in para 40 of its judgment dated 18 February 2022 held that &#8220;transgender women&#8221; is not a protected characteristic under the EA 2010 and that the definition of &#8220;woman&#8221; adopted in the 2018 Act &#8220;impinges on the nature of protected characteristics which is a reserved matter&#8221;. By interlocutor dated 22 March 2022 the Second Division declared that the definition of &#8220;woman&#8221; in section 2 of the 2018 Act was outside the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. In other words, because the definition of &#8220;woman&#8221; in section 2 of the 2018 Act included trans women as defined, it went beyond the scope of the exception permitted by section L2 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act; it therefore purported to legislate in respect of a reserved matter, namely equal opportunities, and so was outside the competence of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

This guidance operated on the premise that the decision of the Second Division had nullified the definition of &#8220;woman&#8221; in section 2 of the 2018 Act. Instead, the Scottish Ministers asserted that a person who had been issued with a full GRC that her acquired gender was female, had the sex of a woman so that her appointment would count towards the achievement of the 50% objective. As explained below, this stance was consistent with the advice given by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (&#8220;EHRC&#8221;), which is the non-departmental public body in Great Britain with responsibility for promoting and enforcing equality and non-discrimination laws in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

In a carefully reasoned judgment dated 13 December 2022 ([2022] CSOH 90; 2023 SC 61), she dismissed the petition. She rejected the appellant&#8217;s argument that the Inner House&#8217;s decision in the first judicial review had authoritatively determined that &#8220;sex&#8221; in the EA 2010 was confined to biological sex only (para 44). She held that section 9(1) of the GRA 2004 had the effect that a GRC changed a person&#8217;s sex for all purposes, stating that the language of section 9 of the GRA 2004 &#8220;could scarcely be clearer&#8221; (para 45). She rejected the appellant&#8217;s submission that the GRA 2004 had a narrow purpose which had been largely superseded by subsequent legislation, including legislation establishing the legality of same sex marriage. She observed that the GRA 2004 listed exceptions to the rule in section 9(1), such as marriage, parenthood, succession, peerages and trusts, and stated that the founding principle of section 9 of the GRA 2004 is a broad one: &#8220;that the acquired gender becomes the person&#8217;s sex &#8216;for all purposes&#8217; subject to any other enactments, or the statutory exceptions listed&#8221; (para 47). Lady Haldane rejected the submissions (i) that there was a conflict between the GRA 2004 and the EA 2010, which she stated was &#8220;drafted in full awareness of the 2004 Act, and its ambit&#8221; (para 50), and (ii) that the EA 2010 impliedly repealed or disapplied section 9(1) of the GRA 2004 (para 52). As a result, &#8220;sex&#8221; in the EA 2010 was not confined to biological sex but includes the acquired sex of those who possess a GRC obtained under the GRA 2004. Lady Haldane therefore concluded that the revised guidance of the Scottish Ministers on the 2018 Act was lawful.</p>

The Second Division, agreeing with Lady Haldane, held that the GRA 2004 was a far-reaching enactment which created a mechanism by which a person could change his or her sex in the eyes of the law. The judgment (para 42) stated that section 9(1), (2) and (3) of the GRA 2004 read together meant that a person with a GRC &#8220;acquires the opposite gender for all purposes unless there is a specific exception in the GRA [2004]; or unless the terms and context of a subsequent enactment require a different interpretation to follow&#8221;.

The terms &#8220;sex&#8221; and &#8220;gender&#8221; were often used interchangeably in the EA 2010. The provisions of the GRA 2004 and the EA 2010 could be interpreted consistently for the purposes of both statutes if the wider meaning were adopted. There was nothing in the EA 2010 that mandated a contrary conclusion. The Second Division then considered various provisions of the EA 2010 which the appellant argued were unworkable if the wider meaning of those words were adopted in section 11 of that Act. As we will be discussing those provisions below, it is sufficient at this stage to state that the provisions which the Second Division discussed related to: (i) the Armed Forces (Schedule 9), (ii) separate and single-sex spaces (section 29 and paragraphs 26 and 27 of Schedule 3), (iii) single-sex schools and institutions (Schedules 11 and 12), (iv) communal accommodation (paragraph 3 of Schedule 23), and (v) pregnancy and maternity (sections 4, 17 and 18). Of those provisions the Second Division held that only those relating to pregnancy and maternity might require a narrow interpretation of &#8220;woman&#8221; as meaning a biological woman. The Second Division also considered and rejected the submission that treating a trans woman as a woman under the EA 2010 would interfere with the right of freedom of association for lesbians. It concluded that persons with a GRC possess under section 11 the protected characteristic of sex according to the terms of their GRC as well as the protected characteristic of gender reassignment under section 7. The Second Division concluded that the Guidance on the 2018 Act was lawful because a person with a GRC in the female gender is a &#8220;woman&#8221; for the purposes of section 11 of the EA 2010.</p>

The EHRC recognises that the wider definition which it favours causes difficulties and impairs the operation of the EA 2010 in four areas: (i) discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity (sections 17 and 18); (ii) the protection against sexual orientation discrimination (section 12(1)(a)) and in particular the risk that lesbians and gay men for whom the biological aspect of their same sex attraction is defining, might be precluded from forming associations which exclude trans women and trans men respectively; (iii) single-sex services (paragraphs 26-28 of Schedule 3), and (iv) communal accommodation (paragraph 3 of Schedule 23).

Section 6(2) made it unlawful to discriminate against an employed woman in the way that access to opportunities for promotion, training or other services were offered or by dismissing her. There were several exceptions to the prohibition in section 6 which were designed to establish the boundary between the SDA 1975 and the Equal Pay Act 1970. Broadly, subsections (4) to (7) of section 6 excepted discrimination as regards pay and pensions from this prohibition on the basis that differential treatment of this kind would be dealt with under the Equal Pay Act 1970. </p>

The exception for small employers was repealed by the Sex Discrimination Act 1986 and the private household exception re-enacted in a much narrower form by section 1(2) of the 1986 Act, limiting it to where objection might reasonably be taken by a person living in the home to physical or social contact with someone of the opposite sex.</p>

Further the Act made some textual amendments to earlier legislation which assumed that all employees in occupations covered by that legislation would be men. For example, the provision in the Mines and Quarries Act 1954 which provided that no female should be employed below ground at a mine was modified to apply only to jobs where the duties ordinarily required the employee to spend a significant proportion of his time below ground: see section 21(1) of the SDA 1975. The language used in the Coal Mines Regulation Act 1908 was also modified to reflect the fact that women might now be employed; for the words &#8220;workman&#8221; or &#8220;man&#8221; there were substituted &#8220;worker&#8221;: section 21(2).</p>

In other areas, such as insurance and pension schemes, there was nothing to prevent the parties to a contract from agreeing that the person concerned should be treated as a man or a woman, as the case may be: p 105. But marriage was a relationship between a man and a woman and, in the context of marriage, even if not for other purposes, the person was still a biological male.

The applicant (a biological male employee) was dismissed by Cornwall County Council after telling her employer that she intended to undergo gender reassignment surgery. She complained of unlawful discrimination on the grounds of her sex. The Judge Rapporteur recorded that the industrial tribunal &#8220;found that there was no remedy under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the applicable United Kingdom statute, since English law took cognisance only of situations in which men or women were treated differently because they belonged to one sex or the other, and did not recognise a transsexual condition in addition to the two sexes. Under English law, the applicant was at all times a male&#8221; (para 7). The Court at para 18 held that the Directive was &#8220;simply the expression, in the relevant field, of the principle of equality, which is one of the fundamental principles of Community law&#8221;. The right not to be discriminated against on grounds of sex was, the Court said, a fundamental human right and accordingly the Directive also applied to discrimination arising from gender reassignment (para 20). </p>

Rather, the prohibition on discriminating against a woman now prohibited direct discrimination as defined by section 2A, namely on the grounds of gender reassignment, but only in the employment field. It was therefore unlawful under section 6 for A to discriminate against a woman in the ways caught by section 6 on the ground that she intended to undergo or was undergoing or had undergone gender reassignment. In light of section 2 of the SDA 1975, this also made it unlawful under section 6 for A to discriminate against a man if A treated him less favourably on that ground. However, the subsections of section 6 which prevented the overlap with the Equal Pay Act 1970 were disapplied so that discrimination in respect of pay and pensions on the grounds of gender reassignment was prohibited under section 6: see the new section 6(8) inserted by regulation 3(1) of the 1999 Regulations. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Goodwin</span>, the applicant&#8217;s biological sex was male but she had undergone gender reassignment surgery. The ECtHR held that it was a breach of the applicant&#8217;s right to respect for private life under article 8 of the Convention for there to be no legal recognition of her acquired gender. The ECtHR described the applicant as having initially undergone hormone therapy, grooming classes and voice training and as having &#8220;lived fully as a woman&#8221; since 1985. She later underwent gender reassignment surgery at a National Health Service hospital. The Court referred to various difficulties faced by the applicant because of the failure of the law to recognise her acquired gender. These included her inability to change her birth certificate, and different treatment as regards social security and national insurance issues, pensions and employment. The Court recognised that it had previously held that UK law did not interfere with respect for private life: para 73. But in the light of the then social conditions, it reassessed the appropriate application of the Convention. </p>

Yet there was no legal recognition of her changed status in law. The Court discussed medical evidence about the causes of what it called &#8220;transsexualism&#8221; and noted that the vast majority of Contracting States, including the UK, provided treatment including irreversible surgery. However, the ongoing debate about the exact causes of the condition were of diminished relevance because &#8220;given the numerous and painful interventions involved in such surgery and the level of commitment and conviction required to achieve a change in social gender role&#8221; it could not be suggested that there was &#8220;anything arbitrary or capricious in the decision taken by a person to undergo gender re-assignment&#8221;: para 81.</p>

In that case the Court held that it was a breach of article 8 to make legal recognition of a person&#8217;s transgender status conditional on sterilisation surgery or on treatment which entailed a very high probability of sterility: see para 120 of the judgment. The Court noted that imposing such a pre-condition presented transgender persons &#8220;with an impossible dilemma&#8221; if they did not want to undergo sterilisation surgery or treatment. That condition amounted to a violation of article 8. However, there was no breach of article 8 in requiring a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. There was at that time near-unanimity amongst Contracting States in requiring such a diagnosis and imposing that requirement did not infringe article 8: see para 140. </p>

The notes give as an example of the effect of section 9(1), that a trans man with a GRC would be entitled to protection from discrimination as a woman under the SDA 1975. In our view, this is a good illustration of why the use to which the courts should put explanatory notes is limited to the context of the legislation and the mischief to which its provisions are aimed: see Lord Steyn in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Westminster City Council) v National Asylum Support Service</span> [2002] UKHL 38, [2002] 1 WLR 2956, para 5 and the passages from <span style="font-style:italic">R (O)</span> cited earlier. There is nothing in the notes to suggest that the department had undertaken the kind of detailed analysis of the effect of such a change on the operation of provisions of the SDA 1975, as amended by the 1999 Regulations, that we have undertaken in the following sections of this judgment before giving that as an example of the effect of section 9(1). </p>

The amendments made to sections 7A and 7B disapplied the exceptions for GOQs and supplementary GOQs in those sections if the discrimination was against a person whose gender had become the acquired gender under the GRA 2004. The effect of the amendments made by Schedule 6 is to add a provision removing the exception &#8211; so discrimination is not permitted &#8211; where the discrimination is against a person whose gender has become the acquired gender under the GRA 2004. In our judgment these provisions say nothing about the intended effect more generally of section 9(1) on the meaning of the terms &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;woman&#8221; in the SDA 1975. In any event, the provisions regarding GOQs in sections 7A and 7B as amended were not carried forward into the EA 2010. Schedule 9 to that Act made fresh provision for GOQs. </p>

The medical practitioner practising in the field who supplies the report should include details of the process followed and evidence considered over a period of time to make the diagnosis in the applicant&#8217;s case. Nor is it sufficient to use the broad phrase &#8216;gender reassignment surgery&#8217; without indicating what surgery has been carried out. Nor should relevant treatments be omitted, such as hormone therapy. These requirements are particularly pertinent in assisting the Panel to be satisfied not only that the applicant has or has had gender dysphoria but also has lived in the acquired gender for at least two years and intends to live in that gender until death.</p>

She argued this infringed her article 8 rights because applicants could be issued with a certificate without having undergone surgery and without therefore having to provide such details. The challenge was rejected. Thirlwall J accepted that the requirement to provide medical details engaged the article 8 right to respect for private life. However, where an applicant had undergone surgery, or planned to do so, that fact was highly relevant, if not central, to the application and was plainly necessary to the Panel&#8217;s consideration of the criteria in section 2(1)(a) to (c) of the GRA 2004.

The issue was whether she could be refused appointment as a police officer because in the chief constable&#8217;s view she was not able to carry out intimate searches of either men or women. She could not search men because she presented as a woman and she could not search women because she was male as a matter of law. In her speech, Lady Hale said at para 61 that the applicant &#8220;has done everything that she possibly could do to align her physical identity with her psychological identity. She has lived successfully as a woman for many years. She has taken the appropriate hormone treatment and concluded a programme of surgery.

She also referred to the hormone treatment and testosterone blocking medication that she had taken except for a short period. The Court criticised the Panel&#8217;s decision letter for failing to analyse properly the evidence supporting the applicant&#8217;s assertion that she had been &#8220;living in the acquired gender&#8221;. The decision had not referred to the passport, deed polls or bank account statements and had not given any reasons as to why they were dissatisfied with this evidence. The Court held that the Panel had erred in considering only the medical evidence on the question of whether she had been living as a woman: para 62.

Although she had for a limited time some years before stopped hormone treatment in order to retain some male sexual function, all the other material, including important official documents, indicated a consistent course of conduct in living her life as female. The Court recorded that further evidence had been provided to enable the Court to make a decision whether to issue her with a GRC in the event that the Panel&#8217;s decision was set aside. This included a statement that &#8220;she has lived as a female since 2012 to the extent that she believes that many of her friends and acquaintances would not know that she had been born male&#8221;: para 76. The Court issued a GRC. The Court did not therefore address the question whether, if AB&#8217;s evidence showed that she complied with the guidance because her official documents used female names and pronouns but that she did not &#8220;present&#8221; as female or occupy a stable female social role, she would have satisfied the criteria that she was living as a woman and that she intended to continue to do so.</p>

We do not draw any inference from this as to the intended breadth of the rule set out in section 9(1).

Given the diminished relevance of the GRA 2004 to the rights of transgender people, the appellant argues that the rule in section 9(1) is also largely spent. </p>

Although many provisions of the GRA 2004 have been overtaken by other legislative developments, we consider that the Act continues to have relevance and importance in providing for legal recognition of the rights of transgender people. This recognition of their changed status has practical effects for individual rights and freedoms (including, for example, in the context of marriage, pensions, retirement and social security) but also in recognising their personal autonomy and dignity and avoiding unacceptable discordance in their sense of identity as a transgender person living in an acquired gender. We also agree with the Scottish Ministers that the GRA 2004 is concerned with relationships between private parties as well as between the transgender person and the state. </p>

The &#8220;necessary implication&#8221; test was discussed by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co Ltd) v Special Commissioner of Income Tax</span> [2002] UKHL 21,&#160;[2003] 1 AC 563. That case concerned the abrogation of an important common law right, namely the right to rely on legal professional privilege to resist a request for disclosure of documents. At para 45 of his speech, Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough said that where the statute did not contain any express words that abrogated that right, the question arose whether there was a necessary implication to that effect. He described&#160;the test to be applied in those circumstances as distinguishing between what it would have been sensible or reasonable for Parliament to have included or what Parliament would, if it had thought about it, probably have included and what it is clear that the express language of the statute shows that the statute must have included: &#8220;A necessary implication is a matter of express language and logic not interpretation&#8221;: para 45.</p>

The principal issue before the Court of Appeal was whether section 12 of the GRA 2004 which provides that a change of gender &#8220;does not affect the status of the person as the father or mother of a child&#8221; only precluded recharacterising someone&#8217;s status as regards children born before the issue of the GRC or whether it also determined the parent&#8217;s status if the baby was born after the issue of that certificate.

In his judgment at first instance ([2019] EWHC 2384 (Fam), [2020] Fam 45), the President noted that the fertility treatment provided by the clinic to Mr McConnell could only lawfully be provided if it comprised &#8220;treatment services&#8221; capable of being licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 (&#8220;HFEA&#8221;). &#8220;Treatment services&#8221; were defined in section 2 of the HFEA as services provided &#8220;for the purpose of assisting women to carry children&#8221;.

The treatment might be wholly outside the regulatory scheme with the possible result not only that the treatment was unlawful, but that the donor of the sperm became the legal father of the child.

Such a comparator (actual or hypothetical) must be a person who does not share B&#8217;s protected characteristic. Section 23(1) makes clear that, apart from the protected characteristic, there must be &#8220;no material difference between the circumstances relating to each case&#8221; when determining whether B has been treated less favourably. Accordingly, where sex is the protected characteristic, a woman relying on section 13(1) must compare her treatment with the treatment that was or would have been afforded to a man whose circumstances are not materially different to hers; in other words, a similarly situated man. <span style="font-family:Times">Where </span><span style="font-family:Times;color:#000000">gender reassignment is the protected characteristic, in the case of a male person proposing to or undergoing gender reassignment to the opposite sex, the correct comparator is likely to be a man without the protected characteristic of gender reassignment and similarly for a woman (although there may be situations where the comparator&#8217;s sex is immaterial to the comparison).

Section 13(1) by contrast is framed by reference to less favourable treatment &#8220;because of a protected characteristic&#8221;.

They are always group orientated. The claim that one is a woman is a claim to be included within a particular category of persons and to be excluded from another. It is also a claim to include some persons and to exclude other persons within the group that one is a part of. This matters especially for aspects of the Equality Act 2010 which require duty-bearers to be cognisant of how their conduct might affect those who share a protected characteristic or where there is an obligation to account for the distinct needs and interests of those who share a particular characteristic.&#8221; </p>

Indirect discrimination is defined by sections 19 and/or 19A of the EA 2010. Section 19(1) and (2) provide that indirect discrimination occurs when a person (A) applies to another (B) a &#8220;provision, criterion or practice&#8221; (generally referred to as a &#8220;PCP&#8221;) if:</p>

For example, an employer, who sets a minimum height requirement for employment in a police service at a level that (for physiological reasons) most men, but fewer women can comply with, can reasonably expect that women as a group will be disadvantaged by such a requirement. Unless the employer can justify the minimum height requirement, it will be unlawful as indirectly sex discriminatory. The same would be true of an employer&#8217;s requirement to fulfil the full range of shift patterns as a tube train driver arranged on a 24 hour per day, seven days per week basis, because it is recognised that those with primary child-care responsibilities (for societal reasons, mostly women) will find it harder to comply with such a requirement than those without (mostly men). In both cases, the employer can reasonably be expected to anticipate these consequences for women as a group in the workforce and can therefore be expected to justify the PCP before imposing it.</p>

In broad terms, these provisions enable a person (P) who reasonably thinks that persons who share a protected characteristic either suffer a disadvantage connected to the characteristic, or have needs that are different from the needs of persons who do not share it, or their participation in an activity is disproportionately low, to take proportionate positive action with the aim of enabling or encouraging that group (comprising persons who share the protected characteristic) to overcome or minimise the disadvantage, meet those needs or participate in the activity.</p>

These shared experiences or needs can and do give rise to particular disadvantage if they are not met, and they differentiate that group from other groups without the protected characteristic. As we have said, the duties imposed by the EA 2010 require an ability to anticipate that particular rules, policies or practices might affect those who share a protected characteristic and have distinct needs or interests in consequence. Those upon whom the EA 2010 imposes duties (the duty-bearers) must regulate their conduct and practices to avoid unlawful indirect discrimination. Organisations considering taking appropriate positive action measures must be able to identify membership of a disadvantaged group sharing a particular characteristic. Public authorities subject to the duty in section 149 (the PSED) must be able to identify differently affected groups if they are to be able to analyse the features which may disadvantage some groups over others or affect relations between them, in order to analyse the impact of their policies.</p>

This is because the purpose of the amendment (introduced by the 2021 Act) was to ensure that section 9(2) of the 2014 Act read as follows: &#8220;Before a medical examination of the person is carried out by a registered medical practitioner, the person must be given an opportunity to request that any such medical examination be carried out by a registered medical practitioner of a sex specified by the person&#8221;. We agree with her analysis: sex as used in this provision must mean biological sex notwithstanding that there is no reference to biological sex in this provision. The clear statutory intention is to respect the right of a female or male victim of a sexual crime to request same sex care should she or he so wish because it has always been, and still is, well recognised that reasonable objection can be taken to an intimate medical examination by a member of the opposite biological sex.

We will then consider the practicability and workability of the duties imposed and protections afforded by the EA 2010 if a &#8220;certificated sex&#8221; interpretation is adopted (see paras 210 to 246 below).

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The definition of sex in the EA 2010 makes clear that the concept of sex is binary, a person is either a woman or a man. Persons who share that protected characteristic for the purposes of the group-based rights and protections are persons of the same sex and provisions that refer to protection for women necessarily exclude men. Although the word &#8220;biological&#8221; does not appear in this definition, the ordinary meaning of those plain and unambiguous words corresponds with the biological characteristics that make an individual a man or a woman. These are assumed to be self-explanatory and to require no further explanation. Men and women are on the face of the definition only differentiated as a grouping by the biology they share with their group. </p>

References to a &#8220;woman&#8221; and &#8220;women&#8221; as a group sharing the protected characteristic of sex would include all females of any age (irrespective of any other protected characteristic) and those trans women (biological men) who have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment and a GRC (and who are therefore female as a matter of law). The same references would necessarily exclude men of any age, but they would also exclude some (biological) women living in the male gender with a GRC (trans men who are legally male). The converse position would apply to references to &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;men&#8221; as a group sharing the same protected characteristic. We can identify no good reason why the legislature should have intended that sex-based rights and protections under the EA 2010 should apply to these complex, heterogenous groupings, rather than to the distinct group of (biological) women and girls (or men and boys) with their shared biology leading to shared disadvantage and discrimination faced by them as a distinct group.</p>

They state that uncertainty and ambiguity about the circumstances in which it is legitimate to treat (biological) women and girls as a distinct group whose interests need to be considered and protected, have the effect that many organisations now feel inhibited in doing so. </p>

Mr O&#8217;Neill relied on the contrast between the definition in section 212(1) of the EA 2010 which says, &#8220;In this Act &#8230; &#8216;woman&#8217; means a female of any age&#8221; and the previous provisions in sections 5(2) and 82 of the SDA 1975 which said &#8220;&#8216;woman&#8217; includes a female of any age&#8221;. We do not consider this change to be significant in context. In both cases, the meaning conveyed is simply to make clear that boys and girls are also included within the definition of man and woman respectively. We do not see the words &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">includes</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">means</span>&#8221; as sufficiently distinctive to lead to any conclusions about whether the EA 2010 was intended to alter or maintain the position under the SDA 1975 that the terms refer to biological sex only.</p>

The concept of sex is of foundational importance in the EA 2010. The words sex and woman appear across different parts of the Act and in many sections. It would be surprising if the words sex and woman were intended to have different meanings in different sections or parts of the EA 2010, as the Inner House concluded, especially given the definitions of &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;woman&#8221; in section 212(1) of the EA 2010. Indeed, it would offend against the principle of legal certainty and the need for a meaning which is constant and predictable, especially in the context of an Act with the purposes we have identified, and which has such practical everyday consequences for so many individuals and organisations in society.</p>

This presumption can be rebutted where the context requires, even where a saving for context does not appear in the definition section. But this is likely to be rare and giving a variable meaning to a defined term is generally only done where it is clear that there is a genuine drafting error resulting in differential usage of the word or term in the text of the legislation: see for example the observations to this effect in a human rights context in <span style="font-style:italic">Secretary of State for Work and Pensions v M</span> [2004] EWCA Civ 1343, [2006] QB 380 at para 84. </p>

The protection afforded by these provisions is predicated on the fact of pregnancy or the fact of having given birth to a child and the taking of leave in consequence.

The references to &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;woman&#8221; in paragraph 18(1A)(a) and (b) can only be interpreted by their biological meaning for obvious reasons. The reference to a person in (c) is otherwise rendered meaningless, and the provision is unworkable. Secondly, the draftsperson was fully cognisant of the GRA 2004 and plainly understood its unequivocal consequences in the case of marriage where a GRC has been issued. Where the legislation extends to a person to whom a full GRC has been issued, this is done by express provision referring to a &#8220;relevant gender change case&#8221; and not by the implicit adoption of a legally constructed concept of sex as certificated sex. Thirdly, the Scottish Ministers and the EHRC submit that this provision would be unnecessary if &#8220;sex&#8221; in the EA 2010 meant biological sex only, as the couple concerned would not in fact be married to a &#8220;person of the same sex in a relevant gender change case&#8221;; they would still be married to a person of the opposite sex. We do not accept this contention. The GRA 2004 unequivocally applies to the law relating to marriage. This is a consequence of the GRA 2004 itself and not a consequence of interpreting sex in the EA 2010 in any particular way. </p>

In the case of sex discrimination, it is impossible to see how an assessment of the differential risk known to be posed by, say, women and men drivers, could possibly be made by reference to actuarial or other reliable data sources that had also to take account of certificated sex based on a GRC.

Secondly, they say that without requiring a different meaning to be given to the term &#8220;woman&#8221; in the pregnancy provisions, a person such as the claimant in <span style="font-style:italic">McConnell</span> (discussed at paras 105&#8211;107 above), namely, a pregnant trans man with a GRC who is for legal purposes a &#8220;pregnant man&#8221;, but a biological woman, would be entitled to protection from discrimination under section 13(1) of the EA 2010 on grounds of gender reassignment &#8211; &#8220;on the basis that, in so far as the protections afforded to &#8216;women&#8217; in respect of birth and maternity fall within the regulated activities, he would, in being treated less favourably by being denied those protections, have been directly discriminated against on that ground&#8221;.</p>

The definition of sex is foundational to the EA 2010. The bare assertion that a variable definition is &#8220;not impermissible as a matter of statutory construction&#8221; falls far short of providing any compelling basis for concluding that a variable definition was intended in section 212(1) or is required. It is simply not plausible to think that the definition of &#8220;sex&#8221; as used in the pregnancy and maternity-related provisions is the result of a genuine drafting error. There are no circumstances in which a biological male can become pregnant, and no man can therefore ever be an appropriate comparator in a pregnancy discrimination case. As we have explained, the pregnancy discrimination provisions are deliberately framed on the basis of unfavourable rather than less favourable treatment and tied to biological females for this reason. Given the presumption (which has not been rebutted) that section 212(1) provides a single definition of &#8220;woman&#8221; for the purposes of the EA 2010, it follows that &#8220;woman&#8221; wherever used in the EA 2010 must have a single, consistent, stable and predictable meaning. </p>

It is difficult to see any good reason for such an approach. The Scottish Ministers&#8217; second argument about gender reassignment discrimination seeks to address the oddity of this result but is unsatisfactory as a response: on their case a man denied the protections available to women for pregnancy and maternity is most obviously treated differently on grounds of sex and not gender reassignment, but sex discrimination cannot run. Parliament plainly intended biological women to benefit automatically from these protections and it is unlikely to have been the legislative intention that a pregnant trans man with a GRC (legally male but biologically female) should have to pursue gender reassignment discrimination in order to obtain the benefit of such protection, whereas a pregnant trans man without a GRC (legally and biologically female) is automatically entitled to them as a woman.</p>

Those who have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment are referred to as &#8220;a transsexual person&#8221; (section 7(3)(a)), not as a &#8220;trans&#8221; woman or man. There is no distinction drawn in section 7 or elsewhere between those for whom the relevant process would involve reassignment male to female or female to male. In other words, it is the attribute of proposing to undergo, undergoing or having undergone a process (or part of a process) for the purpose of reassignment, which is the common factor, not the sex into which the person is reassigned.</p>

Instead, it is dependent on a process for the &#8220;purpose of reassigning the person&#8217;s sex by changing physiological or other attributes of sex&#8221;. But the fact that section 7 refers to a process for reassigning sex does not lead to the conclusion that such a process results in a change in the protected characteristic of sex under the EA 2010. Section 7 does not say this; nor is it said elsewhere in the EA 2010. The Scottish Ministers contend that it is inherent in this provision because it contemplates the possibility of a change in the protected characteristic of sex from &#8220;man&#8221; to &#8220;woman&#8221; and vice versa for persons who have obtained a full GRC. Again, section 7 does not say so. There is nothing in its wording to suggest that the change referred to is based on obtaining a paper certificate. The critical process on which the section 7 characteristic depends involves a change in physiological or other attributes of what must necessarily be biological sex; but there is nothing to suggest that undergoing such a process changes a person&#8217;s sex as a matter of law. It does not. Indeed, a full process of medical transition to the opposite gender without obtaining a GRC has no effect on the person&#8217;s sex as a matter of law. </p>

Without a GRC a trans woman protected by section 7 of the EA 2010 is male for legal purposes and so too a trans man is female for legal purposes. It is significant therefore, that section 7 is considerably broader in scope and coverage than the category of people with a GRC.

The only difference between these two groups is possession of a paper certificate and that fact (possessing a GRC) is confidential to the person who has it and subject to stringent restrictions on disclosure (see section 22 of the GRA 2004). The duty-bearer cannot ask whether it has been obtained. There is, accordingly, no way for duty-bearers to distinguish confidently between these two groups when regulating their conduct in accordance with obligations imposed by the EA 2010. Moreover, in either case, the individual&#8217;s biological sex may continue to be readily perceivable and may form the basis of unlawful discrimination. A person has the protected characteristic of gender reassignment as soon as they propose to undergo the process so it may be that at that stage there is no change in outward appearance.</p>

We can see no good reason why the legislature should have intended that people with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment should be regarded and treated differently under the EA 2010 depending on whether or not they possess a (confidential) certificate, even though in many (if not most) cases there will be no material distinction in their personal characteristics, either as regards gender identity, or appearance, or as to how they are perceived or treated by others or society at large. The difficulty this interpretation would create for service-providers, employers and other organisations in applying equality law to these groups is obvious. Research referred to by Sex Matters shows that, since it is in practice impossible for organisations to distinguish between people with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment who do and do not have a GRC, many organisations feel pressured into accepting de facto self-identification for the purposes of identifying whom to treat as a woman or girl when seeking to apply the group-based rights and protections of the EA 2010 in relation to the protected characteristic of sex. The result in some cases is that certain women-only groups, organisations, and charities have come under pressure (including from funders and commissioners) to include trans women and policy decisions have been taken simply to accept members or users of the opposite biological sex, either assuming that they hold a confidential GRC or on the basis of self-identification.</p>

On the other hand, if a GRC under section 9(1) of the GRA 2004 were to alter the meaning of sex under the EA 2010, it would mean that a trans woman (a biological male) with a GRC (so legally female) who remains sexually oriented to other females would become a same sex attracted female, in other words, a lesbian. The concept of sexual orientation towards members of a particular sex in section 12 is rendered meaningless. It would also affect the composition of the groups who share the same sexual orientation (because a trans woman with a GRC and a sexual orientation towards women would fall to be treated as a lesbian) in a similar way as described above in relation to women and girls. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, as well as the inevitable loss of autonomy and dignity for lesbians such an approach would carry with it, it would also have practical implications for lesbians across several areas of their lives (as described by Ms Monaghan KC in her written case for the second interveners). Of particular significance is the impact it would have for lesbian clubs and associations governed by Part 7 of the EA 2010, including relatively small associations (they must have at least 25 members and admission must be regulated by the association&#8217;s rules and involve a process of selection). Part 7 of the EA 2010 prohibits discrimination, harassment and victimisation against applicants for membership, members and their guests, of clubs and associations: sections 101 and 102 of the EA 2010. However, Schedule 16 paragraph 1 allows an association to restrict membership, access to benefits, services and facilities, and access to guests to &#8220;persons who share a protected characteristic&#8221;. In other words, clubs and associations can restrict membership and access to women or to same sex attracted people without contravening sections 101 and 102 of the EA 2010. But there is no exception permitting the exclusion of trans women (biological men) with a GRC (so legally female). Accordingly, if a GRC changes a person&#8217;s sex for the purposes of the EA 2010, a women-only club or a club reserved for lesbians would have to admit trans women with a GRC (legal females who are biologically male and attracted to women). Evidence referred to by the second interveners suggests that this is having a chilling effect on lesbians who are no longer using lesbian-only spaces because of the presence of trans women (ie biological men who live in the female gender).</p>

It is also impractical. The Scottish Ministers also suggested in writing that the fact that the members of the association may not be attracted to a particular woman (a trans woman with a GRC who is therefore legally female) or wish to associate with her, does not diminish the protections which they are entitled to in terms of their own protected characteristic of sexual orientation. Even if this is true (which is doubtful) it does not begin to address the chilling effect a certificated sex interpretation appears to have on the ability of lesbians to associate in lesbian-only spaces. The idea that to do so they should seek instead to restrict membership on the basis of &#8220;some shared philosophical belief regarding the immutability of sex&#8221; (as Ms Crawford KC suggested in argument) demonstrates the incoherence of the Scottish Ministers&#8217; position.</p>

The definition of these terms contained in section 212(1), when applied in particular to section 11 (the protected characteristic of sex which is at the heart of this case) is not capable of being interpreted on the basis of certificated sex. Rather, sex has its biological meaning throughout this legislation: &#8220;woman&#8221; always and only means a biological female of any age in section 212(1). It follows that a biological male of any age cannot fall within this definition; and &#8220;woman&#8221; does not mean or sometimes mean or include a male of any age who holds a GRC or exclude a female of any age who holds a GRC. To reach any other conclusion would turn the foundational definition of sex on its head and diminish the protection available to individuals and groups against discrimination on the grounds of sex. As we shall explain below, in relation to sex discrimination, an individual will still be entitled to protection against discrimination on the grounds of sex on its biological meaning. Thus, the objective of non-discrimination between the sexes is maintained, while at the same time protecting individuals with a GRC from non-discrimination and without seriously undermining the intention behind the GRA 2004. </p>

Schedule 3 contains exemptions from this general prohibition. As we shall explain, some of these permit what would otherwise constitute gender reassignment discrimination but make no similar provision for persons issued with a full GRC. Other provisions permit carve-outs from what would otherwise constitute sex discrimination under the EA 2010. In enacting these exemptions, the intention must have been to allow for the exclusion of those with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, regardless of the possession of a GRC, in order to maintain the provision of single or separate services for women and men as distinct groups in appropriate circumstances. These provisions are directed at maintaining the availability of separate or single spaces or services for women (or men) as a group &#8211; for example changing rooms, homeless hostels, segregated swimming areas (that might be essential for religious reasons or desirable for the protection of a woman&#8217;s safety, or the autonomy or privacy and dignity of the two sexes) or medical or counselling services provided only to women (or men) &#8211; for example cervical cancer screening for women or prostate cancer screening for men, or counselling for women only as victims of rape or domestic violence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">If sex has its biological meaning in this paragraph, then a service-provider can separate male and female users as obvious and distinct groups. For example, a homeless shelter could have separate hostels for men and women provided this pursued a legitimate aim, which might be the safety and security of women users or their privacy and dignity (and the same for male users). By contrast, if sex means certificated sex, the service- provider would have to allow access to trans women with a GRC (in other words, biological males who are female according to section 9(1)) to the women&#8217;s hostel. The following practical difficulties would arise. First, it would be difficult or impossible for the service-provider to distinguish between trans women with and without a GRC because, as we have explained, the two groups are often visually or outwardly indistinguishable. Secondly and more fundamentally, it is likely to be difficult (if not impossible) to establish the conditions necessary for separate services for each sex when each group includes persons of both biological sexes. For example, it is difficult to envisage how the condition in paragraph 26(2)(a) (a joint service for persons of both sexes would be less effective) could ever be fulfilled when each sex includes members of the opposite biological sex in possession of a GRC and excludes members of the same biological sex with a GRC. In other words, if as a matter of law, a service-provider is required to provide services previously limited to women also to trans women with a GRC even if they present as biological men, it is difficult to see how they can then justify refusing to provide those services also to biological men and who also look like biological men.</p>

For example, take a cervical cancer screening service. On a certificated sex interpretation, a trans man who has a GRC (so is legally male) but (as a biological female) retains a uterus and cervix, has the same need of the cervical cancer screening service that is otherwise reserved for women only. A trans woman with a GRC (so, legally female) would have no such need of that service (as a biological male).

Again, it is difficult to imagine how or in what circumstances it might be considered reasonable for a woman to object to members of the opposite sex (in condition (6)) where &#8220;the opposite sex&#8221; would include trans women without a GRC (who remain legally male) but not to &#8220;members of her own sex&#8221;. This would arise if by operation of section 9(1) of the GRA 2004 the group of &#8220;members of her own sex&#8221; were to include biological men with a GRC, and so legally female who may be physically and outwardly indistinguishable from the former group of trans women without a GRC. While many women in a female-only changing room or on a women-only hospital ward or in a rape counselling group might reasonably object to the presence of biological males, it is difficult to see how the reasonableness of such an objection could be founded on possession or lack of a certificate. This is so especially when the distinction does not track physical appearance or presentation, and the woman is unlikely to have any information about the GRC at the point at which her objection might be raised. A trans woman with a GRC who presents fully as a woman may feel she is more likely to prompt objections from other users if she enters the men&#8217;s changing room or other facilities than if she uses the women&#8217;s changing room or facilities. But in facing that dilemma she is in the same position as a trans woman without a GRC. Although such trans women may in practice choose to use female-only facilities in a way which does not in fact compromise the privacy and dignity of the other women users, the Scottish Ministers do not suggest that a trans woman without a GRC is legally entitled to do so. </p>

It can only be met where there is likely to be physical contact between person A, to whom a service is provided, and another person B, and B might reasonably object if A were not of the same sex as B. For example, it is readily understandable that a female massage therapist offering massages in her clients&#8217; homes might reasonably object to providing this service to a man in that environment, but for the reasons explained above, hard to see how any reasonable objection to providing the service could depend on whether the trans person (person A) has or does not have a GRC. The objection that B might reasonably have can only fairly be interpreted as being to the biological sex of the other person. It is fanciful (even perverse) to think that any reasonable objection to the presence of a person of the opposite sex could be grounded in GRC status or that a confidential GRC could make any difference at all. Read fairly and in context, the provisions relating to single-sex services can only be interpreted by reference to biological sex.</p>

(The example given in the explanatory notes at para 740 also does not distinguish between transexual people with a GRC and those without: &#8220;A group counselling session is provided for female victims of sexual assault. The organisers do not allow transsexual people to attend as they judge that the clients who attend the group session are unlikely to do so if a male-to-female transsexual person was also there. This would be lawful&#8221;). We can see nothing to support the Inner House&#8217;s conclusion that &#8220;the importance of this paragraph is that it provides the only basis upon which a person might be permitted to exclude a person with a GRC from services which are provided for their acquired sex&#8221;. Nor is the EHRC correct to assert that paragraph 28 is redundant on a biological interpretation of sex. On the contrary, if sex means biological sex, then provided it is proportionate, the female only nature of the service would engage paragraph 27 and would permit the exclusion of all males including males living in the female gender regardless of GRC status. Moreover, women living in the male gender could also be excluded under paragraph 28 without this amounting to gender reassignment discrimination. This might be considered proportionate where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example, because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance or attributes to which reasonable objection might be taken in the context of the women-only service being provided. Their exclusion would amount to unlawful gender reassignment discrimination not sex discrimination absent this exception. </p>

The Inner House however, held at para 59 that &#8220;sex&#8221; in this context is defined as including birth sex for those still living in that sex, and &#8220;acquired sex&#8221; for those in possession of a GRC in the opposite gender. In our judgment, this would undermine the very considerations of privacy and decency between the sexes both in the availability of communal sleeping accommodation and in the use of sanitary facilities which the legislation plainly intended to provide for. If sex has a certificated sex meaning it is difficult to envisage any circumstances in which this gateway could sensibly be met since there would be no rational basis for saying that &#8220;for reasons of privacy&#8221; any communal accommodation and sanitary facilities should be used by women and trans women with a GRC (so legally female but biologically male) only, but not by trans women without a GRC who may be indistinguishable from those in possession of a GRC (and vice versa). This interpretation would run contrary to the plain intention of these provisions. </p>

In both cases the exemption cannot apply unless there is a gender-affected activity. This is a gateway condition.</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">A gender-affected activity is a defined term. It depends on a determination of whether the physical strength, stamina or physique of average persons of one sex would put them at a disadvantage as competitors in a particular sport when compared to average persons of the other sex. Take boxing as an example. This is undoubtedly a gender-affected activity on a biological interpretation of sex in section 195(3). On this basis, it is readily apparent (indeed, obvious) that women&#8217;s average physical strength, stamina and/or physique will disadvantage them as competitors against average men in a boxing match. However, if average women as a group for comparison with average men for the purposes of section 195(1) includes trans women with GRCs (so legally female but biologically male) the differences in strength, stamina and physique between the two groups may begin to fade. Although at present the numbers of trans people with GRCs may be statistically insignificant, that could not have been predicted at the time the GRA 2004 was enacted, and the effect of section 9(1) cannot depend on how many people are issued with GRCs. Each group has members of the opposite biological sex in it and the gateway condition may be difficult to establish at all. Even if the gateway condition is established, the approach to the group of trans sportswomen who are potentially to be excluded would differ on a rationally unconnected basis: whether or not they have a paper certificate. To exclude trans women with a GRC from the boxing competition, the organiser would have the additional burden of showing that it was necessary to do so in the interests of fairness or safety, whereas a trans woman without a GRC could simply be excluded as a male under section 195(1).</p>

This would be covered by the sex discrimination exception in section 195(1). But if, in addition, the providers of the boxing competition were concerned that fair competition or safety necessitates the exclusion of trans men (biological females living in the male gender, irrespective of GRC status) who have taken testosterone to give them more masculine attributes, their exclusion would amount to gender reassignment discrimination, not sex discrimination, but would be permitted by section 195(2). It is here that the gender reassignment exception would be available to ensure that the exclusion is not unlawful, whether as direct or indirect gender reassignment discrimination.</p>

This is a confusing group to envisage because it cuts across and fragments both biological sex and gender reassignment into heterogenous groupings which may have little in common. Any data collection exercise will be distorted by the heterogenous nature of such a group. Moreover, the distinct discrimination and disadvantage faced by women as a group (or trans people) would simply not be capable of being addressed by the PSED because the group being considered would not be a group that, because of the shared protected characteristic of sex, has experienced discrimination or disadvantage flowing from shared biology, societal norms or prejudice. Whereas the interests of biological women (or men) can be rationally considered and addressed, and likewise, the interests of trans people (who are vulnerable and often disadvantaged for different reasons), we do not understand how the interests of this heterogenous group can begin to be considered and addressed.</p>

If the purpose of the positive action measure is to increase representation on public boards of women (with their shared experience of disadvantage based on sex and overcoming such disadvantage), a certificated sex approach changes the group to be represented.

Indeed, a certificated sex reading of sex suggests that the needs and interests of transsexuals without a GRC are different from those with a GRC, though their circumstances may often be indistinguishable.

This misses the point. The group-based rights and duties are concerned with identifying the shared needs and disadvantages that affect women as a group, or trans people as a group. If the first group were to include men and the second group people who are not trans people, it is unlikely that they would have the same needs or share the same disadvantages that would justify their inclusion in the particular group. Equally, the fact that some members of the group do not wish to benefit from a particular measure designed to reduce, say under-representation of that group, does not mean that they do not share the same needs and disadvantages as the group in question. </p>

In its letter of 3 April 2023, the EHRC advised the UK Government about the consequences for the broader functioning of the EA 2010 if the decision of the Lord Ordinary in <span style="font-style:italic">For Women Scotland v Scottish Ministers (No 2)</span> was upheld (as it was in large part, by the Inner House). It is not for the EHRC to determine the meaning of sex in the EA 2010. That is for the courts to do. However, we consider it significant that many of the problems we have identified as leading to incoherence and absurdity in the practical operation of the EA 2010 if a certificated sex interpretation is adopted, are expressly recognised by the EHRC as grounds for urgent consideration of legislative amendment. The letter explains the EHRC&#8217;s understanding that sex in the EA 2010 has a certificated sex meaning pursuant to sections 9(1) and (2) of the GRA 2004 and continues that &#8220;it has not been straightforward for service-providers and employers to apply the law, including in areas such as sport and health services&#8221;. The EHRC concludes &#8220;that if &#8216;sex&#8217; is defined as biological sex for the purposes of EA 2010, this would bring greater legal clarity in eight areas&#8221;. The eight areas are then discussed as follows (numbering added):</p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is now well-established that direct discrimination because of a protected characteristic (section 13 of the EA 2010) encompasses not only cases where the complainant affected by discrimination has the protected characteristic in question, but also where the discriminator perceives that the complainant has the characteristic, or in some other way associates the complainant with the protected characteristic. This can occur, for example, where the complainant is discriminated against because of caring responsibilities for a person with a protected characteristic, such as disability (as happened in <span style="font-style:italic">Coleman v Attridge Law </span>[2008] ICR 1128; <span style="font-style:italic">EBR Attridge LLP v Coleman</span> [2010] ICR 242) or where the complainant is treated detrimentally because it is thought that she or he has a particular protected characteristic even if they do not (<span style="font-style:italic">English v Thomas Sanderson Blinds Ltd</span> [2009] ICR 543, paras 37 to 40 per Sedley LJ, where the protected characteristic was sexual orientation). What is required is that the protected characteristic is a ground for the treatment in question. Terms such as &#8220;associative discrimination&#8221; and &#8220;discrimination by perception&#8221; are not a critical part of the analysis. What matters in the former <span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;color:#000000">is</span> whether the treatment of the complainant was done because of the protected characteristic of the other person. In a case of perceived discrimination, the correct comparator is someone who is not perceived to have that protected characteristic: <span style="font-style:italic">Chief Constable of Norfolk Constabulary v Coffey</span> [2020] ICR 145. In <span style="font-style:italic">Coffey</span> the EAT (Judge David Richardson) held that where a claimant is treated less favourably on the basis of a mistaken perception that she was disabled, the correct hypothetical comparator was a person who was not perceived to be disabled and who had the same abilities as the claimant. On appeal, Underhill LJ (who gave a judgment with which the other members agreed) upheld the decision and expressly endorsed this comparator (see para 68 referring to para 66 of the EAT judgment [2018] ICR 812<span style="font-weight:bold">.</span> (The perception-based approach was approved by Lord Mance JSC in <span style="font-style:italic">R (E) v Governing Body of JFS </span>[2009] UKSC 15, [2010] 2 AC 728 at para 85.)</p>

There is no need for her to declare her true biological sex. There is nothing disadvantageous about this approach. Neither a biological woman nor a trans woman &#8220;bring a claim of direct sex discrimination <span style="font-style:italic">as a woman</span>&#8221; (as the EHRC suggests).

A man who identifies as a woman who is treated less favourably because of the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, will be able to claim on that basis. A man who identifies as a woman who is treated less favourably not because of being trans (the protected characteristic of gender reassignment), but because of being perceived as being a woman, will be able to claim for direct sex discrimination on that basis. This does not entail any practical disadvantage and there is no discordance (as the Scottish Ministers appear to suggest) between the individual&#8217;s position in society and the ability to claim on this basis. A certificated sex reading of the EA 2010 is not necessary here, and the approach applies equally whether or not the claimant has a GRC.</p>

It is well-established that where a policy or rule is applied which applies a criterion that is indissociable from sex in order to determine entitlement to some benefit, that will necessarily constitute unlawful direct discrimination that cannot be justified. A clear example is the policy adopted by the council in <span style="font-style:italic">James v Eastleigh Borough Council</span> [1990] 2 AC 751 (see p764A per Lord Bridge) regarding free admission to the swimming pool for those of pension age at a time when pension ages for men and women were different. For this principle to apply, there must be an &#8220;exact correspondence&#8221; between the protected characteristic and the criterion in question (see <span style="font-style:italic">Preddy v Bull </span>[2013] UKSC 73, [2013] 1 WLR 3741 at para 21 per Lady Hale DPSC). A certificated sex reading of sex in the EA 2010 would have the effect of preventing that principle from applying in relation to a criterion which is indissociable from biological sex (for example, a sex-based biological characteristic) because that criterion would not be indissociable from the more complex grouping that would then constitute members of the relevant &#8220;sex&#8221; as modified by section 9(1). Instead, the application of such a criterion would fall to be considered as a case of indirect discrimination, with the potential for a justification defence. A certificated sex reading of sex would therefore remove this important aspect of protection in relation to direct discrimination under section 13. It is difficult to see why the GRA 2004 could have intended to remove such protection.</p>

Again, this does not entail any practical disadvantage or involve any discordance between the claim and the individual&#8217;s position in society. On the contrary, the claim will be founded on the facts of a particular shared disadvantage.

This is true. But the position would simply reverse if either the trans man or trans woman did not have a GRC: in other words, a trans man with a GRC (legally male but biologically female) cannot rely on a male comparator to bring an equal pay claim but can do so if he does not have a GRC (and vice versa). That is an odd divergence and is unlikely to have been intended by Parliament. It is also true that a biological definition of sex would transfer this right from some trans women to some trans men.

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">For all these reasons, this examination of the language of the EA 2010, its context and purpose, demonstrate that the words &#8220;sex&#8221;, &#8220;woman&#8221; and &#8220;man&#8221; in sections 11 and 212(1) mean (and were always intended to mean) biological sex, biological woman and biological man. These and the other provisions to which we have referred cannot properly be interpreted as also extending to include certificated sex without rendering them incoherent and unworkable. In other words, in relation to sex discrimination (for the purposes of sections 11 and 212(1)), a person with the protected characteristic of sex has the characteristic of their biological sex only: a trans man with a GRC (a biological female but legally male for those purposes to which section 9(1) of the GRA 2004 applies) is a woman for the purposes of section 11 and a trans woman with a GRC (biologically male but legally female for those purposes to which section 9(1) applies), is a man and not entitled to be treated as a woman under the EA 2010. This conclusion does not remove or diminish the important protections available under the EA 2010 for trans people with a GRC as we have explained. To the contrary, this potentially vulnerable group remains protected in the ways we have described. In these circumstances, and notwithstanding that there is no express provision in the EA 2010 addressing the effect which section 9(1) of the GRA 2004 has on the definition of &#8220;sex&#8221;, we are satisfied that the EA 2010 does make provision within the meaning of section 9(3) that disapplies the rule in section 9(1) of the GRA 2004.</p>

It would create heterogeneous groupings. As a matter of ordinary language, the provisions relating to sex discrimination, and especially those relating to pregnancy and maternity (sections 13(6), 17 and 18), and to protection from risks specifically affecting women (Schedule 22, paragraph 2), can only be interpreted as referring to biological sex (paras 172, 177-188).</p>

The interpretation favoured by the EHRC and the Scottish Ministers would create two sub-groups within those who share the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, giving trans persons who possess a GRC greater rights than those who do not. Those seeking to perform their obligations under the Act would have no obvious means of distinguishing between the two sub-groups to whom different duties were owed, particularly since they could not ask persons whether they had obtained a GRC (paras 198-203).</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel2" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.62in">It is striking that the EHRC has advised the UK Government of the problems created by its interpretation of the EA 2010, which include many of the matters which we have discussed above, and has called for legislation to amend the Act. The absence of coherence and the practical problems to which that interpretation gives rise are clear pointers that the interpretation is not correct (para 247).</p>

In the light of case law interpreting the relevant provisions, they would be able to invoke the provisions on direct discrimination and harassment, and indirect discrimination. A certificated sex reading is not required to give them those protections (paras 248-263).</p>

The meaning of the terms &#8220;sex&#8221;, &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;woman&#8221; in the EA 2010 is biological and not certificated sex.

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">For all these reasons, we conclude that the Guidance issued by the Scottish Government is incorrect. A person with a GRC in the female gender does not come within the definition of &#8220;woman&#8221; for the purposes of sex discrimination in section 11 of the EA 2010. That in turn means that the definition of &#8220;woman&#8221; in section 2 of the 2018 Act, which Scottish Ministers accept must bear the same meaning as the term &#8220;woman&#8221; in section 11 and section 212 of the EA 2010, is limited to biological women and does not include trans women with a GRC. Because it is so limited, the 2018 Act does not stray beyond the exception permitted in section L2 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act into reserved matters. Therefore, construed in the way that we have held it is to be construed, the 2018 Act is within the competence of the Scottish Parliament and can operate to encourage the participation of women in senior positions in public life. </p>

	    <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">There may well be public boards on which it is also important for trans people of either or both genders to be represented in order to ensure that their perspective is brought to bear in the board&#8217;s deliberations and in the organisation&#8217;s governance. Nothing in this judgment is intended to discourage the appointment of trans people to public boards or to minimise the importance of addressing their under-representation on such boards. The issue here is only whether the appointment of a trans woman who has a GRC counts as the appointment of a woman and so counts towards achieving the goal set in the gender representation objective, namely that the board has 50% of non-executive members who are women. In our judgment it does not. </p>
