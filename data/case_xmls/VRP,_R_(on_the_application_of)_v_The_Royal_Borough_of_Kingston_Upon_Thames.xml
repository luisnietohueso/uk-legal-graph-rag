	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant is a 19-year-old woman with severe physical, learning and Autistic disabilities. In consequence, she needs full-time one-to-one care. From November 2022, she was referred to the Defendant&#8217;s Adult Social Care services. At present, the Defendant makes direct payments to her parents who use these to arrange provision of her care needs. However, they anticipate that there will come a time when they are not able to do this, and the Claimant will fall under the direct care of the Defendant. Her parents express concern that the Defendant does not operate a system for the provision of adult social care that ensures, or has the object of ensuring, same-sex personal and intimate care for women service users. Allied to this, they believe that the Defendant should record the sex (as well as the gender) of service users, when carrying out its functions under the Care Act 2014.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Reflecting the approach taken by the parties in articulating their respective cases, references to &#8220;sex&#8221; in this judgment are to biological sex, rather than to gender, which I refer to specifically where it is material to do so.</p>

	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Section 3 of the Claim Form recorded that the challenges were to: (1) the Defendant&#8217;s policy &#8220;of not recording the sex of services users when carrying out assessments for social care under the Care Act 2014 and/or its refusal to record the Claimant&#8217;s sex in her care plan or other data&#8221;; (2) the Defendant&#8217;s policy of recording the gender of service users as a mandatory category when carrying out assessments for social care under the Care Act 2014; and (3) the Defendant&#8217;s failure &#8220;to operate a system that allows for same-sex personal care and/or its refusal to contemplate commissioning such services&#8221;. The pleading stated that these matters were the subject of a decision made on 29 January 2024. This date was a reference to a letter to the Claimant&#8217;s father from Rachel Lukwage, Corporate Head of Service Localities / Community Learning Disability &amp; Transitions Teams, setting out the outcome of a Stage 1 Adult Social Care Complaint Review undertaken in response to his letter of 27 April 2023. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, the position has evolved quite considerably from the time when the claim was first pleaded. The Claimant no longer pursues the second challenge, as it is accepted that the Defendant is obliged to record the gender of service users in light of directions issued by NHS England, pursuant to powers conferred by sections 254 and 259 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. As regards the matters raised by the first and third challenges, it is now common ground that: the system operated by the Defendant <span style="font-style:italic">allows for</span> same-sex personal care to be provided to service users; the Defendant does not <span style="font-style:italic">refuse</span> to record service user&#8217;s biological sex; the Claimant&#8217;s sex has been recorded in her care plan; local authorities do have the power to provide personal care to service users on a same-sex basis; and it is permissible for social workers to ask the sex of service users.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In light of this changing picture, the apparent measure of agreement and a lack of clarity on this in the parties&#8217; skeleton arguments, I considered it was particularly important to have a clear list of agreed issues in this case. A list had not been provided, as required by CPR 54A PD para 14.7. Accordingly, I directed that an agreed list of issues was to be filed no later than 2pm on 5 February 2025.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An agreed list of issues was duly provided. To a significant extent the contents of this document supersede the Claimant&#8217;s pleaded claim. Whilst no formal application was made to amend the Statement of Facts and Grounds (&#8220;SFG&#8221;), Mr Tankel did not raise any objection to this, realistically accepting that he and his client had prepared for the hearing on the basis of the case that was identified in the list of issues (and perhaps also mindful of the fact that the Defendant&#8217;s position has also moved significantly). </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I will reproduce the relevant parts of the agreed list of issues relating to liability (with the cross references to passages in the skeleton arguments and the pleadings omitted). The following abbreviations are contained within the text: &#8220;C&#8221; for Claimant; &#8220;D&#8221; for Defendant; and &#8220;PSED&#8221; for the public sector equality duty imposed by section 149 of the Equality Act 2010. I adopt the PSED abbreviation in this judgment and I will refer to the alleged duty described at para 1 of the list as &#8220;the Combined Duty&#8221;, to distinguish it from other duties that are referred to in this case.</p>

She cannot write, type, dress herself, wipe herself after using the toilet, deal with menstrual care, eat unsupervised, prepare any snacks, shower or bath herself, and she has no understanding of danger. As a result, it is accepted that she has a need for full-time one-to-one care, including intimate personal care. It is also agreed that she lacks capacity to manage her finances. Her care is currently provided by her parents and by carers employed by her parents, funded by direct payments from the Defendant.</p>

However, this assumption was called into question a few years ago when the school that she was then attending indicated that it was changing its policy on the provision of intimate care from same-sex to cross-gender. After objections were raised, the school reverted to its original policy of providing same-sex intimate care. However, the incident prompted the Claimant&#8217;s parents to check other paperwork relating to her care and they noticed that the Disabled Children&#8217;s Team in the Defendant&#8217;s Achieving for Children (&#8220;AFC&#8221;) collected data on service users&#8217; gender, but not on their sex. Their request that her sex be recorded was unresolved at the time when the Claimant moved to Adult Social Care upon reaching the age of 18.</p>

Ms Reilly says that during the visit she was in no doubt as to the Claimant&#8217;s biological sex, as she is visibly biologically female. In Reilly 1 she observes that as the social worker will physically meet the service user on one or more occasions during the assessment process, this is an opportunity to note any external indicators of biological sex.</p>

She considers that her daughter can only be adequately safeguarded if the Defendant recognises that same-sex care means that the carer and the service user have the same biological sex. In SR3, the Claimant&#8217;s mother emphasises that whilst VRP has very limited mental capacity, she has strong feelings about what happens to her and to her body and her responses indicate that she knows, for example, that someone touching her genitalia is somehow different to someone touching her shoulder.</p>

She says that as far as she is aware, the gender of all the service users that she has worked with has corresponded to their sex, but that the assessment process provides many opportunities to confirm or contradict that assumption. Whilst the Defendant does not have a formal policy for the provision of same-sex intimate personal care, even where no specific request has been made &#8220;my expectation would be that wherever possible, female clients receive personal care support from female carers&#8221;. Ms Reilly regards this as being &#8220;industry standard&#8221; within social care. She says that where families (usually those of young women) specifically request same-sex intimate care &#8220;then I expressly mention it in the assessment and support plan&#8221;, albeit this would be the default position for female service users in any event. She goes on to say that she is not personally aware of any instance where it has not been possible to arrange same-sex intimate care for a female service user, where that has been requested. She stresses that in addition to the wording of the alert, the needs assessment states that the Claimant is female and there are references to her being female throughout her records on the IAS.</p>

There are therefore no plans to collect the &#8216;sex&#8217; data item at this stage as ASC has no intention for single sex provisions.

She explains that within the IAS, for each service user there is a client record front page which has key information about the user, such as their name, date of birth, address, contact details and certain demographic information such as gender and ethnicity. Some of the fields, including the gender field, are mandatory (meaning that the person inputting the data cannot progress to the next section of the form until this is completed). So far as gender is concerned, Ms O&#8217;Driscoll believes that this is because of the statutory reporting duties that I have referred to (para 6 above). I have itemised the drop-down options in respect of gender at para 25 above. O&#8217;Driscoll 1 says that social workers will use the wider needs assessment to capture any more detailed description of a person&#8217;s gender or sex, that it might be necessary to record.</p>

However, she says that the Defendant cannot implement this particular update immediately because it is currently in the process of moving its data management over to a cloud-based system and delivering a system upgrade in the middle of such a migration would make troubleshooting any issues relating to the update very difficult. Ms O&#8217;Driscoll says that she has been informed by the Defendant&#8217;s ICT team that it has been decided to wait until after the migration is complete before introducing this update. When I explored this with Mr Tankel, he said that the sex reporting field was definitely going to be introduced by the Defendant, but that it would not be a mandatory reporting field, meaning social workers could decide whether or not to include an entry.</p>

However, she acknowledges that the new &#8220;sex&#8221; field will be of some practical use in cases where an individual&#8217;s sex and gender are not aligned, as it will provide a quick-reference indicator to anyone familiarising themselves with a case. She says that if someone specifically wanted their biological sex to be recorded, she cannot see any reason why the &#8220;sex&#8221; field would not be used in that individual case.

Like Ms Reilly, Ms O&#8217;Driscoll observes that it can usually be safely assumed that where &#8220;male&#8221; or &#8220;female&#8221; is entered in the mandatory gender field, this will also be the individual&#8217;s biological sex. She says that this assumption is borne out by experience and that within the team, the two concepts are used interchangeably. The exception to this is where there is some indication in the paperwork to the contrary, which she would expect to be apparent on the face of the assessment, as such information is likely to be highly relevant to their support planning (the only exception would be where the service user had positively asked for this not to be mentioned).</p>

Accordingly, the majority of adults receiving care and support via the Defendant, will have their care delivered by a female carer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">O&#8217;Driscoll 1 also details the commissioning arrangements that apply when the Defendant arranges the care. The Defendant does not directly employ the carers, who are provided by outside agencies commissioned by Kingston via a brokerage service. Any care agency providing personal care is required to be regulated by the Care Quality Commission (&#8220;CQC&#8221;).  Ms O&#8217;Driscoll says it is her understanding that regulated domiciliary care agencies are required by law to try to meet requests for same-sex care where such requests are made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms O&#8217;Driscoll indicates that there are various stages during the ordinary operation of the commissioning process that would naturally result in same-sex care being provided, especially, but not only, where a service user or their family had requested this. There is the regulatory aspect that I have just mentioned. In addition, the service user&#8217;s needs will have been assessed and a support plan prepared and a copy of these documents will be sent to the brokerage service. The care plan will contain details of the service user&#8217;s preferences and there is a specific section in the plan for the social worker to advise the brokerage service of such needs. Ms O&#8217;Driscoll says that in her experience, care agencies always provide same-sex intimate care by default, especially where the service user is female.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Domiciliary care services are commissioned via the Defendant&#8217;s Care at Home Framework. Once the brokerage team has identified a provider, they will advise the proposed provide of any special requirements in the package of care. This would include, where relevant, any request for same-sex care. Once the provider accepts the package, brokerage will send a confirmation email along with the Individual Placement Agreement (&#8220;IPA&#8221;) and a copy of the care plan. Ms O&#8217;Driscoll also details the arrangements that apply to commissioning supported living placements and when a placement in a care home is being arranged. She notes that the Defendant&#8217;s standard terms and conditions require all providers to follow the requested support plan or, if they are unable to meet the request, to notify the Defendant (and that this would include specific requests for same-sex care). The brokerage identifies the care provider and then it is for that agency to carry out its own assessment to identify which of its carers are capable of providing support to the particular service user in question. This will generally be the result of discussions between the family and the care agency. The local authority has relatively limited involvement in the selection of individual carers. Ms Driscoll also says that families are encouraged to have a lot of direct communication with the care providers about the specifics of the care that is required.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition to the regulation by the CQC that I have already referred to, Ms O&#8217;Driscoll notes that all carers providing personal care to adults are required to undertake an enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (&#8220;DBS&#8221;) check. In addition, the Defendant has its own quality assurance (&#8220;QA&#8221;) process. Its QA team carry out spot checks on services and, if specific concerns are raised, targeted visits are undertaken. Where there are concerns about individual care delivery or a provider not meeting the client&#8217;s needs, the Defendant&#8217;s Provider Quality Assurance Framework (&#8220;QAF&#8221;) is followed with a view to delivering the required improvements. Further, where a care and support plan is being delivered, the service user, or those acting on their behalf, can raise concerns with the care provider and/or with the local authority. Ms Driscoll describes the Defendant&#8217;s processes for dealing with such concerns at paras 46 &#8211; 49 of Driscoll 1.</p>

As with service users, her team would ordinarily assume that if a carer was provided on the basis that she is a &#8220;female&#8221; carer, then this means the person in question is biologically female. She says that care agencies would be alive to the risk of placing someone who is known to be biologically male but declaring that they are female, in a setting with a vulnerable female; and that families / service users can request to change carers if there are concerns. </p>

At the hearing, Mr Tankel indicated that the finalisation of this document was still some months away, given the difficulties of comprehensively capturing current practice in writing and of sufficiently identifying the exceptional circumstances that could arise; and the need to consult with various different interests. Mr Tankel said he preferred to refer to it as an operational scheme, rather than a policy.</p>

The Defendant undertakes contract monitoring, which includes: seeing that care providers have up to date DBS checks for all staff; reviewing whether staff have provided sufficient references and that gaps in employment have been fully explored; sampling the providers&#8217; policies and procedures and staff appraisals; and checking that complaints have been acted upon. The QAF includes Quality Assurance and Contract Management officers routinely visiting providers to monitor the services delivered, both via announced and unannounced visits. The Defendant also holds Provider Forums on a regular basis, based on themes gathered from the quality concerns and other sources of information.</p>

The provision of cross-sex care is such a departure from the norm as understood across the sector that I would expect a provider to contact the relevant social worker, or the duty social worker, if they found themselves having to provide cross-sex care on a particular occasion, perhaps because of an ad hoc staffing issue. If a supplier were routinely finding themselves unable to provide same-sex care, then I would regard that as a contractual issue that would need to be addressed via the processes I have described above.&#8221;</p>

Section 13(3) states that where at least some of the adult&#8217;s needs for care and support meet the eligibility criteria, the local authority must consider what could be done to meet those needs, ascertain whether the adult wants to have those needs met by the local authority and establish whether the adult is ordinarily resident in the local authority&#8217;s area. For present purpose, it is unnecessary to detail the eligibility criteria. Section 18(1) places a duty on the local authority to meet the adult&#8217;s needs for care and support which meet the eligibility criteria if the adult is ordinarily resident in the authority&#8217;s area (or is present in the areas and of no settled residence) and the other requirements of subsection (1) are met.</p>

The statutory guidance provides that in undertaking its activities under the Act, a local authority &#8220;should consider how to ensure that the person is and remains protected from abuse of neglect&#8221; (para 1.14(g)). It goes on to say that all of the matters listed in section 1(3) must be considered in relation to every individual when the local authority carries out its functions, so that a person&#8217;s life is looked at holistically (para 1.15). It goes on to acknowledge that the relevance of the listed factors will differ in their application to particular individuals: &#8220;every person is different and the matters of most importance to them will accordingly vary widely&#8221; (para 1.16). The text clarifies that neither these principles nor the requirement to promote wellbeing, require the local authority to take any particular action; that will &#8220;depend entirely on the circumstances&#8221; (para 1.17).</p>

Secondly, the decision maker &#8220;must be clear precisely what the equality implications are when he puts them in the balance&#8221;. Thirdly, as to the extent to which the PSED entailed a duty of inquiry, Elias LJ said: &#8220;If the relevant material is not available, there will be a duty to acquire it and this will frequently mean than [sic] some further consultation with the appropriate groups is required&#8221;.</p>

Accordingly, I will simply mention that aspect very briefly and for completeness. Schedule 3 of the Act contains exceptions that apply to the provision of services and the exercise of public functions. Paragraphs 26 and 27 of Schedule 3 identify various circumstances where the provision of separate services for persons of each sex or the provision of a service to persons of only one sex would not contravene the Act. There is an overarching requirement that this is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. Additionally, paragraph 28 provides that section 29 is not contravened so far as gender reassignment discrimination is concerned in relation to the provision of separate services for persons of each sex, the provision of separate services differently for persons of each sex and the provision of a service only to persons of one sex, if the conduct in question is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. Whilst I am primarily concerned with the position of service users, rather than that of the carers, I also note that para 1 of Schedule 9 contains the following exception to the discrimination in work provisions of the Act:</p>

Generally speaking, the first two aspects of these positive obligations are classified as &#8216;substantive&#8217;, while the third aspect corresponds to the State&#8217;s positive &#8216;procedural&#8217; obligation.&#8221;</p>

I will use the terminology adopted by Lewis LJ of a systems duty and an operational duty in this judgment. The Claimant&#8217;s arguments appeared, at times, to conflate these two positive duties. However, during the course of her oral submissions and in response to questions from the Court, Ms Monaghan clarified that it was the systems duty that was relied upon. Accordingly, I will not unnecessarily lengthen this judgment by including references to citations that I was taken to that relate to the operational duty, such as passages in <span style="font-style:italic">Z v United</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Kingdom</span> (2002) 34 EHRR 3 and in <span style="font-style:italic">Worcestershire CC</span>. (It is in any event plain that the instant case would not meet the criteria for the operational duty to arise; in particular there is no &#8220;real and immediate risk&#8221; to the Claimant of conduct causing her inhuman or degrading treatment or a breach of her Article 8 rights, not least as the current arrangement, intended to remain in place for as long as they are able to do so, is that her parents, rather than the Defendant, arrange her carers).</p>

That case was concerned with Article 2 as well as Article 3 and thus there are references in the passage that I will cite to the protection of life. However, Johnson J noted at para 5 that the parties before him were agreed that there was no practical difference between the content of the positive obligations that arise under Article 2 on the one hand, and Article 3 on the other hand.

In short, Julian Knowles J concluded that the measures put in place by the Secretary of State were not adequate and effective to prevent the breaches of Article 8 in relation to the strip-searching of the claimants over the relevant time period,  because they were not adequate or effective in ensuring that the operator had proper and suitable systems in place for training its staff on strip-searching (para 115).</p>

As I have indicated, the Claimant&#8217;s case is that the Combined Duty arises from the combined effect of the duties imposed by section 1 of the Care Act 2014, the PSED and the entitlement not to suffer indirect discrimination (as defined by section 19 of the Equality Act 2010), and the positive obligations arising in respect of Articles 3 and 8 ECHR. Unlike earlier written iterations of this argument (prior to the agreed list of issues), Ms Monaghan accepted during her oral submissions that the Combined Duty would admit of the kind of exceptions identified by Mr Tankel at para 48 of his skeleton argument, such as where no same-sex carer is available and there is an urgent need to provide care.</p>

Ms Monaghan said that, in turn, this means that she is entitled to a system that will ensure that intimate care is provided to her by a carer of the same-sex and that the Defendant&#8217;s argument that the risk of care being provided by a male carer can be discounted, fails to afford proper respect to this right. As regards Article 3 ECHR, it is emphasised that women represent the overwhelming majority of those who are subject to sexual abuse, that disabled women are at a particular risk, and that given the overwhelming majority of perpetrators of such abuse are male, an adequate system of same-sex personal and intimate care is reasonable and necessary.</p>

It is said that this puts female service users at a particular disadvantage in comparison to male service users as the women will have a particular need for same-sex services for personal and intimate care by reason of their vulnerability to sexual abuse and the greater risk that male carers present of perpetrating such abuse, and also for reasons of personal dignity and privacy. Ms Monaghan acknowledged that the Claimant&#8217;s care needs are not currently being met by carers arranged by the Defendant, but she submitted that the PCP nonetheless &#8220;puts, or would put [her] at that disadvantage&#8221; because it creates the identified risks for her that could materialise at any point in the future.</p>

She said that by operating a system of not recording the sex of service users when carrying out assessments for social care and drawing up care plans, the Defendant was unable to give effect to service users&#8217; right to same-sex care and would not have the information available to identify, evaluate and address any discriminatory impacts on a protected group, as the PSED requires.</p>

Furthermore, the complaint was not about abuse per se, but about the extent to which there was a heightened risk of abuse over and above the risk of abuse that was also faced by male service users. He also argued that if the Article 3 systems duty did apply, it was satisfied, as this was a highly regulated area under which the Defendant already had an appropriate system in place. He relied upon the nature and depth of the assessments undertaken under the Care Act 2014; the Defendant&#8217;s commissioning processes, its contractual arrangements with care providers and the contract monitoring and QA that took place, along with the opportunity to raise complaints (as described by Ms O&#8217;Driscoll); and the regulation of care agencies by the CQC and the detailed requirements upon those providing personal care imposed by the 2014 Regulations (paras 68 &#8211; 75 above).

Mr Tankel relied upon similar points in relation to Article 8, also emphasising that this was a qualified right and considerations of proportionality were in play.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Tankel contended that the Equality Act 2010 did not assist the Claimant. There was no relevant PCP, simply an absence of a specific, articulated policy of the kind that was sought. Furthermore, if that absence could amount to a PCP, it had not been applied to the Claimant and/or had not put her at a disadvantage, as her biological sex had been recorded, the Defendant had indicated that the preference expressed for same-sex care would be adhered to and in any event the Defendant was not arranging her care at this juncture. He also disputed that female service users more generally were put at a disadvantage, as under the Defendant&#8217;s system, service users received the care most appropriate to them. If it was necessary to do so, Mr Tankel indicated that he relied upon the Defendant&#8217;s approach constituting a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim of providing adult social care in a way that balanced the potentially competing factors in an individual case. At para 48 of his skeleton argument, Mr Tankel gave examples of where same-sex care would not necessarily be the right answer.</p>

This is reinforced by the provisions of the Statutory Guidance that I have highlighted (para 67 above). In the circumstances, I accept Mr Tankel&#8217;s submission that the legislation requires a fact-sensitive needs assessment that is tailored to the particular person. Whilst it is right to note that &#8220;personal dignity&#8221; and &#8220;protection from abuse and neglect&#8221; are recognised as central aspects of a person&#8217;s well-being (para 61 above), the statutory provisions envisage that these and other aspects of a person&#8217;s well-being will be promoted via the detailed needs assessment and care support plan created in each case. This is further reinforced by the evidence of Ms Reilly and Ms O&#8217;Driscoll, both as to the detailed and personalised nature of these assessments and their confirmation that, where relevant, a service user&#8217;s sex will be recorded in their documentation held on the IAS (paras 20, 24, 34, 44 and 46 &#8211; 50 above). I consider the Defendant&#8217;s evidence as to its current practice in greater detail from para 128 below, however, in short, no basis has been shown to doubt that evidence. The careful recording of the Claimant&#8217;s sex further supports the Defendant&#8217;s case in this regard (paras 24, 29 &#8211; 30 and 32 above).</p>

As Mr Tankel points out, if Parliament had wished to do so, it could have included a provision imposing the Combined Duty (or something similar to it) in the Care Act. Equally, the lengthy Statutory Guidance contains nothing that is indicative of or supportive of the existence of the Combined Duty. I also note that if the alleged duty was accepted by the Court as generally applying to female service users, it could potentially conflict with the multi-factorial assessments that the Care Act envisages taking place in each case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I understand it, Article 3 is relied upon by the Claimant in respect of the heightened risk of physical and psychological abuse, including sexual abuse, that arises from the provision of cross-sex personal and intimate care and/or a system that fails to take steps to guard against the provision of such care on a cross-sex basis. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no evidence that an abusive situation of this nature has arisen in the Defendant&#8217;s provision of Adult Social Care; rather (as Mr Tankel emphasises), it is the increased risk of such abuse were cross-sex care provided in comparison to the lower risk in a system of same-sex care, that is said to give rise to the Article 3 low level systems duty. Given the relatively high threshold that conduct must reach to amount to &#8220;inhuman or degrading treatment&#8221; and given that the evidence does not suggest the risks of this occurring are other than at a low level (para 118 above), I do not find that an Article 3 positive obligation is triggered by these circumstances. However, and in any event, if such a duty does exist, it is met by the existing arrangements, practices and safeguards, as I go on to discuss in relation to Article 8. Before doing so, I note as significant in relation to any duty arising under Article 3, that the <span style="font-style:italic">likelihood</span> of the risk occurring is relevant to the question of what is required of the public authority; the duty is not an absolute one, where the lower level systems duty arises the public authority mut implement measures to reduce the risk to &#8220;a reasonable minimum&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">MG</span> at para 95 above).</p>

Furthermore, the Defendant&#8217;s evidence indicates that in practice &#8211; and save for in the kind of exceptional situations that I refer to in para 133 below &#8211; same-sex personal and intimate care <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> provided to service users: see paras 34, 48, 50 and 51 above. The Claimant has provided no evidence to gainsay this and I accept the Defendant&#8217;s evidence in this regard. Ms Monaghan referred to three aspects in support of her suggestion that I should regard the Defendant&#8217;s evidence as unsatisfactory. For the reasons that I identify in the paragraphs immediately following, I do not accept that this is the case or that these matters undermine the clear and specific accounts given by Ms Reilly and Ms O&#8217;Driscoll, which I have already set out in detail.</p>

In the relevant passage, Ms O&#8217;Driscoll specifically qualifies the text that follows by indicating that she is referring to &#8220;a case in which cross-sex care was <span style="font-style:italic">otherwise the right decision</span>&#8221; (emphasis added).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, Ms Monaghan relied upon the 29 January 2024 letter. It will be recalled that the letter was written in response to a complaint that was primarily about alleged non-compliance with data protection legislation (not an issue raised in these proceedings) and in that context, primarily about the recording of the service user&#8217;s gender (para 35 above), which, again, is no longer a live issue. The response was a less than helpful one in a number of respects. As I have already noted, the passage that I have quoted at para 36 above does not make sense and the author decided to focus a substantial part of the response upon the position of a (hypothetical) transgender carer &#8211; a situation which, I am told, has never arisen in practice - and, in doing so, it is now in effect accepted that the author misunderstood the provisions of the Equality Act 2010 regarding the provisions of same-sex services (paras 11 and 38 above). </p>

They do not. The author stated that the Defendant&#8217;s approach was aligned with its Care Act 2014 duties; the Defendant&#8217;s evidence confirms this. The letter indicated that the authority would use its &#8220;best endeavours&#8221; to comply with the preference that had been expressed on behalf of the Claimant for same-sex care; that is consistent with the Defendant&#8217;s case. The qualification that was then expressed in the letter related to the legal misunderstanding of the position under the Equality Act 2010, rather than to any suggestion that same-sex care was not in fact provided in practice. Finally, the reference to Adult Social Care having no plan to &#8220;introduce single sex services&#8221; appears to be a reference to there being no intention to commence a formalised single sex service; whereas there is no clear reference in the letter to what currently happened in practice in terms of the provision of same-sex care by the Defendant, nor any suggestion that the current practice was going to change.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition to the Defendant&#8217;s evidence, which indicates that same-sex care is provided for female service users, both when requested and as a matter default, there is no evidence at all that difficulties have arisen in practice in the Defendant&#8217;s provision of this. As I have already foreshadowed, the position is factually quite different to that in <span style="font-style:italic">Sodexho</span> &#8211; the main case relied upon by the Claimant in relation to the systems duty (as opposed to the doomed attempt to rely upon the operational duty, which was, rightly, not pursued). In <span style="font-style:italic">Sodexo,</span> there were admitted breaches of the Article 8 negative obligation and a related breach of the systems duty by the operator of the prison, which provided the basis, in turn, for the finding that the Secretary of State did not have in place adequate and effective safeguards (paras 100 &#8211; 106 above).</p>

The Claimant&#8217;s revised formulation of the Combined Duty (as set out at para 1 of the agreed list of issues) rightly recognises that there may be exceptions where other preferences are expressed or cross-sex care is in the service user&#8217;s best interests, as does Ms O&#8217;Driscoll (para 51 above). In her oral submissions, Ms Monaghan accepted that the examples given at para 48 of Mr Tankel&#8217;s skeleton argument were indeed instances where same-sex care would not necessarily be the right answer. This also underscores the importance of fact-sensitive, individualised evaluation. The examples identified by Mr Tankel included: where there was an urgent need for care to be provided and a female carer was unavailable; a female service-user who exhibited violent and challenging behaviour, such that female carers were not physically strong enough to protect her, themselves and/or others in the vicinity; and a transgender service user who has a preference for intimate care from a carer of their adopted sex.</p>

In her two statements, Ms O&#8217;Driscoll explains the commissioning process and how the information that is given to the care provider would naturally result in same-sex care being provided (paras 54 &#8211; 55 above). She also explains the contract monitoring and QA processes undertaken by the Defendant (paras 56, 59 and 61 above) and how the provision of cross-sex care would be a substantial departure from the norm that is understood across the sector (para 61 above). In addition, there is the external regulation on the care providers. I have referred in detail to the relevant terms of the 2014 Regulations (paras 68 &#8211; 75 above). Further, the statutory guidance for registered care providers expressly states that the provider must make every reasonable effort to respect people&#8217;s preferences as to the sex of a carer who delivers personal or intimate care (para 76 above). Ms O&#8217;Driscoll also explains that care providers are regulated by the CQC and carers are required to undergo DBS checks (paras 53 and 56 above).</p>

Para 3.1.3 states that providers must deliver care against the service users&#8217; care plans and in accordance with the key Care Act 2014 Outcomes (which are listed). The specifics of the Care Act concept of &#8220;well-being&#8221; are articulated at para 3.1.5. The prescribed &#8220;Aims and Objectives&#8221; in part 4.1 of the document include putting the &#8220;health, safety, quality of life and preferences of the Service User at the centre of care provision&#8221; and to &#8220;ensure that the Service User is treated with dignity and respect at all times. Their privacy and individuality will be respected in all aspects of service delivery&#8221; (and para 4.5.9 is to similar effect). Part 4.3 addresses &#8220;Service Requirements&#8221;, which include that the services must be &#8220;person centred, flexible and responsive ensuring that all Service Users are able to exercise choice and control over the services that they receive&#8221;; and that &#8220;Personal care tasks must be undertaken with great sensitivity&#8221;. Following a referral, a care provider is expected to undertaker &#8220;their own full and comprehensive care plan&#8221; to compliment the plan prepared by the local authority and this is to be reviewed a minimum of every six months (paras 4.51. &#8211; 4.5.4). The document indicates that care providers who fail to maintain adherence to the performance requirements will be managed in accordance with the framework agreement; and there are detailed sections of the document dealing with &#8220;Unsatisfactory Behaviour&#8221;, complaints and feedback, and the &#8220;Performance Framework&#8221;.</p>

However, as Ms Monaghan drew attention to in the Supported Living terms and conditions document, the text under the heading &#8220;Sustainability, Equalities, Social Values and Other Impacts&#8221; says that &#8220;[t]he Service will respond positively to the needs of diverse individuals, specifically needs relating to the characteristics protected by the Equalities [sic] Act 2010&#8221;. The protected characteristics are then listed, but with a reference to &#8220;gender&#8221; in place of &#8220;sex&#8221;. Whilst this means that neither of these terms and conditions documents contain an accurate list of the Equality Act protected characteristics, I do not consider that this of itself undermines the detailed regulatory framework or monitoring system that I have described. There is no evidence that it has done so in practice and it has to be set against the considerable emphasis in the terms and conditions upon the matters that I have highlighted.</p>

If the PCP is couched in such wide and imprecise terms it is difficult to assess or show this. The Claimant&#8217;s real complaint (as the formulation of the Combined Duty makes clear) is that the Defendant does not have in place a system that ensures, or which has the objective of ensuring, same-sex care and this is said to particularly disadvantage female service users because they have a greater need for same-sex care for reasons of dignity and privacy and because they are at greater risk of abuse than male service users if cross-sex care is provided.

As is well-known, it is a duty of means (to have &#8220;due regard&#8221; to the specified matters), it is not a duty to achieve any particular outcome (para 83 above). Accordingly, it does not in itself support the existence of the alleged substantive duty to ensure the provision of same-sex personal and intimate care.</p>

The argument is primarily put on the basis that this obligation is ancillary to the Combined Duty, as the absence of a requirement to record service users&#8217; sex would mean that the Defendant was not in a position to discharge that duty. As I have rejected the existence of the Combined Duty, the main foundation of the Claimant&#8217;s argument falls away. </p>

However, for the reasons I have already indicated, I am satisfied that the Defendant&#8217;s evidence indicates that this does occur in practice, in that either the service user&#8217;s sex is specifically recorded in their notes or, in any event, their sex is clearly apparent from the material on IAS regarding the particular service user; that this material is supplied to care providers and also reflected in the documentation that they compile; and that same-sex care is in fact appropriately provided to the Defendant&#8217;s female service-users. Moreover, that this position currently exists, undermines the underlying premise of the Claimant&#8217;s argument that appropriate same-sex care will not be provided unless there is a system requiring the recording of sex in each case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is unnecessary for me to decide whether the 29 January 2024 letter in fact contained each of the three alleged policies or decisions that were initially challenged in the Claim Form (para 5 above), as matters have moved on since then. It is no longer alleged that the Defendant has a general policy of not recording the sex of service users when carrying out Care Act 2014 assessments and it is accepted that, contrary to the pleaded assertion, the Claimant&#8217;s sex is recorded in her care plan. The second challenge (regarding gender recording) has fallen away altogether. The third challenge has been reformulated, it being accepted that the Defendant&#8217;s system <span style="font-style:italic">allows</span> for same-sex personal care. The reformulated policy challenge (para 11 above) and the grounds in the agreed list of issues, have been formulated, or re-formulated, in light of the Defendant&#8217;s evidence, rather than by reference to the specifics of the 29 January 2024 letter. In short, whilst it is an unsatisfactory letter in a number of respects (para 131 above), it is not a document that sets out the policies that are now challenged in these proceedings. Further, in so far as the Claimant&#8217;s parents were concerned about the letter&#8217;s apparent misunderstanding of the Equality Act 2010 provisions relating to the provision of same-sex services, I have recorded in this judgment what is now the parties&#8217; agreed position in that regard (paras 11, 38, 40 and 87 above).</p>

The Claimant has not adduced any evidence to the contrary. The Claimant herself is not currently in receipt of personal care provided by the Defendant and thus there is no suggestion that the Defendant has failed to provide same-sex care in her case.</p>

For the reasons I have identified at paras 125 &#8211; 137, the Defendant&#8217;s systems and practices adequately and effectively safeguards against breaches of Articles 3 and/or 8 ECHR in respect of the provision of same-sex personal and intimate care. The Claimant&#8217;s case on indirect discrimination fails for the multiple reasons I have set out at paras 138 &#8211; 144 above, each of which is fatal in itself to that contention.
