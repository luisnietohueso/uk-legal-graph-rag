Accordingly, the tribunal had been entitled to find that the Respondent&#8217;s decision to treat the Claimant&#8217;s conduct as grounds for dismissal for gross misconduct was reasonable in all the circumstances of the case and the appeal is dismissed.</span></p>

The Respondent had concluded that the Claimant had been dishonest in the completion in May 2019 of his application form for employment, in that he had failed to disclose that he had previously been dismissed for gross misconduct by the Home Office in 2016 and had been unemployed for about 3 months in the summer of 2016 as a consequence. </span></p>

In particular, it is the Claimant&#8217;s case that the employment tribunal failed to grapple with whether, in the context of an application form which included a blank text box headed, &#8216;employment history&#8217;, the Respondent was entitled to conclude that the reasonable applicant should have presented that history in such a way that the vacancy holder would be able to identify any gaps in employment and would have been aware that his previous period of employment with the Home Office had ended in dismissal.</span></p>

A disciplinary investigation was launched in about May 2020 into allegations that the Claimant had failed to disclose his material details in his application, namely (i) that he had previously been dismissed by the Home Office for gross misconduct and (ii) that he had a serious underlying medical condition which would potentially impact on his ability to carry out the position for which he applied.</span></p>

In them, the Claimant made claims of unfair dismissal, victimisation, discrimination on grounds of age and/or disability and detriment due to making a protected disclosure. The Claimant acted in person. It is common ground before me that the Claimant&#8217;s complaints covered a broad range of different legal issues at the employment tribunal. A significant theme of his claim was that his dismissal in 2020 was tainted by the substance of the allegations made against him leading to his earlier dismissal in 2016, which had been disputed at the time and subsequently compromised in the earlier tribunal proceedings.</span></p>

It notes that the point on which this appeal now solely focusses was one of many about which the Claimant complaining in his ET1 and that at the hearing before the Tribunal the issue was only raised with Mr Finch in cross-examination. The Respondent submits that the Tribunal established that the Claimant&#8217;s subjective understanding of the purpose of the need to provide employment history on the application form was to ascertain whether there had been any periods of unemployment or any dismissals (at &#167;49 of its judgment), a finding which it was entitled to make as it reflected the Claimant&#8217;s own evidence.

The Tribunal had found that the Claimant knew that his previous dismissal and the gap in employment were relevant to the Respondent&#8217;s decision whether to employ him a second time, (see the findings at &#167;&#167;47-49), and therefore it had clearly concluded that it was open to the Respondent to find that the Claimant&#8217;s choice not to include that information was done deliberately and dishonestly.</span></p>

Indeed, those were the express terms of reference for the investigating officer, as the Tribunal had found.</span></p>

This, in my judgment, is further support for the fact that the Tribunal heard the evidence on this issue in full and that its determination that Mr Finch&#8217;s investigation was &#8216;extremely thorough&#8217; was by reference to the correct issues which the Respondent had to decide. It seems to me that the Tribunal&#8217;s finding (&#167;114) that the Respondent was entitled to consider that the Claimant had a case to answer cannot be criticised. It was one which was entirely open to the Tribunal on the evidence and there is nothing I can discern from any of the matters which have been canvassed before which supports the suggestion that it failed to consider whether Mr Finch had the right issues in mind.</span></p>

These findings engage directly with the issue of whether it was reasonable for the Respondent to consider the Claimant&#8217;s completion of the application form to be deliberately or recklessly inadequate.</span></p>

That may be because the Claimant did not refer the Tribunal to the case himself. However, in my judgment that does not mean that the Tribunal has failed to grapple with the fundamental point being made by the Claimant: in my judgment it clearly recognised that there was a debate regarding the extent of the duty on the Claimant to volunteer the information about his past dismissal at the disciplinary hearing which the Claimant sought to justify his conduct. </span></p>

But his arguments that the omissions were genuine errors or oversights, or that they occurred in the honest belief that the information was not needed or sought by the application process, or that the conduct was not of such seriousness as to warrant dismissal were all aired in the disciplinary process and the Tribunal considered carefully the Respondent&#8217;s approach to them all. It was not the Tribunal&#8217;s role to go behind those decisions. The Tribunal&#8217;s role was to scrutinise whether the process and the decisions were within a band of reasonable responses. That is exactly what it did.</span></p>

The answer to this point lies in the wider reading of the form itself. The application form clearly contained information which was very likely to be relied upon by the Respondent. That much is apparent from the general declaration which the Claimant signed. The Claimant, as he accepted in cross-examination, was aware that the previous dismissal and subsequent period of unemployment were relevant facts.</span></p>

The Claimant is right to say that he was not given instruction or supervision as to how to complete the form, but the essence of what he was being asked to do was understood by him and it was clearly within his skills and experience to present that information in a comprehensive manner.</span></p>

It would, as the Tribunal found to be well understood by the Claimant (&#167;&#167;47, 49 and 52), go to the heart of the matter if there was a previous dismissal or an employment gap. It was straightforward and basic information to provide, of a kind which is routinely sought in job applications, the reasons for which are well known and obvious. The suggestion that it needs to be spelled out to applicants that they should provide sufficiently precise dates to permit the vacancy holder to understand any gaps in employment has a slight air of unreality about it. The Claimant&#8217;s further evidence of CVs of other individuals only serves to reinforce the Respondent&#8217;s position and does not, in my judgment, assist the Claimant&#8217;s case at all. Each of those applications has, by giving precise periods of employment by reference to months and years, disclosed such short periods of unemployment or gaps as exist. Those can then, should the vacancy holder wish, be explored as part of the application process. The Claimant denied that information and opportunity to the Respondent.</span></p>

First, I accept the Respondent&#8217;s point that it is a large organisation which is effectively an &#8216;umbrella&#8217; for various smaller organisations and that it should not be assumed that there is a single collective corporate memory of all HR records, especially in a large recruitment exercise where some tasks have been outsourced. Secondly, the fact that the Respondent might have found out by other means (and did ultimately do so) does not take away from the Claimant&#8217;s obligations under his declaration in the application form not to withhold relevant information. The failure to disclose deprived the Respondent of the opportunity of exploring the issue at the interview stage and forming its own judgment as to whether employment should be offered considering the full and true facts.</span></p>

The Tribunal&#8217;s task was not to consider whether, had it been aware of the relevant information, the Respondent would nevertheless have decided to engage the Claimant in 2019. The issue was whether the Respondent was entitled to conclude that what it considered to be deliberate withholding of that information was reasonable grounds to conclude that the trust and confidence essential for the employment relationship was destroyed and to dismiss him as a result.</span></p>

That might be correct insofar as this was not a post advertised on the basis that specific prior experience was a condition of the role. However, that overlooks the fact that any vacancy holder has a wider interest in understanding the previous employment history of a candidate than merely post-specific expertise. As I put to the Claimant in the hearing, if a hypothetical candidate had had 80 different jobs in 20 years (a far-fetched example, I appreciate), the employment history information would draw the vacancy holder&#8217;s attention to that fact and permit further information to sought at interview. It seems to me that the employment history was as important for what it did not contain as what it did and would have been well understood by all applicants to be relevant information which needed to be provided accurately, especially in light of the declaration on the form.</span></p>

That argument was also met head on by the Tribunal in its findings (at &#167;102). The Tribunal was satisfied that the reason the Claimant was dismissed was because the Respondent had a genuine belief in his dishonesty in withholding relevant information in his job application and that that such belief was a reasonable one to form having conducted a reasonable investigation in all the circumstances.</span></p>
