	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The claimant was employed as a bus driver.  The employment tribunal upheld a complaint of harassment concerning communications on a number of occasions related to his disability.  That was on the basis not of a malign purpose, but of his reasonable perception of the effect of those communications, which he found embarrassing and upsetting.  The respondent appealed.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The appeal was partially upheld.  The conduct covered by the successful complaint included treatment by managers at certain meetings, and by controllers, who were responsible for monitoring the claimant&#8217;s bus on its route.  The tribunal&#8217;s conclusions in relation to the claimant&#8217;s perception of the conduct of managers at two of the meetings in question being reasonable, were, in all the circumstances, not sufficiently explained.  In relation to a third meeting with a manager, the tribunal had itself found that on that occasion there was no reference made at all to anything connected with the claimant&#8217;s disability.  The judge acknowledged that error in a reconsideration decision, but it had not been corrected by the tribunal.  It should have been, as it affected the scope of the judgment.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">However, findings of harassment by other communications involving the controllers of the claimant&#8217;s bus route were properly reached and explained.  Because those findings survived the appeal, the tribunal had not erred by failing to dismiss the overall complaint as being entirely out of time.</span></p>

Following a hearing at London South in January 2023 the tribunal (EJ K Andrews, Mr K Murphy and Mr C Wilby), in a reserved decision, upheld a complaint by the claimant of disability-related harassment, but dismissed his various other complaints.  This is the respondent&#8217;s appeal against the decision upholding the harassment complaint.  Applications by both parties for reconsideration of parts of the overall decision were refused by the judge on preliminary consideration in a further decision on paper.</span></p>

As he did before the employment tribunal, and at the rule 3(10) hearing, Mr Nuttman, a solicitor, appeared for the respondent.  The claimant has been a litigant in person throughout.  He had been debarred by the Registrar from taking any further part in this appeal, as he had filed his Answer late and did not formally apply for an extension.  However, he attended the hearing of this appeal and asked to be heard.  Mr Nuttman did not object, and I permitted the claimant to be heard.  He confirmed that he was able to participate in English, without an interpreter.  We took comfort breaks as required.  The claimant had been sent the bundles and Mr Nuttman&#8217;s skeleton argument, but had not brought his hard copies with him.  He was provided with hard copies before argument began.</span></p>

The standard shift for drivers was 7.36 hours with overtime paid only when a controller authorised it on the basis of unavoidable delay, by signing a docket submitted by the driver.  Driving is normally done in two blocks with one 40-minute unpaid meal break in between.  In each block the driver will drive back and forth on their assigned route.  Once it has been completed in one direction there is time allowed to check the bus for lost property, change signage and take a toilet break, and then the route is started again in the other direction.  At [41] the tribunal said this:</span></p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.79in"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">&#8220;Drivers are line managed by a staff manager (in the claimant's case Ms S Mitchell) but are monitored operationally by controllers who are based either in the ibus (or control) room or are mobile i.e. at the garage, on routes and/or at stops. Each route has a certain frequency and a headway i.e. the timetabled gap between each bus. If a controller sees that a bus is delayed they will radio the driver to establish the cause of the delay and whether any adjustments need to be made to the route and preceding/following buses. Drivers are not expected to talk to a controller whilst they are driving but to contact them when they are next stationary at a stop. If a bus is running late it can get further delayed by the fact that there will be more passengers waiting at a stop than usual which increases loading time and, as there are more passengers on the bus it is more likely to stop frequently. Ultimately a controller may decide to curtail a bus i.e. terminate it earlier than scheduled or instruct a driver to wait at a stop to increase the gap between them and another bus or to overtake a bus in front.&#8221;</span></p>

His line manager, Ms Mitchell, asked for a medical letter in support.  A GP&#8217;s letter dated 4 December 2017 was then provided, indicating that he was suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms.  The letter advised that he was unable to manage his symptoms on long routes, but could manage them very well on short ones, and therefore it was advisable that he be kept on short routes.  At some point thereafter he was allocated to route H37, which has toilet facilities at both ends of the route, as well as part way along, at Hounslow garage.  The tribunal said at [44]: &#8220;In normal conditions it would take 30 to 35 minutes to complete.  Its headway was 6 &#8211; 8 minutes &#8211; a high frequency route.&#8221;</span></p>

He was then invited to a welfare meeting with Ms Mitchell.  He raised a grievance about that invitation and a manager, Mr Harris, responded to this explaining the purpose of the welfare meeting.  The welfare meeting with Ms Mitchell then went ahead, it appears on or around 14 May.  The tribunal said:</span></p>

He did however say that he had called the ambulance because he felt dizzy, was sweating and had a headache. He also referred to Mr Etheridge asking him to 'please watch your headway'. In that meeting he also referred to controllers not answering calls or responding to texts but he confirmed that this was not just in respect of him but other drivers as well. </span></p>

The claimant confirmed that he did and Mr Fojtik said 'okay, when you come back depart straightaway'. He also complained that on the same occasion another controller Mr Pearce had asked him to come and see him at lunchtime and that for the past three days he had been calling and watching him regarding his headways. When Ms Mitchell said that checking headways were part of his job, the claimant said 'okay forget about headways'. At the conclusion of the meeting Ms Mitchell asked if there was anything else going on that she needed to be aware of and the claimant said no.&#8221;</span></p>

There was then a further long-term sickness meeting on 21 May 2018 at which the claimant complained of stress and sleep problems, but did not refer to his urinary-tract condition.

The report noted that on the day of the code red incident the claimant's perception was that 'an Assistant Supervisor was going to chase him as he was going to the toilet' and he felt that it could not be fair and that being asked to go and see that supervisor in his lunchtime break made him feel extra stress. He also said that he had a past history of problems with urinary tract infections and had medication to help with that 'which he now takes intermittently'. He also referred to the letter from his GP from December 2017 and the need to avoid long routes. OH confirmed that the claimant was fit to return to work and that no other recommendations or modifications were needed subject to him being able to pass urine at work. The report stated that it was likely that his condition would 'come under' the Equality Act due to its duration. It did not specifically say what that condition was but it is apparent from the other contents of the report that it is more than likely that this was a reference to the claimant's urinary tract condition. </span></p>

He interviewed the claimant on 5 June 2018 in the course of which there was a discussion about the claimant's use of the toilet facilities. He again reported that he believed Mr Pearce had been checking on him on that occasion and that after the ambulance had been called Mr Pearce and another controller came down to look after him. Mr Etheridge also interviewed controllers including Mr Fojtik and Mr Pearce. Mr Fotjik confirmed that he and Mr Pearce had gone down to check on the claimant 'as he frequently used the toilet facilities' and 'we wanted to make sure if he was okay and if there was something wrong after having to use the toilet facilities that many time within short trips'. Mr Pearce confirmed that he had been alerted by Mr Fojtik that the claimant was frequently using the toilet facilities and as there were delays they needed to manage departures. He later said 'the driver was constantly using the toilet at either end and as we had a duty of care we wanted to make sure he was okay' and that he had asked the claimant to see him on his return for his break. </span></p>

However, the disciplinary hearing on 18 July 2018 was abandoned when the claimant became stressed.  He was then signed off with stress for a month and raised a grievance, which was unsuccessful.  He also raised further grievances relating to various matters on 27 September and 5 October.  This included a grievance that he was being given insufficient time to complete his route without speeding, which caused him to run late, and that controllers had refused to pay overtime.  </span></p>

There is no evidence to support this allegation. To the contrary there was significant evidence that the claimant routinely notified the controllers that he needed and was taking a toilet break. The only time that the claimant soiled himself because he could not take a break in time, he had not informed the control room of the situation. </span></p>

This is in effect a reformulation of the 'arising from' claim above. Because of the way the respondent's drivers' shifts work, they are paid for the shift which is performed in two blocks with an unpaid break in the middle and only if they run late at the end of the shift for an unavoidable reason, they are paid overtime. The evidence shows that when the claimant was not paid overtime this was not because he had taken toilet breaks but because he had run late for other, avoidable, reasons as referred to above in the 'arising from' conclusion.&#8221;</span></p>

These conversations/discussions had started no later than Ms Mitchell's welfare meeting with the claimant in May 2018 and continued throughout 2018 (various occasions involving Mr Fojtik and Mr Pearce as well as the investigatory interview with Mr Etheridge in June and an ibus report in October). Ms Mitchell referred to it again in the long term sick interview in January 2019 and the claimant told OH in the same month that he felt targeted in this regard. (Although technically out of scope for a claim submitted in February 2019, further ibus reports referred to the issue in March , April and November 2019 as well as a further welfare meeting with Ms Mitchell in September 2019.) </span></p>

Although the claimant is someone who seems to be quick to take offence and to complain, the respondent had been put on notice at the latest in May 2018 of his need for frequent toilet breaks and the medical reasons for this. Despite this, his controllers did regularly comment on/ask about his need to go to the toilet and Mr Britto's letter of 20 December 2018 implicitly acknowledged that the relevant information had not been properly communicated by recommending 'better communication amongst departments' and 'a full audit of notified medical conditions and reasonable adjustments to ensure all relevant people are aware of all relevant information'. Despite this such questions continued into 2019 (for example, by Ms Mitchell in the welfare meeting in September) and even though this did lead on occasion to adjustments to the claimant's departure time, this does not counteract the impact on the claimant. </span></p>

The tribunal therefore needed to consider whether it was reasonable for the claimant to view Ms Mitchell&#8217;s conduct as having the proscribed effect, in that context.  Nevertheless, it was the claimant&#8217;s case that, as the respondent had already been told of his condition, and provided with the GP&#8217;s report, in December 2017, it should not have been necessary further to discuss his condition or its effects at that meeting, at all, which he found unnecessary and upsetting.</span></p>

Further, importantly, at [49] the tribunal found that, although the claimant referred to his need to use toilet facilities &#8220;and Ms Mitchell asked him about that&#8221;, in reply &#8220;he did not specifically refer to his urinary condition&#8221;, and gave </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">other</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> health-related reasons for calling the ambulance.

It did not do so.  I therefore uphold ground 1.</span></p>

The sense of this can also be seen in the tribunal&#8217;s highlighting, in the course of [158] of the original decision, that Mr Britto had himself subsequently acknowledged the need to instigate &#8220;training and reforms on iBus radio etiquette&#8221; and for better communication among departments of relevant information and for &#8220;full audit of notified medical conditions and reasonable adjustments&#8221; to ensure that all relevant people were made aware.</span></p>

First, it was the controllers&#8217; job, when they could see that a bus was delayed starting the next iteration of the route, or running slow, to find out what the problem was, so that it could be addressed.  Given that context, he submitted, it could not have been properly regarded as reasonable to perceive the mere fact of the controllers, when they could see such problems occurring in respect of the claimant&#8217;s bus, making enquiries as to why this was happening, as having the proscribed effect.  Once, again, he argued, the tribunal&#8217;s focus should therefore have been on what, if anything, the controllers said or did during the course of such communications, which the claimant might have reasonably perceived in that way.</span></p>

These included that there were multiple occasions of controllers noting the claimant&#8217;s using the toilet during and at the ends of his route </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">and making no efforts to prevent him doing so</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">; and that when controllers had not signed his overtime docket it was because they were not persuaded that there had been a valid reason for him to work beyond the end of his shift.  The tribunal had given Mr Fojtik&#8217;s reports of 8 and 9 October 2018 as examples of that.  That, submitted Mr Nuttman, was also reinforced by the findings at [150], that there was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">no evidence</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> that the claimant was not allowed to take toilet breaks; and at [151], that when the claimant was not paid overtime it was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">not </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">because he had taken toilet breaks, but because he had run late for what were considered other avoidable reasons.</span></p>

But the tribunal was plainly perfectly aware of that context; and it did not, as such, preclude a finding that a controller had said or done things during the course of a communication, related to the claimant&#8217;s condition, which the claimant reasonably perceived had the proscribed effect.  Thirdly, the tribunal had evidence, from the iBus reports, that the fact of the claimant taking a toilet break or breaks, did form part of the subject matter of the communications on these occasions.  It also found (at [53]) that Mr Fojtik had confirmed that he and Mr Pearce had at one point gone to check on the claimant, as he frequently used the toilet, although they said that they did so to make sure he was OK.</span></p>

It was also clearly part of the claimant&#8217;s case that he was being unduly pressurised to drive faster than was properly achievable, having regard to speed limits, and that this could not be entirely separated out from the impact of his need for frequent toilet breaks on the overall time it took him to complete an iteration of his route.</span></p>

These included measures in relation to &#8220;training on iBus etiquette&#8221; and daily audit of iBus logs, as well as in relation to communications among departments and a &#8220;full audit of reasonable adjustments to ensure that all relevant people are aware of all relevant information.&#8221;  The tribunal was entitled to treat that as evidence tending to support the conclusion that it was reasonable for the claimant to feel that the communications in question had not gone the way that they should have, and had been harassing in effect.</span></p>

That was an error.  However, given that only acts prior to 22 September 2018 were potentially out of time (para 2) and there were several ibus reports in October 2018 that indicated conversations had taken place with the claimant about toilet breaks which, taken together with the claimant telling OH in January 2019 that he felt targeted about toilet breaks and Mr Britto&#8217;s acknowledgment in his letter dated 20 December 2018 that the claimant felt harassed, that error would not significantly impact the conclusions reached by the Tribunal.&#8221;</span></p>

Even if the tribunal had properly found that there was harassment in October 2018, it would not follow that the erroneous finding about January 2019 would &#8220;not significantly impact&#8221; its conclusions.  The fact that the claimant told OH in January 2019 that he felt targeted was no more than evidence of his perception, as such.  It was not sufficient that the judge had acknowledged that there had been an error in the original decision on this point.  That should have led to the substantive decision of the full tribunal being corrected in this regard.  Further, he submitted, had the judge and members considered the matter together, this could also have affected their view of other aspects raised by the reconsideration application.</span></p>

It affected the scope of the judgment, which had effectively upheld the complaint in respect of all of the matters set out at [154].  Given that, as the judge acknowledged, the tribunal had simply erred, because it had failed to take on board its own finding at [97] about what was discussed at that meeting, this error should have been corrected by the tribunal issuing a corrected decision removing it from the scope of the judgment upholding the harassment complaint.

In particular I do not consider that it renders unsafe the tribunal&#8217;s discrete conclusions in relation to communications with the controllers, in particular in October 2018.  The remaining aspect however, is whether there is any knock-on effect for the position regarding time limits.  That is the subject of ground 5.</span></p>

That is because the list of issues identified that, having regard to the dates of ACAS EC and of presentation of the first claim form, any complaint about something that happened before 22 September 2018 would (unless part of conduct continuing after that date) be out of time.  However, while I have upheld ground 3, relating to the meeting with Ms Mitchell in January 2019, I have not upheld ground 4, relating to the controller communications in October 2018.  As those occurred after 22 September 2018, the conclusion that, so far as meritorious, the complaint was in time, holds good.</span></p>

This concerns the fact that at [154] the tribunal also referred to further iBus reports referring to the issue in March, April and November 2019 as well as the further welfare meeting with Ms Mitchell in September 2019.  The tribunal noted in doing so that these were &#8220;technically out of scope&#8221; for a claim submitted in February 2019, but it did nevertheless mention them, and at the end of [158] it did refer again to the welfare meeting in September 2019.  Reading [154] and [158] alone might therefore leave the reader uncertain as to whether the tribunal had or had not treated Ms Mitchell&#8217;s conduct at that further meeting as part of the complaint which it upheld.  However, ultimately, at the end of [159], it described the upheld complaint as relating to a course of conduct &#8220;from May 2018 to January 2019.&#8221;  I therefore do not need to prolong this decision by considering Mr Nuttman&#8217;s submissions as to why, in any event, the tribunal could not properly have relied on those later matters in 2019, had it sought to do so.</span></p>
