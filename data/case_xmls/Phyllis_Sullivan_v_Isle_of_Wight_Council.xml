	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This appeal concerns provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (&#8220;ERA&#8221;) which provide that workers have the right not to be subjected to any detriment if they make a protected disclosure, that is a disclosure of certain categories of information to their employer or other specified persons. Regulations may also be made pursuant to section 49B of ERA to confer protection on applicants for posts with National Health Service (&#8220;NHS&#8221;) employers who make protected disclosure. Applicants for other jobs do not have protection if they disclose such information. The issue is whether the legislation is compatible with Article 14, read with Article 10, of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (&#8220;the Convention&#8221;). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In brief, the appellant, Phyllis Sullivan, applied for posts with the respondent, the Isle of Wight Council. She was unsuccessful in her applications. She subsequently sent a letter to her Member of Parliament detailing certain things that she said had occurred at the interviews and complaining about the activities of a charitable trust (one of whose trustees was a member of the interviewing panel). She also made a complaint to the respondent. That complaint was investigated and found to be unsubstantiated. The respondent failed to arrange for the appellant to be given an opportunity for the matter to be referred to another officer for a further review in accordance with the respondent&#8217;s complaints policy. The appellant complained to an employment tribunal that she had been subjected to a detriment &#8211; the refusal to allow a further review of her complaint - because she had made a protected disclosure of information. She accepted that she had not been refused a post because of any disclosure of information as the disclosure occurred after the interviews had been conducted and after she had been told that she had been unsuccessful in her applications.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appellant was not a worker within the meaning of ERA. She was not an applicant for a post with an NHS employer. On the ordinary interpretation of ERA, therefore, she was not entitled to protection in relation to any protected disclosure she made. She contended, however, that the legislation was incompatible with Article 14, read with Article 10, of the Convention, in so far as it protected workers and applicants for NHS posts but not job applicants generally. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The employment tribunal dismissed the claim. It held that the appellant was not in a materially analogous position to workers or applicants for NHS posts. It further held that treatment done on the ground that a person was an applicant for a job was not done on the ground of some &#8220;other status&#8221; for the purposes of Article 14 of the Convention. Finally, it held that any difference in treatment was objectively justifiable. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On appeal, the Employment Appeal Tribunal (&#8220;EAT&#8221;) dismissed the appeal, holding that the appellant was not in a materially analogous position to workers or applicants for NHS posts, and that being an applicant for a job was not a status for the purposes of Article 14 of the Convention. The EAT observed, however, that if it had not dismissed the appeal for those reasons it would have remitted the question of whether the statutory provisions were objectively justifiable to the employment tribunal to enable it to receive evidence on the question of proportionality. The EAT also held that the appeal failed for a different reason. The complaint as presented to the employment tribunal did not concern any detriment imposed as a result of anything connected with the appellant&#8217;s application for employment with the respondent but concerned complaints about alleged financial activities in connection with a charitable trust (which was not connected with the respondent).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The provisions governing the protection of workers who make what are described as protected disclosures of information were first introduced into ERA by the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (&#8220;the 1998 Act&#8221;). They were further amended shortly afterwards by the Employment Relations Act 1999. &#8220;Worker&#8221; was given an extended meaning by section 43K of ERA which, as originally enacted, include those employed under a contract of employment or a contract do any work or perform services personally and certain other categories of worker such as agency workers. A disclosure is a qualifying disclosure if: (a) it involves the disclosure of information which falls within one or more categories of the information specified in section 43B and (b) where disclosure is made to the person or persons specified in sections 43C to 43H of the ERA. The 1998 Act amended other parts of ERA to provide that a worker has the right not to be subjected to any detriment by an employer on the ground that he has made a protected disclosure and to provide that any dismissal would be unfair if the reason, or principal reason, for the dismissal was that the employee had made a protected disclosure. Employment tribunals were given jurisdiction to hear complaints.</p>

It is however unique in a number of ways, It has a very high public and political profile. It is immensely regulated and, whilst the system consists of many theoretically autonomous decision-making units, the NHS as a whole can in effect act as a monopoly when it comes to excluding staff from employment. Further, the political significance of almost everything the system does means that there is often intense pressure to emphasise the positive achievements of the service, sometimes at the expense of admitting its problems.&#8221;</p>

Principles 1 and 2 were concerned with the fostering of a culture of safety and a culture where those who raised honest concerns about safety should be encouraged to speak up. Principle 20 concerned the provision of enhanced legal protection. Two steps were identified. One was to make certain NHS bodies prescribed persons to whom disclosures could be made. The other was to extend the scope of the legislation governing those who make protected disclosures to include students working towards a career in health care. Sir Robert also said this at paragraph 95 of the executive summary to the report:</p>

However I am particularly concerned by one aspect of the legislation, which is that it does nothing to protect people who are seeking employment from discrimination on the grounds that they are known to be a whistleblower. This is an important omission which should be reviewed, at least in respect of the NHS. I invite the Government to review the legislation to extend protection to include discrimination by employers in the NHS, if not more widely, under the Employment Rights Act 1996 or the Equality Act 2010.&#8221;</p>

First, I do not think legislative change can be implemented quickly enough to make a difference to those working in the NHS today. What is needed is a change in the culture and mindset of the NHS so that concerns are welcomed and handled correctly. If this can be achieved, fewer staff will need recourse to the law. Second, this Review is concerned only with the position of disclosures made within one part of the public sector, the NHS. The Act covers all forms of employment whether in the public or private sectors.</p>

The evidence that I have seen during the course of the Review indicates that individuals are suffering, or are at risk of suffering, serious detriments in seeking re-employment in the health service after making a protected disclosure. I am convinced that this can cause serious injustice: they are effectively excluded from the ability to work again in their chosen field. With that in mind, I think that consideration does need to be given to extending discrimination laws to protect those who make a protected disclosure either in the Employment Rights Act 1996 or the Equality Act 2010 or to finding an alternative means to avoid discrimination on these grounds.&#8221;</p>

The appellant also said that she had detected irregularities with a charity, the Shanklin Chine Trust, and that the respondent&#8217;s service and finance manager, Mr Porter, had been associated with the charity for around five years or more. She said the charity had been taking significant public revenues annually but had continually (until recently) been submitting accounts as a dormant company.

However, Ms Shand said that, having given the situation very careful consideration, she had concluded that this would not be an appropriate course of action in the circumstances of this case as a thorough investigation had been undertaken and the process had had a significant impact on the staff involved. Ms Shand considered that it was necessary to take measures to protect the respondent&#8217;s employees from further distress being caused. Accordingly, she said that she was disapplying the option of a stage 2 review in the exceptional circumstances of the case.  The fact that the appellant was not able to seek a further review of her complaint is the detriment to which she says she was subjected because she had made a protected disclosure. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The employment tribunal began its reasons by explaining that it had clarified the issues with the parties. In relation to protected disclosures, it recorded that the appellant accepted that she was not a worker who was entitled to protection under section 47B and 48 of ERA nor was she an applicant for the purposes of section 49B of ERA. Her claim in summary included a claim that sections 47B and 48 ought to be extended to include job applications in the light of, amongst other things, the HRA and Article 14, read with Article 10 of the Convention and having regard to the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Gilham v Ministry of Justice</span> [2019] UKSC 44, [2019] 1 WLR 5905.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The employment tribunal further clarified that the appellant&#8217;s position was as set out in paragraph 18 of its judgment. The only protected disclosure relied upon was the letter to the MP dated 17 March 2020. The conduct referred to in that letter mainly referred to conduct at the interviews but &#8220;also referred to alleged financial irregularities&#8221; and that:</p>

In summary the claimant says that she made a disclosure which in her reasonable belief was in the public interest and tended to show that a manager of the respondent (Mr Porter) had committed a criminal offence (fraud) and/or had breached his legal obligations relating to the financial operation of a charitable trust (the Shanklin Chine Trust) in respect of alleged financial irregularities/the failure to submit truthful accounts of trading revenues to companies House.</p>

In summary, the EAT found that the appellant, as an applicant for a job, was not in a materially analogous position to a worker or an applicant for an NHS post for the purposes of Article 14 of the Convention. In relation to the latter, the EAT had regard to Parliamentary debates on the regulations made under section 49B of ERA.

Whilst having sympathy with Mr Jupp's submission that this particular respondent had made its bed in deciding not to adduce any evidence in that connection, the issue is of significance beyond this litigation and, had the matter been remitted, it would have been appropriate for the Secretary of State to have been invited to consider whether he would like the opportunity to adduce evidence and be heard on the point, as Mr Jupp's submissions in reply acknowledged.&#8221;</p>

It considered that the relevant protected disclosure, as identified at paragraph 18(3) of the employment tribunal&#8217;s reasons, related to alleged financial irregularities at a charity, not matters that arose at interview. That had been the subject of a complaint made in accordance with the respondent&#8217;s general complaints procedure. The EAT concluded that, even if it were wrong about its analysis that the claim did not fall within Article 14 of the Convention, the claim would have been dismissed as the detriment was not suffered in connection with being a job applicant. The EAT said this at paragraph 42:</p>

In this case, as Mr McCombie submitted, it is clear that neither the alleged disclosure nor the treatment of which complaint was made (both of which the tribunal had been at pains to clarify at the outset of the hearing and to record in its reasons) related to the claimant in that capacity. Mr Jupp's reliance upon paras 76 and 77 of the tribunal's reasons is misplaced; both simply summarise the claimant's submissions. The absence of a cross-appeal does not remove the need for careful analysis of the factual premise of the claim and its relevance to the questions to be addressed in this appeal.&#8221;</p>

The legitimate aim of the legislation, as appeared from its long title, was to protect individuals who make certain disclosures of information in the public interest. The suggestion that the aim was linked to workers raising concerns with their employer because they were aware of wrongdoing in their workplace was wrong as the legislation went further than that.  In addition, a less intrusive measure could have been adopted, that is one which protected those who made workplace disclosures without a blanket deprivation of protection for all job applicants (except those applying for jobs with NHS employers). In assessing proportionality, the importance of the issue, namely freedom of expression, was relevant. It would be contrary to the public interest not to provide a remedy for a person who suffered a detriment for making a protected disclosure. The legislation did not strike a fair balance and left job applicants open to detrimental treatment during the recruitment process. </p>

The appellant was in reality a member of the public making a complaint and that was insufficient to amount to a status for the purpose of Article 14 of the Convention. In relation to objective justification, Parliament had specifically limited the protection to workers, including agency workers, and decided to extend it to applicants for posts with NHS employers but not to job applicants more generally. Given that Parliament had specifically made those legislative choices, it could not be said that the legislation had a disproportionate effect.</p>

Mr Moretto, for the Secretary of State, submitted that the aim of the legislation appeared from its wording. The aim was to protect the public. It did so by focussing on those who were in work, and likely to have access to information evidencing wrongdoing or a threat to health and safety or the environment, and who could bring that information to the attention of the employer (or the person responsible for the conduct). They could then investigate and act upon the information provided. Provided the worker made the disclosure in those circumstances, he would be protected. Further, the power to make regulations governing protected disclosure by those applying for posts in the NHS was intended to address a specific problem that had been identified in relation to those seeking work in the health service.</p>

The legislation protected those in the workforce in order to enable them to raise concerns in a responsible way that was consistent with their duties to their employer. Applicants were in a different position. Similarly, job applicants generally were not in an analogous position to applicants for posts with NHS employers. The legislation was intended to ensure that concerns about patient safety were raised and reflected the structure of the NHS which was a national service albeit one where the employers within the service were often legally distinct entities. Further, the fact that a person had done something, such as applying for a job, did not amount to a status for the purpose of Article 14 of the Convention.</p>

This case involved primary legislation enacted by Parliament, and amended from time to time, and where Parliament had made specific choices as to the extent of the protection to be provided. The legislation pursued a legitimate aim, namely protection of the public by giving workers who are aware of wrongdoing and raise concerns internally with their employer protection from being subjected to detrimental action by their employer. The legislation had been amended to apply to applicants for jobs with NHS employers in order to address a specific concern about ensuring patient safety. It was proportionate for the legislation to be drafted in that way.</p>

The legislation confers protection for certain groups of persons who make protected disclosures but not for others. In particular, the legislation as originally enacted protected workers who disclosed certain types of information in certain specified ways. Where a worker  makes a protected disclosure, he is not to be subjected to a detriment by his employer (or another worker of the employer). The legislation did not protect applicants for jobs, that is people who were not workers and did not have a contractual relationship such as a contract of employment or contract to provide work or services. The legislation was amended to extend the protection to one group, those applying for posts with NHS employers. The legislation did not extend the protection to applicants for jobs other than those in the NHS. The question is whether those differences in treatment are compatible with Article 14, read with Article 10, of the Convention.</p>

The legislation is aimed at disclosures by those in work. Applicants for jobs are not in a relevantly similar or analogous position.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Similarly the appellant is not in a materially analogous position to applicants for jobs with NHS employers. The amendments to ERA were aimed at dealing with what was seen as a specific and urgent problem, namely the need to ensure a culture where staff in the health service would be able to make protected disclosures about matters concerning patient safety and treatment. The NHS is a national service albeit one where different legal bodies or entities provide services. The aim was to ensure that persons would not be deterred from making protected disclosures because they may wish to move from one NHS body to another. It is true that the legislation, as a matter of interpretation, confers protection on persons who have never worked for an NHS body but who have made a protected disclosure and then applied for a post with an NHS employer. The thrust of the legislation, however, is to protect patient safety and care by ensuring that those in the health service who have access to information relevant to those issues, and who disclose information about such matters, are not then prevented from accessing other posts in the health service. Applicants for jobs in areas other than the health service are not in a materially or relevantly analogous position. The particular and urgent concern about the need to safeguard patient safety that arose in relation to the health service, and to ensure that those who disclose information relevant to those issues are not subsequently disadvantaged in the NHS recruitment process, does not apply to applicants for jobs in other sectors.</p>

The Supreme Court adopted a similar approach in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Stott) v Secretary of State for Justice</span> [2018] UKSC 59, [2020] AC 51, where Lady Black, with whom Lord Hodge and Lord Mance agreed, said that a generous but not unlimited meaning ought to be given to &#8220;other status&#8221;, that the test of personal characteristics by which persons or groups were distinguishable from each other should be applied, that the personal characteristics need not be innate and the fact that a characteristic was a matter of personal choice did not rule it out as a possible &#8220;other status&#8221; (See paragraphs 56 and 63 and see also per Baroness Hale at paragraph 209).

In this case, the appropriate approach to the question of justification is that set out by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">SC</span>. That case concerned the provision of welfare benefits but the judgment of Lord Reed, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, makes it clear that the approach set out applies to &#8220;legislation in relation to general measures of economic and social strategy&#8221;.

That material may include background material such as explanatory notes to legislation, or government white papers or reports leading to the adoption of legislation. If relevant background information is provided by a minister or other member of either House in the course of debate in Parliament, that information may be taken into account in identifying the problem that Parliament was addressing. The courts must take considerable care, however, when considering statements made in Parliament for the reasons given by Lord Nicholls in <span style="font-style:italic">Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No.2)</span> [2003] UKHL 40, [2004] 1 AC 816 at paragraphs 61 to 67, and by Lord Reed in <span style="font-style:italic">SC</span>, especially at paragraphs 32, 167 and 172 to 174.

However, these grounds form a somewhat inexact category, which has developed in the case law over time, and is capable of further development by the European court. Furthermore, a much less intense review may be applied even in relation to some so-called suspect grounds where other factors are present which render a strict approach inappropriate, as some of the cases to be discussed will demonstrate.&#8221;</p>

Another factor which may be relevant is whether Parliament can be taken to have made its own judgment of the issues which are relevant to the court's assessment.

In order to decide that question, however, the courts usually need to decide whether the legislation strikes a reasonable balance between competing interests, or, where the legislation is challenged as discriminatory, whether the difference in treatment has a reasonable justification. If it can be inferred that Parliament formed a judgment that the legislation was appropriate notwithstanding its potential impact upon interests protected by Convention rights, then that may be a relevant factor in the court's assessment, because of the respect which the court will accord to the view of the legislature. If, on the other hand, there is no indication that the issue was considered by Parliament, then that factor will be absent. That absence will not count against upholding the compatibility of the measure: the courts will simply have to consider the issue without that factor being present, but nevertheless paying appropriate respect to the will of Parliament as expressed in the legislation. </p>

First, the courts should go no further than ascertaining whether matters relevant to compatibility were raised during the legislative process, if they are to avoid assessing the adequacy or cogency of Parliament's consideration of them, contrary to Lord Nicholls&#8217; third principle (in my numbering: para 176 above). The distinction between determining whether, as a question of historical fact, an issue was before Parliament, on the one hand, and determining the cogency of Parliament's evaluation of that issue, on the other hand, is real and must be respected. Undertaking a critical assessment of Parliamentary debates would be contrary to both authority and statute. Furthermore, as I have explained at paras 167&#8211;171 above, it would mistake the nature of Parliamentary processes, and create a risk that the courts might undermine Parliament's effectiveness. Trawling through debates should not, therefore, be necessary, and is unlikely to be appropriate: a high level review of whether a topic was raised before Parliament, whether in debate or otherwise, should suffice.</p>

In order to address the problem that Parliament seeks to remedy, Parliament will identify which groups of people, and in which circumstances, will have protection provided to them or rights or benefits conferred upon them.  That necessarily means that others not in those groups will not have those protections or will not enjoy those rights or benefits. It is inherent in the legislative process that such distinctions have to be drawn (see generally the discussion at paragraphs 161 to 162 in <span style="font-style:italic">SC</span>). It is also right to bear in mind that Parliament may legitimately consider that a particular problem, or a problem which affects one sector of society, needs to be addressed by way of legislation, possibly as a matter of urgency, even if other groups consider that they too are deserving of similar action. The fact that Parliament has chosen to legislate for one particular set of circumstances is unlikely, of itself, to demonstrate any lack of objective justification for the legislation that is adopted. </p>

Further, the legislation required that the protected disclosure be made in accordance with the provisions of ERA. That required the worker to disclose the information to the employer (or the person reasonably believed to be responsible for the conduct) or, subject to further strict requirements, to other persons. If those requirements were satisfied, the worker would be protected from being subjected to a detriment, or being dismissed (see sections 47B and 103A of ERA).</p>

It is legitimate to use statements made in debate as a source of background material indicating the problem, or mischief, that Parliament was addressing. The bill was a private members bill, not a government measure. When introducing the bill into the upper House, Lord Borrie said this:</p>

This culture which encourages decent ordinary citizens to turn a blind eye when then suspect serious malpractice in their workplace, has not only cost lives and ruined livelihoods, but it has damaged public confidence in some of the very organisations on which we all depend.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I deal next with the purpose of the legislation which introduced Part 5A and provided a power for the Secretary of State to make regulations giving protection to applicants for jobs with NHS employers who had made protected disclosure. The background material, in particular the report of Sir Robert Francis QC, identifies the &#8220;mischief&#8221; or problem which Parliament was addressing. The problem was seen to be ensuring that those in the health service were able to express concerns about matters concerning patient safety and the quality of treatment within the health service. A particular feature of the health service is that it is a national service, but one where the bodies or entities providing services in different parts of England, or specialist services, are legally separate. Staff are employed by different bodies within the health service. Persons who had made disclosures to one NHS employer could have difficulty in transferring to another NHS employer in what the report described as a system where, whilst it &#8220;consists of many theoretically autonomous decision-making units, the NHS as a whole can in effect act as a monopoly when it comes to excluding staff from employment&#8221; (see paragraph 8 of the executive summary of the report cited in full above).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Against that background, the purpose, or aim, of the relevant legislative provisions appears clearly from the wording of section 49B of ERA. It provides power to the Secretary of State to make regulations &#8220;prohibiting an NHS employer from discriminating against an applicant because it appears to the NHS employer that the applicant has made a protected disclosure&#8221;. A protected disclosure has the meaning given by section 43A (see section 235 of ERA). The section defines an applicant as a person applying to an NHS employer for a contract of employment, a contract to do work personally, or an appointment to an office or post. An NHS public body is defined in section 49B(7) and includes those bodies within the health service who provide, or arrange for the provision of, services. Section 49B(6) provides that an NHS employer is an NHS public body prescribed by regulations made under the section. In other words, the section is concerned with the protection of those applying for work or posts in the NHS as a whole who have made a protected disclosure, i.e. have previously disclosed information in a responsible way as provided for in the legislation.</p>

First, the ground for the difference in treatment in the present case is not a suspect ground, that is, it is not one of the grounds which, in principle, require weighty reasons by way of justification. The difference in treatment here is based on whether a person is a worker, or an applicant for work or a post in the NHS, as compared with a person who is a job applicant more generally. Treatment based on whether a person is an applicant for work (other than in the health service) is not treatment on one of the &#8220;suspect&#8221; or core grounds with which Article 14 of the Convention is concerned. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, it is important to bear in mind that Parliament has expressly considered matters relevant to the issue of compatibility in the present case. It is implicit in the wording of the legislation enacted in 1998 that Parliament considered that the wider public interest justified giving a degree of protection, in certain circumstances, to workers but not to applicants for work. It is implicit in the legislation empowering the making of regulations to protect those seeking posts in the NHS that Parliament considered that there was a need to protect applicants seeking work in the national health service but not job applicants more generally.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter is put beyond doubt by the fact that, in 2015, Parliament did expressly consider a proposed amendment to section 43K of ERA which would have extended protection to a person who &#8220;is or has been a job applicant&#8221;. Parliament debated and rejected the proposed amendment. Parliament thereafter legislated to provide for the making of regulations in relation to job applicants in the NHS sector who had made a protected disclosure. Parliament has, therefore, weighed the competing interests of the wider community in encouraging disclosure of information, the interests of workers, applicants for posts in the NHS, and job applicants more widely. The courts are entitled to take into account the fact that Parliament has specifically debated a relevant issue. It is not appropriate to seek to analyse the cogency of Parliament&#8217;s consideration of the issue for the reasons explained by Lord Reed at paragraph 183 of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">SC</span>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Lord Reed observed at paragraphs 180 of his judgment (set out above) among relevant factors in assessing proportionality are the subject-matter of the legislation, whether it is relatively recent or dates from an age with different values and whether Parliament can be taken to have made its own assessment on the issues which are relevant to the court&#8217;s assessment. Here, the subject matter is one concerning social policy. The legislation is recent, first enacted in 1998 and the specific amendment relating to job applicants was debated and voted on in 2015. It is clear that Parliament implicitly in 1998 and explicitly in 2015 considered whether the legislation should be extended to protect job applicants generally and decided that it should not. In those circumstances, the courts are likely to give substantial weight to the judgment made by Parliament. As Lord Reed put it at paragraph 180 in <span style="font-style:italic">SC</span> &#8220;the court will be more inclined to accept Parliament&#8217;s decision&#8221;. Or, as Baroness Hale recognised in paragraph 35 of her decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Gilham</span>, the &#8220;courts will always, of course, recognise that sometimes difficult choices have to be made between the rights of the individual and the needs of society and that they may have to defer to the considered opinion of the elected decision-maker&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the circumstances, therefore, a reasonable relationship of proportionality has been demonstrated to exist between the purpose or aim of the relevant legislative provisions and the means adopted to achieve that aim. The purpose is to protect the public interest by ensuring that certain groups can disclose information about wrongdoing or threats to health or safety or the environment. The method of achieving that is to protect workers who make protected disclosures and those applying for work in the NHS. Legislation has also been enacted, but is not yet in force dealing with the protection of applicants for children&#8217;s social care positions. Parliament has not (or not yet) considered it appropriate to extend protection to other groups such as applicants for jobs more generally. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Against that background, it is possible to consider the arguments of the appellant, and the second intervener, relatively briefly. Much of the focus in submissions was that, on a detailed consideration of the legislative provisions, it might be possible to find instances where people not in the workplace made a disclosure (because they had been employed but not yet taken up work or they had left the employer) or because it is theoretically possible that a worker could make a protected disclosure about things occurring otherwise than in his workplace, and still enjoy protection. In relation to the protection for job applicants seeking work from an NHS employer, it is said that this could extend to those seeking work in finance or accounting sectors of the NHS which would not necessarily be concerned with patient safety. Further, the protection could extend to someone who had never worked in the NHS, had made a protected disclosure and then sought to work in the NHS. It was said, therefore that it could not be objectively justified to exclude protection from others such as job applicants more generally.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_93">
	  <num>93.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That approach, however, does not assist. It fails to recognise the fact that legislation necessarily has to differentiate between groups of people. Legislation by its nature operates by identifying which groups, in which circumstances, are to enjoy protection. The fact that legislation could, in theory, extend to some cases which could be said to be on the periphery of, or fall outside, the core purpose of the legislation does not mean that the legislation lacks objective justification. Still less does it mean that the legislation must be made to extend to whole groups of people to whom Parliament does not intend the legislation to apply, in order for the legislation to avoid being stigmatised as incompatible with Article 14 of the Convention. In truth, such a form of reasoning discredits the important purpose underlying Article 14. That Article seeks to prohibit unjustified discrimination on certain grounds. In the case of some grounds, such as those specified in Article 14 like race or sex, courts will naturally and instinctively be concerned to ensure that there is a proper basis for distinguishing between people for such reasons. However, Article 14 and the concept of differential treatment on grounds of status has been applied to a far broader range of circumstances. Courts need to be equally astute to ensure that challenges to legislation do not become a means of arguing for a particular policy outcome under the guise of challenges to differences in treatment resulting from primary legislation adopted by a democratically elected legislature.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Similarly, the legislature may consider that a particular problem has been identified, or that a particular urgency exists. The fact that the legislature deals immediately with that problem, but does not address other problems that (some consider) may be analogous does not mean that the legislation lacks objective justification. That would be to force Parliament to legislate to achieve more than it considers necessary or appropriate. In the present case, for example, Parliament decided that there was a need to deal with the problem of disclosure of information in the health service which affected patient safety or treatment. An urgent need for action had been identified and the structure of the NHS as a national service operating through different legal entities called, in the judgment of Parliament, for legislation giving protection to applicants for work or posts in the NHS sector. To suggest that Parliament could not legislate to address that problem without simultaneously addressing the position of job applicants in other sectors would be to constrain the legislature. Parliament would be forced to do more than it considered it needed to do to address a problem &#8211; or it would have to leave the identified problem unresolved. The prohibition on unjustified differential treatment in Article 14 of the Convention was not intended to constrain or restrict the legislature in that way.</p>

Here, the question that the court is considering is whether provisions of primary legislation are incompatible with Article 14 of the Convention. It is difficult to believe that a different answer to that question should follow if the court uses one set of words rather than another set of words when considering that question.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The way in which the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">SC</span> actually decided the issues in the case was as follows. It decided that legislation restricting the payment of welfare benefits in the form of tax credits to families with two children did amount to discrimination against women. The aims were to reduce public spending on welfare benefits and to address the unfairness arising from the system and the imposition of an unreasonable burden on those taxpayers paying for the scheme. Those aims were legitimate (see paragraphs 190 to 192 of <span style="font-style:italic;color:#3D3D3D">SC</span>). "Parliament had decided that the objectives being pursued by the measure justified its enactment, notwithstanding its greater impact on women" and in those circumstances, the Supreme Court saw no basis on which it could properly take a different view (see paragraph 199 of <span style="font-style:italic;color:#3D3D3D">SC</span>). Similarly, in relation to the claim that the legislation discriminated against children living in households with more than two children, the assessment of proportionality "ultimately resolves into the question of whether Parliament made the right judgment" and there was "was no basis, consistent with the separation of powers under our constitution, on which the courts could properly overturn Parliament's judgment that the measure was an appropriate means of achieving its aims" (see paragraphs 208 and 209 of <span style="font-style:italic;color:#3D3D3D">SC</span> ). The Supreme Court did not consider that it was necessary to go through the three- or four-stage analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">Bank Mellat</span> or other cases. In my judgment, it is appropriate to take the same approach in the present case. The legislation pursues a legitimate aim and the means adopted are an appropriate and not disproportionate means of achieving those aims. The difference in treatment that results is objectively justified.</p>

The measures adopted to achieve that legislative objective are rationally connected with it. The means used are no more than is necessary to achieve that aim. In that regard, I reject the submission of the appellant that it was not necessary to adopt legislation which, as it was put, denied protection to job applicants. That is to distort the nature of the legislative measures adopted. Parliament decided to protect of workers and applicants for jobs or posts in the health service who make protected disclosures. It adopted legislation which was designed to achieve that end. What the appellant seeks to do is to extend protection for other groups. Finally, the legislation does strike a fair balance between the wider public interest, the interests of workers and those seeking work in the health service, those seeking work in other sectors, and employers. </p>

First, there was discussion as to who bore the burden of proving that the difference in treatment was objectively justified. In truth, questions of the burden and standard of proof are rarely, if ever, going to assist or be determinative of the question of whether primary legislation pursues a legitimate aim and whether the means adopted to achieve that aim are proportionate. Strictly, if the subject matter falls within the scope of Article 14 and if it is shown that legislation gives rise to differential treatment between persons in a materially analogous situation on one of the grounds set out in Article 14, then the person asserting that the difference in treatment is objectively justifiable bears the burden of proving that. In practical terms, if the question arises in an employment tribunal, it will often be the employer who will be seeking to rely on the legislation as justifying the differential treatment. </p>

In theory, the employer could seek to rely on the legislation by reference to its terms and any relevant aid to interpretation.  In practice, however, the government department which sponsored the legislation (or, as here, is responsible for employment legislation generally) is likely to have the greatest interest in, and knowledge of, or ready access to, relevant aids to interpretation. An employment tribunal can invite the government department to intervene. That should not normally be necessary and government departments should not routinely be invited to take part in litigation in the employment tribunal where a claimant asserts that legislation gives rise to differential treatment contrary to Article 14 of the Convention read with some other article. Similarly, the EAT can invite the relevant government department to intervene.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Next, the issue arose as to whether the employment tribunal and the EAT were correct to conclude that the relevant provisions of ERA could not be read down so that they applied to applicants for jobs generally. It is not necessary to decide this as the relevant legislative provisions are compatible with the Convention. It is only necessary to consider section 3 of the HRA if, applying the recognised principles of interpretation, legislation would be incompatible with a Convention right. Only then does any question of interpreting the legislation differently arise. That is not the case here. For completeness, however, I note that in my view it would not be possible to interpret the provisions of Part IVA of ERA, and in particular sections 43K or 49B, differently. It is clear that Parliament has taken a considered decision to limit the scope of the protection available to workers and applicants for work or posts with an NHS employer. It would not be possible to interpret the relevant sections as applying to job applicants generally without cutting across a basic feature of the legislation. Were the provisions of section 43K or 49B to be incompatible with Article 14, read with Article 10 (which is not the case), then the appropriate remedy would have been to grant a declaration that the provision or provisions were incompatible with Article 14, read with Article 10, of the Convention pursuant to section 4 of the HRA.</p>

Paragraph 18 is the clarification. Paragraph 18(2) notes that the appellant&#8217;s letter to the MP dealt with the interview but &#8220;also referred to alleged financial irregularities&#8221;. Paragraph 18(3) makes it clear what the appellant&#8217;s case was. It was (as set out in her particulars of claim) that a manager of the respondent had allegedly committed a criminal offence (fraud) or had breached his legal obligations relating to the financial operation of a charitable trust (the Shanklin Chine Trust). The paragraph read fairly, and as a whole, does not, as Mr Jupp submitted, expand the claim to include both the alleged financial irregularities and alleged breaches of disability discrimination legislation. Rather, in my view, on a fair reading, it confirms the scope of the claim as set out in the particulars of claim. The claim was that the appellant had suffered a detriment by not being allowed to pursue her complaint because she had made a protected disclosure about alleged financial irregularities at a charitable trust. That was a complaint made as a member of the public. It is not made in connection with the fact that she had applied for a job with the applicant. The appellant&#8217;s claim to the employment tribunal was not a claim that she had been subjected to a detriment in her capacity as a job applicant, or in any way connected with putative employment with the respondent.

The appellant, as an applicant for a job, is not in a materially analogous position to workers, or applicants for work or posts with NHS employers. The legislation pursues a legitimate aim and the means adopted to achieve that aim are appropriate and not disproportionate. Any difference in treatment which results from the provisions of the legislation is objectively justified. I would dismiss this appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree that this appeal should be dismissed.  As is so often the case in claims based on article 14 of the Convention, the issues of analogous position, status and objective justification overlap.  In this case I find it most helpful to focus on objective justification.  For the reasons given by Lewis LJ at paras. 74-101 of his judgment I believe that the differences of treatment between (to put it broadly) non-NHS applicants for employment on the one hand and workers and NHS applicants on the other do represent a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate end, even if they are to be treated as being in an analogous position.  I particularly agree with Lewis LJ&#8217;s emphasis on the need for the courts to respect the choices made by Parliament in the context of primary legislation of this kind.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I also respectfully agree with Lewis LJ&#8217;s observations in paras. 102-104 above.  As he says, it should usually be possible for the ET, and often the EAT, to deal with questions of the Convention-compatibility of legislation without inviting an intervention from the relevant Minister; but there will be rare cases (perhaps less rare in the case of secondary legislation) where that is an appropriate course.  </p>
