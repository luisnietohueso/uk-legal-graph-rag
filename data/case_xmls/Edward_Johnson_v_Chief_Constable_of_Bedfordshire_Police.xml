	    <p class="Style1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the hearing of the application of the Claimant by notice dated 20 November 2024 seeking an anonymity order, anonymisation of details contained in any papers already filed in these proceedings, restrictions relating to access to the Court file, and reporting restrictions. The application was cast in terms which sought determination by a Master either at a 30 minute hearing, or, if the Master considered this appropriate, without a hearing. However, by Order dated 27 November 2024, Master Thornett directed that it should be released to a Judge of the Media and Communications List, and gave directions to enable an effective hearing to take place on a date convenient to Counsel for both parties on the first available date after 20 January 2025. Before me, Ms Grossman appeared for the Claimant and Mr Bedloe appeared for the Defendant, and I am grateful to both of them for their clear and helpful submissions.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Style1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It appears that the reference to &#8220;CPR 39.3 (a), (c) and/or (g)&#8221; is a mistake, and that what was intended was reference to CPR 39.2(3) (a), (c) and/or (g). The latter provisions are relied upon by Ms Grossman in her Skeleton Argument. However, even if that was the intention, it is misguided. CPR 39.2(3) sets out the grounds upon which the Court may decide to hold a hearing in private, which include &#8220;(a) publicity would defeat the object of the hearing&#8221;, &#8220;(c) it involves confidential information (including information relating to personal financial matters) and publicity would damage that confidentiality&#8221;, and &#8220;(g) the court for any other reason considers this to be necessary to secure the proper administration of justice&#8221;. Although such factors may play a part in deciding whether to grant an anonymity order, whether or not the hearing is held in private is a separate matter from the grant of anonymity. Moreover, and notwithstanding that (1) the names of the parties were set out when the case was listed for the hearing before me, and (2) those names were also stated on the notice posted outside the courtroom, in the present case the Claimant made no application for the hearing to be held in private. Nor, indeed, did the Claimant apply for any other form of hearing protection, such as an order restricting or prohibiting the use of documents that were read to or by the court, or referred to, at this public hearing (see CPR 21.22).</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Style1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The only immediate application made by Ms Grossman was one made at the end of the hearing, and concerned a request for a reporting restriction to be imposed in relation to one specific mental health matter. This was not resisted by Mr Bedloe, and I considered it right to accede to it. In doing so, I had well in mind the comprehensive survey of this area of the law by Nicklin J in his recent judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">PMC v A Healthcare Board</span> [2024] EWHC 2969 (KB) (<span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;PMC&#8221;</span>), and of his firm conclusion (see [51] and [124]) that a statutory jurisdiction is needed for the imposition of any reporting restriction, essentially because, as Lord Sumption explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Khuja v Times Newspapers Ltd </span>[2019] AC 161 at [18]: &#8220;The inherent power of the court at common law to sit in private or anonymise material deployed in open court has never extended to imposing reporting restrictions on what happens in open court. Any power to do that must be found in legislation&#8221;. I also had well in mind that in <span style="font-style:italic">Tickle &amp; Anor v The BBC &amp; Ors </span>[2025] EWCA Civ 42, Sir Geoffrey Vos MR said at [78]: &#8220;Courts operate on the basis of the law and the evidence, not on the basis of judicial speculation and anecdote, even if it is legitimate to take judicial notice of some matters&#8221;.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Style1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my opinion, however, the dividing line between the court&#8217;s general power to control its own proceedings, which it is accepted may result in some information not being available to be reported (see <span style="font-style:italic">Khuja </span>at [16]), and a restriction on reporting what has been seen and heard in open court, which adds the extra dimension of &#8220;press censorship&#8221; (see <span style="font-style:italic">ibid</span>), is not a sharp one when, as sometimes happens, a hearing is conducted in open court on the basis that there is no necessity for it, or any part of it, to be heard in private, provided that care is taken not to mention in open court particular information that is of notable sensitivity and that is of no or at best highly peripheral relevance to the issues in the case, and that information is nevertheless mentioned in open court. In such circumstances, real injustice could result if the Court was powerless to act, or declined to act, by preventing the information from being further disseminated, and, in my experience, judges have not hesitated to grant protection of that kind. In the present case, at least at this stage of the proceedings, this specific mental health information is not necessary for an understanding of the matters that are in issue, attracts as a starting point a high level of confidentiality, and is not of any legitimate interest for the media to report or for the public to be told. For these reasons, I do not consider that I was powerless, or wrong, to make the order sought.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Style1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of more apparent relevance to the Claimant&#8217;s substantive application is CPR 39.2(4), which provides: &#8220;The court must order that the identity of any person shall not be disclosed if, and only if, it considers non-disclosure necessary to secure the proper administration of justice and in order to protect the interests of that person&#8221;. CPR 39.2(4), together with other provisions, was referred to in the draft Order accompanying the Claimant&#8217;s application notice. In <span style="font-style:italic">PMC, </span>Nicklin J observed at [69]: &#8220;The terms of this rule closely mirror the established bases on which the Court is justified in granting any derogation from open justice, as explained in the earlier parts of this judgment&#8221;. The reference to &#8220;earlier parts&#8221; of that judgment is a reference, in particular, to [34]-[37], in which Nicklin J said that the two principal grounds on which derogations from open justice could be justified as necessary were (1) maintenance of the administration of justice and (2) the protection of other legitimate interests. At the same time, Nicklin J held that anonymity orders fall into two classes, namely (i) those that involve the withholding of a name and (ii) those that prohibit publication of the withheld information or any other information that would be likely to identify the person the Court has directed should be anonymised (see [45]). Nicklin J further held that the power to make the first class of order is to be found in rules other than CPR 39.2(4) and in the general power of the Court to control its own proceedings, and that the power to make the second class of order is to be found in &#8220;the regime for reporting restrictions provided under various statutes&#8221; (see [73]). </p>

	    <p class="Style1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the present case, if the Claimant establishes that it is appropriate for the Court to make an order falling within the first class (which the Court clearly has jurisdiction to do, although in accordance with Nicklin J&#8217;s analysis not one that derives from CPR 39.2(4)), there would be no difficulty in establishing jurisdiction to make the second class of order, if appropriate.

	    <p class="Style1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings were commenced by a Claim Form dated 31 July 2020, which has not been served on the Defendant, and which was not before the Court. The immediate reason for this (on the face of it, extraordinary) lack of progress is that a series of extensions of time were agreed between the Claimant and the Defendant. Before the last of those agreed extensions expired on 1 December 2024, however, the Defendant indicated that it would not agree a further extension. This prompted the issue of the Claimant&#8217;s application dated 20 November 2024. This originally sought, on an urgent basis, and in addition to various derogations from open justice, an extension of time for service of the Claim Form and Particulars of Claim, partly on the ground that the Claimant is funded by Legal Aid and it was necessary to obtain the approval of the Legal Aid Agency to a High Costs Case Plan before the claim could be progressed.

	    <p class="Style1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant is named on the Claim Form. From what Ms Grossman told the Court, however, the Claimant&#8217;s legal advisers always had it in mind to seek an anonymity order at what they considered to be the appropriate time, namely at or before the time of service of the Claim Form. In their view, there was no need to seek such an order earlier, on the footing that the Claim Form would not become available for inspection by any non-party until after it had been served, and an acknowledgment of service had also been served. This explains the timing of the application dated 20 November 2024. The intention to seek such an order was not communicated to the Defendant until 12 November 2024. The Claimant&#8217;s legal advisers saw no need to do this earlier, and they are constrained by Legal Aid funding to limit their costs to what is necessary.</p>

The filming took place during a police raid (by the Defendant&#8217;s officers) of the Claimant&#8217;s home on 7 August 2019. The Claimant&#8217;s father was arrested during that operation. His brother was also arrested in a separate operation which took place elsewhere. The Claimant himself was never of any interest to the police. Neither he nor his parents (in the house at the time) gave informed consent to the film crew filming. The Claimant was under the impression the film crew were police evidence gatherers, and only became aware that they were in fact filming for a television programme after the event.&#8221;</p>

The evidence before the Court (see [13] of Mr Bahra&#8217;s witness statement) is that these proceedings continue to be pursued by the Crown Prosecution Service but have yet to come to trial, partly as a result of a general backlog in the criminal courts, and partly because of the serious ill health of the Claimant&#8217;s father. </p>

Nevertheless, it appeared to be common ground before me that no trial has yet taken place. Further, no details were available as to whether and to what extent the criminal proceedings have been the subject of hearings in open court. However, I regard it as inconceivable that during the four or more years that they have been in existence they have not been the subject of a number of such hearings: matters such as bail, pleas, case management, directions, and adjournments have to be considered in every case, and all such matters are dealt with in open court unless exceptional reasons apply.  </p>

It is only of relevance by way of background, in so far as it bears on the question of why the proceedings have taken the protracted course that they have. The position of the Claimant&#8217;s solicitors is that it was necessary to understand whether the agreement in some way operated as a barrier to the Claimant&#8217;s prospects of success as against the Defendant, because that was relevant to an assessment of how the claim should proceed. This required to be made as the costs to the Legal Aid Agency are now expected to exceed &#163;25,000, such that a High Costs Case Plan needed to be submitted to and agreed with the Legal Aid Agency.</p>

He has also been assured that no decision would be taken as to whether the Incident would be included in a future episode until the conclusion of the criminal trial of his father and brother (the &#8216;Criminal Proceedings&#8217;). We understand that that trial is scheduled for October 2024 and that your client is not the subject of those Criminal Proceedings. Accordingly, an editorial decision has now been taken that your client&#8217;s image or voice will not be featured at all, whether disguised or otherwise, in any potential future episode of the Programme, irrespective of the outcome of the Criminal Proceedings &#8230;</p>

Despite the delay in proceedings against your client&#8217;s father and brother, this investigation has led to a number of substantial prison sentences and the recovery of considerable amounts of Class A drugs and money seized. There is a significant public interest in filming the work of the police and particularly the Serious Organised Crime Unit, which deals with the most serious criminality, as they undertake such a complex investigation into alleged crimes which could have significant impact on the local community.</p>

On 7 August 2019, a two-person TGP crew attended the Property with the Police in order to film the arrest of your client&#8217;s father and the subsequent search of the Property for evidence. These events formed crucial points in the investigation. It was therefore necessary and legitimate for TGP to record these events in the public interest in order to obtain footage which, if broadcast, would give a proper account to the public of the Police&#8217;s investigation into the case, and the nature and gravity of the crimes of which your client&#8217;s father is accused.

After the arrest, the TGP crew turned their attention to filming the search of the Property for evidence. Again, at the earliest reasonable opportunity, the TGP crew provided information in respect of filming to your client&#8217;s mother, explaining that they were part of the Programme team and that they would be following the work of the police. Your client&#8217;s mother also did not raise any concerns with this. At no point did a member of the TGP crew state to your client&#8217;s mother that it was &#8216;part of the police team&#8217; &#8230; Rather, the TGP crew considered that they had made clear that the purpose of filming was for the Programme, and that this had been understood by both of your client&#8217;s parents; they had no intention to nor did they mislead anyone as to the reason for their presence.</p>

Both the judge's decisions expressly turned on whether it was "necessary and proportionate" to grant anonymity. That language clearly reflects a Convention analysis and the balancing process which the judge was required to undertake. The question implicit in the judge's reasoning process is whether the consequences of disclosure would be so serious an interference with the claimant's rights that it was necessary and proportionate to interfere with the ordinary rule of open justice &#8230;</p>

He was considering whether it had been shown that the balance fell in favour of anonymity. The cases all show that this question is not to be answered on the basis of "rival generalities" but instead by a close examination of the weight to be given to the specific rights that are at stake on the facts of the case. That is why "clear and cogent evidence" is needed. This requirement reflects both the older common law authorities and the more modern cases. In <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Scott</span> at p438 Viscount Haldane held that the court had no power to depart from open justice "unless it be strictly necessary"; the applicant "must make out his case strictly, and bring it up to the standard which the underlying principle requires". <span style="font-style:italic">Rai </span>(CA) is authority that the same is true of a case that relies on Article 8.

This is the default position. The Civil Procedure Rules contain provision for mandatory anonymisation in certain circumstances, see CPR 39.2(4). General guidance on anonymising parties or witnesses is given at CPR 39.2.13, and guidance specific to the Court of Appeal is given at CPR 52.23.4. In addition, Practice Guidance dated 22 March 2022 explains the approach to anonymisation of parties to asylum and immigration cases in the Court of Appeal; it provides that the identity of a party is to be withheld only if the court considers it necessary to secure the proper administration of justice and in order to protect the interests of that party (reproduced in the White Book 2024 at CPR 52PG.2, see paragraph 3 in particular). All these rules and sources of guidance emphasise the default position.

Any balance starts with a very clear presumption in favour of open justice unless and until that is displaced and outweighed by a sufficiently countervailing justification.

On that basis, media reporting of this case seems to me likely to be such as will &#8220;contribute to a debate of general interest&#8221; (see <span style="font-style:italic">Von Hannover v Germany&#160;</span>[2005] EHRR 1, at [63]). Accordingly, it is right to attach weight in this instance to the recognition that if a story is of less interest to the media and the public, it is less likely to be reported, or read or viewed by the public who are told about it. Further, the consequences of such filming being allowed for individuals who are not suspects but who are caught up in police investigations and activities is an important aspect of that debate. This is perhaps particularly so if they are vulnerable and thus more liable to suffer harm. Reporting on such consequences without identifying the individuals in question is likely to be difficult, and to lack impact (because it will appear disembodied) even if it can be done.

This&#160;is not just a matter of deference to editorial independence. The judges are recognising that editors know best how to present material in a way that will interest the readers of their particular publication and so help them to absorb the information. A&#160;requirement to report it in some austere, abstract form, devoid of much of its human interest, could well mean that the report would not be read and the information would not be passed on. Ultimately, such an approach could threaten the viability of newspapers and magazines, which can only&#160;inform the public if they attract enough readers and make enough money to survive.</p>

If an individual is unable to ask the Court to prevent publication of a sexual liaison which the individual claims ought not to be made public without being required to reveal in the proceedings both the individual&#8217;s identity and the very liaison the individual is seeking to keep secret, then that would thwart the proper administration of justice. The present case is not such a case. The private information and data which the Claimant is seeking to protect in the present case consists of film footage. Refusal of the derogations he seeks will not have the effect of making that information and data public. If and to the extent that the footage features in the proceedings (eg by way of disclosure or as a result of being deployed at trial) the Court can take steps then, if appropriate, to prevent it from being repeated.</span></p>

The Claimant has not provided a witness statement himself, and although Mr Bahra has made three witness statements on his behalf and a lengthy psychiatric report has also been served on his behalf, none of that evidence alludes to such consequences. Whether or not the Claimant found the events complained of deeply distressing provides no reliable indication as to whether he would find the pursuit of these proceedings materially distressing in the absence of the derogations from open justice that he seeks. Even making due allowance for the costs constraints that he may face in light of the fact that his claim is being funded by Legal Aid, I am not prepared to draw an inference to that effect on the basis of the evidence that he has adduced, in light of the requirement for &#8220;clear and cogent evidence&#8221; that is spelled out in the cases.</span></p>

In my view, however, although guidance is provided in the authorities by reference to the need to determine whether &#8220;non-disclosure is necessary to secure the proper administration of justice and in order to protect the interests of that party or witness&#8221;, the approach to the issues that is adopted in the cases does not reflect an acceptance that those requirements are cumulative. Further, as Nicklin J explained in <span style="font-style:italic">PMC </span>at [34]-[37], the long-standing jurisprudence demonstrates that derogations from open justice can be justified as necessary either to secure the proper administration of justice or to protect other legitimate interests. I therefore approach the present case on the basis, favourable to the Claimant, that it would be sufficient for him to establish either of the requirements in CPR 29.2(4).  </p>

All of that involves some revelation of personal matters of a type which, in the words of Mostyn J, &#8220;people would generally not want bandied about publicly&#8221;. However, these matters constitute the very heart of the Claimant&#8217;s causes of action, and it is absolutely typical that such matters are revealed in cases relying on such causes of action. Indeed, without such matters being revealed claimants cannot obtain public vindication for the wrongs they claim to have suffered. Victims of phone hacking and people who complain about intrusive press photography (including children: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">Murray v Express Newspapers plc </span><span style="color:initial">[2009] Ch 481) are among legion examples. In each case, the fact that the claimant has been subject to the invasion of privacy and loss of autonomy complained of is itself a private matter, but the revelation of that matter in litigation is minor in comparison to the intrusion occasioned by the wrongdoing complained of, for which the claimant is seeking relief (i.e. it is a small price to pay for obtaining redress), and moreover, speaking generally, even if it gives rise to a &#8220;risk of unwanted attention, comment or embarrassment&#8221; that is &#8220;a predictable and acceptable consequence of the open justice principle at work&#8221; (</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">Gardinala</span><span style="color:initial">, Whipple LJ at [11]).   </span></p>

So far as that is concerned, I am unable to accept that anyone who may want to harm the Claimant due to his association with his father and brother will not already have done so over the five or more years since the police raid took place, or would be motivated to do so by learning that he is the claimant in the present case.</p>

It relates instead to the concern that if he is identified as the individual who is making the complaints that form the subject of the present proceedings, the fact that he is the son and brother of two men who are the subject of criminal proceedings (and the brother of a man who has or who is associated with far right-wing views) will attract publicity. </p>

In the words of the test that I was invited to apply by Ms Grossman, a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities placed in the position of such an individual would not take substantial offence at such a connection being publicised.

	    <p class="Style1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems, however, that this view is too robust, at least so far as concerns the revelation that family members are implicated in criminality. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> </span>[2005] 1 AC 593, the House of Lords upheld the refusal of an application for an injunction restraining the publication by newspapers of the identity of a defendant in a murder trial which had been intended to protect the privacy of her son who was not involved in the criminal proceedings. But it did so not on the grounds that Article 8 was not engaged (see Lord Steyn at [24]: &#8220;On the evidence it can readily be accepted that Article 8 is engaged&#8221;, and at [32]: &#8220;The jurisdiction under the ECHR could equally be invoked by an adult non-party faced with possible damaging publicity as a result of a trial of a parent, child or spouse&#8221;) but instead on the basis that the balance between, on the hand, Article 10 and the principle of open justice, and, on the other hand, Article 8, came down in favour of the former. Further, the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Gardinala </span>suggests that the Court of Appeal considered that the fact that if details of the appellant&#8217;s criminal past became known this might cause the appellant and his family embarrassment was a matter to be taken into account when carrying out the balancing exercise, but that this was not a &#8220;sufficient reason&#8221; to depart from the &#8220;default position&#8221; of open justice.

In particular, I consider that (1) the default position of open justice is materially strengthened or enhanced in this particular case because there is a genuine public interest in identifying the Claimant in light of the nature of the claims that he is bringing, the fact that his claims raise important issues that appear not to have been the subject of any previous decided case, and the serious consequences that he says the matters complained of had for him as a vulnerable individual, (2) some of the matters that the Claimant says he should not be required to be identified with comprise no or little more than the elements of his causes of action, there is nothing unusual or untoward about matters of that kind being made public, and if derogations from open justice were needed to protect a claimant&#8217;s Article 8 rights in respect of such matters then derogations would become the norm rather than the exception, (3) the Claimant says that other matters that he should not be required to be identified with will cause him humiliation and embarrassment (on Mr Bahra&#8217;s evidence) or distress (according to Ms Grossman&#8217;s submissions), but that is not a sufficient reason to derogate from open justice for the like considerations as applied in <span style="font-style:italic">Gardinala</span>, and (4) the Claimant&#8217;s reliance on Article 14 does not affect the balance that would otherwise be struck between open justice and Article 10 considerations on the one hand and Article 8 considerations on the other hand, as he has not established on the evidence that refusal of derogations would have any discriminatory effect on him.</p>
