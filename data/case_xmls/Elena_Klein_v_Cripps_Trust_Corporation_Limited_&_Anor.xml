	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my judgment on the claim made by Mrs Elena Klein pursuant to the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 for such financial provision as it would be reasonable for her to receive as the Will of Mr Alexander Klein did not make reasonable provision for her. The First Defendant is the Executor of the Will but also represents (by Order of Cusworth J of 31 January 2025) the interests of the charitable beneficiaries. The Second Defendant is Cydlia Adler the former executrix of the Will, the trustee of trusts &#8216;established&#8217; by the Will, a pecuniary beneficiary and a 10% residuary beneficiary under the Will. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant and the First Defendant have been represented by counsel and solicitors. The Second Defendant has not been present or represented. Her solicitors came off the record in the autumn of 2024. Ms Adler did not participate in a trial held in the Chancery Division in October 2024 in which her claim that she was in fact the beneficial owner of Alexander Klein&#8217;s shares in various companies was dismissed with indemnity costs. A letter was received from a person purporting to be a nephew of Ms Adler in response to and opposing the First Defendant&#8217;s claim to be registered as shareholder in various companies in place of Mr Klein. In that letter it was stated Ms Adler had been unwell in hospital and had only recently returned home. An &#8216;application&#8217; was made to Morgan J sitting in the Urgent Applications Court on 21 February 2025 by a &#8216;nephew&#8217; of Ms Adler seeking the adjournment of this hearing. Morgan J refused that application &#8211; the nephew having no apparent status to make it.  Neither Ms Adler, nor legal representatives or anyone else has attended this hearing. I am quite satisfied that Ms Adler has had notice of the hearing and that there has been more than adequate time for her to participate. Although the &#8216;nephew&#8217; makes some reference to seeking powers of attorney and there is some hinting at her capacity I am quite satisfied that in applying the over-riding objective it is just to undertake this hearing in the absence of Ms Adler. As will become apparent in the course of this judgment it is the actions and inactions of Ms Adler which have contributed in very substantial measure to this hearing only taking place in the run-up to the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> anniversary of Mr Klein&#8217;s death. Any further delay would be very seriously unfair to the Claimant &#8211; and to the Executors and other beneficiaries. The Claimant has lived a hand to mouth existence for nearly 5 years and had had possession proceedings (or the threat arising from an unpaid mortgage) hanging over her and Elliot for most of that period. None of the pecuniary beneficiaries have received a penny nor have any of the worthy charities. Progress to administering and distributing the Estate is imperative. Even now there seems to be a risk of it being &#8216;Jarndyced&#8217; and further delay with all the costs that would bring would only enhance that risk. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> On 25 March 2020 Alexander Klein died aged 87. He left behind his wife of 17 years Elena Klein (then aged 46) and a son Elliot, then aged 12. Although a wealthy man, in his Will which dated back to 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2011 he left his wife &#163;300,000  &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">on the understanding that [C] will no make claim against my estate</span>&#8221; notwithstanding their long marriage and his son the sum of &#163;100,000 to be held on trust by his trustee to be distributed as to 1/3 on his 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday, 1/3 on his 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> birthday and the remainder on his 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. He made numerous other specific bequests including &#163;100,000 to be held on trust for his adult daughter,  &#163;200,000 to Cydlia Adler (the Second Defendant in this case) his long term secretary/business partner, &#163;100,000 to his trustee for charitable purposes and a further &#163;100,000 on discretionary trusts for his relatives, friends and others  and other bequests to relatives  totalling about &#163;179,000  and left the residue as to 10% to Ms Adler and 90% to be held on a discretionary charitable trust with suggested beneficiaries such as Yesodai Hatora School, Ponovitz Yeshiva and orphanages.  Mr Klein (hereafter the Deceased) appointed Ms Adler as his executrix and as his trustee. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Will made no provision for where his wife (hereafter the Claimant) and son would live or for their maintenance, other than the lump sum left to the Claimant. This came as something of a shock to the Claimant. Since his death the Estate has in the following 5 years made only 1 payment to the Claimant &#8211; the sum of &#163;7,500 &#8211; paid pursuant to an order for interim provision made by Moor J in these proceedings. Given the net value of the Estate on the most recent Distribution Account figures (which may be quite unreliable) was &#163;8.18m this seems something of a surprise. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the months following his death the Claimant and her solicitors entered into correspondence with Ms Adler in relation to the Estate and the provision it made for the Claimant and Elliot. Regrettably no progress was made and on 3 March 2021 the Claimant commenced an action for the removal of Ms Adler as the executrix of the Will. Ms Adler resisted this application but on 5 November 2021 Deputy Master Rhys replaced Ms Adler as Executrix with Cripps Trust Corporation Limited (the First Defendant in this case) . Ms Adler was ordered to pay 80% of the Claimant&#8217;s costs; that sum ultimately being assessed at &#163;132,411.20.  The 20% the Claimant was ordered to pay Ms Adler would seem likely to amount to some &#163;10,500. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the action for the removal of Ms Adler, her removal and the costs order might hint at, her approach to administration of the Estate and her obligations as a trustee has been woeful. Whether this is because of deliberate misfeasance, her being overwhelmed by the complexity of the Estate or because of her deteriorating health or a combination of those factors (and perhaps others) I am not in a position to determine and nor is it necessary for me to do so. However, the consequence has been that the administration of the Estate has become extraordinarily complex and protracted. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The documentation which has been provided to Cripps has been inadequate, incomplete and out of date.  Forensic Accountants, Frenkels prepared a report into the probable assets of the companies and their value. Only once this was available and liaison undertaken with HMRC could Cripps even apply for a Grant of Probate which they did on 11 April 2023: over 3 years after the Deceased&#8217;s death and nearly 18 months since the decision on the Removal application. A grant was received in August 2023.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Apart from the matrimonial home the main &#8216;assets&#8217; in the Estate were properties which were held through about 18 limited companies. On the basis of the Frenkel report the value of the shares in those companies would have been in the region of &#163;8m or some 92% of the Estate's value. Initially it appeared 2 companies might also be included but these ultimately turned out to be owned 100% by Ms Adler.  Of the limited companies in the Estate the shareholdings held by the Estate varied from 100% to 50%. Ms Adler had appointed herself a director of some of them (wrongly) and was a director of others. As enquiries were made it appeared many had been struck off the Register for failure to comply with the lodging of returns etc, some purportedly owned properties which they did not, some held properties it was not known they had owned, some had charging orders against properties for unpaid liabilities, some had held hundreds of thousands of pounds in bank accounts but ascertaining what had happened to the funds was difficult to establish. It appears that Ms Adler may have withdrawn significant sums from companies apparently without authority. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">On 20 November 2023 Ms Adler issued a claim in the Chancery division to be the true owner of the Deceased&#8217;s shares in 15 of the companies comprised in the Estate. For 3 companies the Deceased's registered share ownership was 95% of the shares, 1 was 10% and the other 11 were 50%. The hearing of this claim had been listed to take place in early 2024 and as a result of the issuing of Ms Adler&#8217;s claim in the Chancery Division that hearing had to be vacated. Had her claim succeeded the value of the estate would have been dramatically reduced. Ms Adler&#8217;s claim was heard by Chief Master Shuman on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of October 2024. She declared that Ms Adler was absolutely entitled to the issued shares in Parygold Properties Limited and Brongard Limited but that the Deceased was the true beneficial owner of the shares in the other 15 companies claimed by her. She was ordered to pay the Claimant&#8217;s costs including a &#163;100,000 interim payment, and Cripps were authorised to pay these costs out of Ms Adler&#8217;s interests in the Estate. In the course of the judgment Chief Master Shuman noted that Ms Adler&#8217;s position was wholly inconsistent with her position in the Removal proceedings, in which she had filed a summary of the net estate which included all those shareholdings she now claimed and that she had serious doubts about her credibility. </p>

On 23 January 2025 Deputy ICC Judge Frith had acceded to Cripps&#8217; application for Cripps to registered as shareholder in 10 of the companies (I think so they could take steps to appoint directors and proceed with liquidating the property holdings).  Ms Adler was directed in orders made in October and November 2024 to sign a letter of authority to enable Cripps to secure disclosure of bank statements from Barclays. She has not signed the letter of authority and an application has been made and granted under section 39 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 to enable that disclosure to be obtained.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given the problems with the administration of the Estate it was not until 14 March 2023 that the Claimant issued her 1975 Act claim. The application was case managed and evidence was filed by the Claimant and the Defendants. On 31 August 2023 Cripps were granted letters of administration. Matters went on pause then as a result of Ms Adler&#8217;s Chancery claim although on 24 November Moor J made an order for interim provision to the Claimant of &#163;7500 per month. Only one payment has been made in accordance with that interim order; and that was not until December 2024 when Westbridge was liquidated. The trial of the claim in early 2024 was vacated and following the disposal of Ms Adler&#8217;s Chancery claim further directions were given by Arbuthnot J for trial of the 1975 Act claim, resulting in this hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel for the Claimant and for Cripps provided me with an agreed chronology, an essential reading list, position statements and skeleton arguments. The Claimant gave evidence very briefly. I heard submissions from counsel for the Claimant and for Cripps in its representative capacity. I have considered the position of the Second Defendant Ms Adler via her written evidence, although she has not been represented and her evidence has not been tested. Given that fact, her conduct of the litigation and the inconsistent positions she has taken there are of course significant questions about her credibility. Her general position I think would be that the provision in the Will was reasonable, it was what the Deceased intended to provide as being reasonable and that no further provision should be made. However, the outcome to this case does not in my view depend on the credibility of the evidence Ms Adler gives nor does it depend to a great extent on the credibility of the evidence of the Claimant. Many of the key components are free-standing facts. </p>

Apart from some uncertainty as to the full nature of the relationship between the Deceased and Ms Adler down the decades, the reasons for the dispositions to her would likely to be linked to a long-standing loyalty to her. His dispositions to his family and friends need no explanation. The disposal of the residue to charitable causes is also in some sense for obvious reasons, albeit the disparity between the amount provided to the Claimant and his son and daughter and the amount which at face value would be distributed to charitable causes raises as many questions as it answers. </p>

The lump sum provided to the Claimant would have been a bar to them receiving means tested state benefits and would have been exhausted within 12 odd years even if expended at a very modest rate of &#163;30,000 per annum.

However, as he makes clear this is an estimate and is subject to so many potential changes it is little more than an indicative possibility. Possession proceedings have been commenced by the mortgagee of the former matrimonial home and have been adjourned to April 2025 in order to enable Cripps to progress the liquidation of Westbridge which would provide some liquidity which could be put towards the mortgage debt. However as is clear from both the statement of Mr Sikkel and from the submissions made on behalf of Cripps during the course of the hearing, this is no more than an estimate of the gross value.  Cripps have identified a number of the companies where the asset values seem to be more than Frenkel&#8217;s valuation ( &#163;3-4m more possibly) , a number where they would appear to be less and a number where it is still currently hard to establish what their position is as properties appear to be have been sold with little knowledge of whether the proceeds were re-invested or what became of them.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Sikkel&#8217;s statement identifies that at present the liabilities of the estate including costs stand at &#163;1.117m which includes currently unpaid costs of Cripps of &#163;353,587, the mortgage on the FMH of &#163;248,833 and &#163;292,228 IHT.  He says that the examples of the properties which have had interim charging orders made against them suggest there are &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">likely</span> t<span style="font-style:italic">o be unresolved and outstanding issues relating to the properties which will likely have an impact on the value of the estate interest in the companies that own those properties&#8221; </span> Mr Sikkel has identified the immediate next steps in the administration with a focus on 3 companies which the Estate has a majority shareholding in and which are active. The  gross value noted in the Frenkels report of those companies is in the region of  &#163;5.1-5.4m but these are 3 of the companies where the asset values appear to have increased so they may be worth around &#163;6.5m. In another 7 active companies the Estate holds 50% of the shares and these are likely to be subject to applications for just and equitable winding up. Eight companies remain struck off and consideration is being given to whether to apply to restore, which will be informed by better information about asset values currently relevant to them.   Mr Sikkel states that at present the sum of a further &#163;400,000 is identified as a reserve required to meet the immediately forthcoming further costs related to dealing with the Active Majority, Active Non-Majority and Non-Active Limited companies. I asked whether Cripps were able to give even a range of the potential best and worst case scenarios in relation to the further costs of bringing in and distributing the Estate. They were unable to do so given their experience to date but when I said could it be 5 or even 10 times their current contingency they did not demur.</p>

The administration account shows a gross value of &#163;9.1m with liabilities of &#163;409k. The liabilities of the Estate including the mortgage arrears and IHT reduce it to &#163;8.6m.  The current administration expenses due of &#163;423,619 reduce it to &#163;8.178m.  The expected further administration costs at their lowest are &#163;400,000 plus VAT but could be very considerably more; possibly &#163;2-4m &#8211; although I accept that is a wild guess. </p>

It seems more likely that there will be a significant distributable Estate in that the drift of Mr Sikkel&#8217;s evidence tends to point towards the likelihood that the Active Majority Companies will generate perhaps &#163;5-6m gross from the sale of properties and that the administration costs in securing that should not be disproportionately large. The initial costs are only estimated at &#163;90k (plus VAT) but to get to the position where the properties are sold and the money is in Cripps' hands the costs are not evidenced.  As for the Active Non-Majority Companies and the Inactive Companies there appears to be great uncertainty over what if any net contribution they will make to the Estate. It appears to me that the best estimate I can reach at the moment is that the Active Majority Companies will contribute &#163;5m net and that the Former Matrimonial Home with a value of &#163;1m makes the net distributable estate to be not likely less than &#163;6m with the potential for substantially more if the costs of bringing it in do not become disproportionate, and a possibility that the costs of bringing in the assets of the Active Non-Majority Companies and the Inactive companies could not only consume all the asset value held in them but could eat into the more easily obtained value from the Active Majority Companies. </p>

The evidence about Ms Adler both from the Claimant and from Ms Adler herself would suggest that she had been involved for very many years in the Deceased&#8217;s property business. Although the evidence before me does not establish in any defined way how the Deceased&#8217;s wealth increased over the years I think it safe to infer that a very substantial proportion of his wealth had been generated by 2003 and thus that had the parties divorced that there would have been a strong argument for a departure from equality on the basis that the  assets available had been very significantly derived from assets he brought into the marriage. That would have been mitigated by the fact of the long marriage, that those assets had been deployed to maintain the family standard of living by generating an income and that they had converted in part into the former matrimonial home but this would clearly be a case where there would have been significant skirmishing around the extent to which the &#8216;husband&#8217; should get credit for premarital contributions.</p>

It also seems likely that her account of the Deceased&#8217;s reluctance for her to undertake a demanding professional role has acted as a brake on her ability to progress. The last five years have clearly taken a toll as a result of the precarious position in relation to her home, the straitened financial circumstances she has found herself in and the strain of the litigation arising out of her husband&#8217;s death. At age 51 and with a limited CV, with a continuing (albeit reducing) obligation to Elliot, with depression and liver dysfunction and an elderly father now living with her, her prospects for entering the job market as a full-time solicitor seem negligible. Given her desire to work or to volunteer it seems more likely that she will find some modest roles in those fields but with a correspondingly modest and probably fluctuating earning capacity. She has applied for roles and been unsuccessful and it seems (without being too pessimistic from her point of view) it would be more chance than prediction that she should secure paid employment of anything other than the most modest form. Although her skills in Russian may find a new demand in the light of recent international developments this will not seems to me add very much to her earning capacity in the future. It thus seems to me that it is more probable than not that she will only undertake occasional paid work, more likely she will maintain and perhaps expand her volunteering work and thus her earning capacity should be taken at effectively zero. She will continue to derive a rental income from the Southend flat which comes in at &#163;10,000 per annum and she will have benefits of &#163;14,000 for a further year or so. What her benefit position will be thereafter is unknown as some at least may become directly payable to Elliot (the PIP).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Deceased purchased the former matrimonial home at 52 Hendale Avenue in January 2004. Apart from short stays away during holidays or a short separation the Claimant has lived there since. Elliot has lived there his whole life. It is a detached four bedroom two bathroom house with off street parking and a significant garden close to Sunninghill Park [B56]. At times the family had a live-in au pair. Currently the Claimant Elliot and the Claimant&#8217;s father reside in the FMH. Although Elliot may go to university he will no doubt return at holidays and with property prices as they are and with only a modest capital sum from his father and the trend for children to live at home longer due to property prices there seems a strong probability that Elliot could be living at home for 10 more years or so. That being so the Claimant has a need both in practical terms but also in emotional terms for a family home that gives both continuity to her life but also allows her to house herself and her family comfortably. </p>

The quotes provided are from Mr Boyce &#8211; the friendly lender totalled &#163;40,300 for some roof repairs, complete redecoration internally and externally and garden works and the Claimant says the doors, windows (&#163;17,500), window grilles (&#163;3,780) and kitchen need replacing now (no figure given or details why it is required).   I am afraid the quotes seem somewhat sketchy to my eye for such significant sums and the more recent figures for new doors etc are not evidenced. Rates from Facts and Figures 2024/25 would support a daily rate of &#163;500 for such work. The Claimant claims &#163;9,500 per annum for property maintenance which would suggest a worker being present for 3-4 weeks per year which seems excessive although materials would come on top. Doing the best I can with limited evidence I would allow &#163;6,000 per annum for property maintenance which assuming little was done in the year before the Deceased died would give a sum of &#163;36,000 needed now. </p>

It was not a budget of what she or the Deceased had historically spent. Some of that information would not have been available to her as the Deceased seems to have controlled expenditure such as housing related but other aspects such as holidays, clothes, food etc seems to have been dealt with by the Deceased giving the Claimant money. That has not been the subject of evidence.  The Claimant has clearly been living in fairly straightened financial circumstances over the past 5 years; the debt to her energy supplier alone would support that.  Although Ms Proferes did not cross examine the Claimant on her budget (sensibly given the state the Claimant appeared to be in having been coaxed by her team to attend court) I don&#8217;t doubt that it is open to Cripps to question whether the contents of the budget are reasonable.  </p>

Regular trips abroad, regular outings to entertainment at the theatre or ballet and eating out appear to be supported. However there is no evidence that the lifestyle was extravagant in terms of expensive clothes, jewellery, accessories or even extending to private education for Elliot and allowing the house to fall into a degree of disrepair. The fact that even in 2020 the Deceased was running a 13-year old car suggests that whilst they enjoyed the good things in life he was not extravagant and kept his financial cards close to his chest. Whilst therefore I accept the Claimant&#8217;s evidence that they led a reasonably good standard of living I do not think it was extravagant. As the Claimant&#8217;s budget for herself originally came in at &#163;163,000 &#8211; a little below the equivalent gross of the salary of the Lady Chief Justice - that seems to be somewhat on the high side. A closer examination of the elements of the budget would support that conclusion. In the course of submissions Mr Baxter identified a number of elements which fell away.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The main individual beneficiary in terms of specific pecuniary bequests and the residue is Ms Adler. It is to be noted that Ms Adler has not opposed C&#8217;s claim on the basis of her own needs and resources: she has not adduced any evidence of these. In any event, the evidence suggests that she has valuable shareholdings in the Companies, including the Active Majority Companies, the Active Non-Majority Companies and the Inactive Companies. I am aware that one of her properties (185 Regents Park Road) is now being sold for &#163;1,044,000. After the satisfaction of the costs debt which led to the order for sale, the net sum will be in the region of &#163;0.8-0.9m.  Given she has other costs liabilities to the Claimant (&#163;225,000 odd in relation to the Chancery action and any costs ordered in relation to this action) they may substantially reduce that sum if enforcement is sought against it. Alternatively and as ordered by Chief Master Shuman her interest under the Will may be re-deployed to meet the costs liabilities she has incurred to the Claimant.  Given what she says in her own statements about her involvement in property investment it seems likely that she has extensive other financial resources available to her.  From what we know of her current health and age it seems probable that her needs are limited in length although none ascertainable in extent. She is in her 80s and has had serious illness leading to a three-week stay in hospital. The evidence supports the conclusion that she has the financial resources to meet her needs independently of any interest she might acquire from the Will.</p>

Not only did C not receive legal advice but her English was insufficient for her to understand the documents in any event. Ms Adler disputes the level of the Claimant's knowledge of English and her understanding of the documents but in all the circumstances the &#8216;Agreements&#8217; do not in my view carry any weight in the determination of the claim. The Deceased had exited his 2nd marriage in divorce it would seem and perhaps that motivated his concern to protect his hard-earned assets. In any event he subsequently acted against those agreements by gifting the Claimant a property and by making provision for her in his Will. The fact that the parties decided to have a child and contemplated having more children by storing sperm in California all points to the conclusion that the agreements carry no weight</p>

Such agreements are in fact recommended in relation to the removal of children in order to address the possibility of nonreturn and applications under the 1980 Hague Convention although the level of detail in these is perhaps more indicative of the Deceased imposing his will rather than simply protecting his legal position.</p>

The fact that the Deceased gifted the Claimant a property, was on her evidence fairly free in giving her money and on her evidence content for her to go on holiday frequently without him does not suggest that he was controlling in an abusive sense. However, the evidence makes clear that by dint of the fact that he was financially dominant that this gave him a significant level of de facto control.</p>

Insofar as one can infer that he considered that the provision he made for the Claimant and Elliot in his Will was reasonable and insofar as his wish that she should receive &#163;300,000 and Elliot should receive the sum of &#163;100,000 on trust and that this would cater for their needs it is clear that those wishes are inconsistent with any objective evaluation of what reasonable financial provision would be. In respect of his other testamentary wishes in terms of making provision for friends and family, making provision for Ms Adler and making provision for charity I think more respect is potentially required. Although it is not capable of determination on the evidence before me I strongly suspect that the Deceased would be horrified that hundreds of thousands of pounds of his hard earned investments are being expended on legal fees rather than being deployed to support individuals he identified in his Will. However there may also be a possibility, albeit I think a remote one, that he would have supported a scorched earth policy orchestrated by Ms Adler to deny the Claimant and Elliot anything other than that provided for in the Will. It would be desperately sad if that were the case but of course experience tells us that fact is stranger than fiction and so I cannot rule out that possibility. However the existence of both of those possibilities does not materially influence the evaluation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both the Claimant and Cripps rely on the conduct of Ms Adler in her attitude to the administration of the Estate and her conduct of these proceedings and the removal proceedings and the Chancery proceedings. She has withdrawn &#163;80,000 from Westbridge Investments which she appears to have had no right either as executor or as a director so to do. Her conduct has made the task of Cripps exceptionally difficult and extraordinarily expensive as a result of both her failure to provide proper documentation but also her failure to administer the companies appropriately in complying with their statutory responsibilities and in the day-to-day administration of their assets and liabilities. The evidence of Mr Sikkel abundantly demonstrates these failings, although the judgments in the Removal Proceedings, the Chancery Proceedings and the recent Companies Act proceedings would on their own illustrate those failings. Whether they are deliberate misfeasance, incompetence, lack of attention or health related (or a combination) they have occurred and as a result they have created huge costs, delay and stress. They each submit that she has wholly failed in the task that the Will set for her and inferentially in the Deceased&#8217;s expectation of her. She has certainly failed in the tasks one might have expected although whether in fact the Deceased would have expected a scorched earth approach to any challenge by the Claimant is moot. </p>

Given the length of marriage, the presence of a minor child, the fact that the Claimant undertook a traditional home making and caring role whilst the Deceased continued to be the money earner would support a starting point of equality. However the fact that the Deceased had been working for circa half a century building up a property business which comprises the entirety of the assets at the commencement of the marriage and which had not substantially changed in form (or so the evidence would suggest) over the course of the 17 odd years of marriage would suggest that there would be a strong argument that there should be some departure from equality based on premarital contributions. What that departure might have been in practice is speculative. It is even more speculative in practice because in a financial remedy case we would not be in the territory of uncertainty that we are now. A far greater degree of certainty over the net value of the distributable assets would have been likely. That might have influenced the degree of departure. Where the net distributable assets &#163;6 million on the basis of the wife receiving the FMH and capital of around &#163;2m in order to meet her and Elliot&#8217;s reasonable needs there may have been relatively little departure. Had the net distributable assets been closer to &#163;10 million a departure from equality of anything between 40/60 or 1/3-2/3 may have been argued over.</p>
