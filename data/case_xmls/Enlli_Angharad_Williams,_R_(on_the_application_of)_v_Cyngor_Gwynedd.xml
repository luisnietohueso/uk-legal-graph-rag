She argues that the council failed to appreciate that planning permission is only required for material changes of use and that, therefore, the direction would not have the effect of preventing all changes of use to classes C5 and C6.</span></p>

The council was concerned that the proportion of the housing stock that is not used as a main residence in some parts of Gwynedd is very high. It therefore concluded that it was expedient to make and confirm the direction in order to improve the provision of housing available to meet local need. Such reasons were consistent with the statutory purpose of the GPDO amendment order made in 2022 as explained at para. 4.4 of its explanatory memorandum.</span></p>

A change to use a primary residence as a second home or holiday home involves a change of use class and is no longer deemed by s.55(2) not to constitute development. Accordingly, it is inevitable that the direction will allow the council to control changes of use of the kind that it was previously unable to control.

Neither of the two extreme propositions - that using a dwellinghouse for commercial holiday lettings will always amount to a material change of use, or that use of a dwellinghouse for commercial holiday lettings can never amount to a change of use - is correct.&#8221;</span></p>

Equally, in my judgment, it is impossible to say that a change of use from C3 to C5 will necessarily amount to a material change of use. Indeed, some such changes of use might involve no more than a very modest change in the number of days that the house is occupied as a home.</span></p>

Properly read, the reports were not referring to the creation of additional housing stock that could be designated and secured as affordable housing in such technical sense. Rather, the point being made was far more straightforward. The direction would allow greater planning control of changes of use that would have the effect of preventing the depletion of the housing stock available for local need as principal residences, and might thereby contribute to making such housing more affordable. </span></p>

The Public Engagement Report observed that protecting housing stock to ensure that there is adequate provision to meet local needs would ensure that there is a permanent population within local communities. It observed that it was &#8220;hoped&#8221; that sustaining local communities would contribute to the prevalence of the Welsh language. It added:</span></p>

With the Welsh Government&#8217;s commitment to reach a million Welsh speakers by 2050, the ability to have better control of the housing stock and subsequently ensure that there is an adequate and affordable provision of housing for local people is a way of supporting this goal.&#8221;</span></p>

As he observed, this was not an exercise in precision and the council was entitled to conclude that the direction would assist in encouraging the growth, or at least in arresting the decline, in the use of the Welsh language and thereby of promoting the Welsh Government&#8217;s aim of achieving one million Welsh speakers. Any policy that might free up more of the housing stock for people who want to live and work in Gwynedd plainly might assist in protecting and encouraging the use of the Welsh language.</span></p>

There was evidence before the council that in some parts of the council area more than one third and even as much as half of the housing stock was being used as holiday accommodation. It is not arguable that the council erred in regarding that to be an exceptional circumstance that justified the making of the direction.</span></p>
