She made no standalone claim for a financial order at the time of the divorce by way of Form A. However, she did pray for a financial order in her petition, including a claim for a property adjustment order. The parties divorced later that year, with Decree Absolute/Final divorce order being pronounced on 18 December 2015, making it a 22-year marriage. </span></p>

Both took instructions and agreed that the least acrimonious and most proportionate way to proceed was on a submissions-only basis. Although it was acknowledged that there remained multiple points of peripheral factual dispute, it was not considered necessary to cross-examine either party on those points, given the key points of agreement and the simple issue requiring court consideration.</span></p>

The convenience and readiness of digital communication brings with it many benefits, but the failure to lodge bundles with the court (or a device from which witnesses can access them) is not one of them. Even when there are express judicial directions for the preparation of a bundle for use at the final hearing &#8211; as was the case here &#8211; the court routinely finds itself facing non-compliance with the same. As a basic point of practice and professional courtesy, steps must always be taken to ensure that the court is provided with a bundle for witnesses. If a digital bundle is to be used, a suitable neutral laptop or tablet, loaded with the digital bundle, must be provided for the witness box.</span></p>

In this case however, it marked a more fundamental concern because I required sight of the Wife&#8217;s petition from 2015 to see if she had prayed for a Financial Order at Part 10 or not. Without sight of the same there was no way of telling whether I had any &#8216;straw&#8217; with which to &#8216;make bricks&#8217; (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">E v E</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">&#160;[2008] 1 FLR 220, Singer J, &#167;17).</span></p>

For today&#8217;s purposes its agreed valuation stands at &#163;341,667, that being the average of three recently obtained informal estate agent appraisals. It is subject to a mortgage of c.&#163;59,000. Factoring in rough costs of sale, an agreed working figure for net equity stands at &#163;272,466 (&#8220;the Equity&#8221;). There are no other matrimonial assets. Both parties also have modest non-matrimonial debts; the Husband of c.&#163;13,000 and the Wife of c.&#163;17,000.</span></p>

It is unfortunate that there are neither current nor historic mortgage and/or bank statements on file. Absent the same, there is no forensic basis upon which to determine the total sums paid by the Husband since 2015, and neither is there any objective basis upon which to determine how that was applied against capital and interest. As an open position, the Husband invites me to conclude that there has been c,&#163;130,000 paid against the capital during that period, based on a crude multiplication of the current rate across the whole period. </span></p>

Both counsel were in firm agreement that neither party sought cross examination of the other and were content to proceed effectively on the basis that each parties&#8217; evidence was accepted at its highest on material disputed points.

The court will look critically at explanations for it; and, even irrespective of its effect upon the respondent, will be likely, by reason of it and subject to the potency of other factors, to reduce or even to eliminate its provision for the applicant. Nevertheless it remains important to address its effect upon the respondent. In some cases, albeit not in the present, a respondent can show that he has assumed financial obligations or otherwise arranged his financial affairs in the belief that the applicant would make no claim against him and that he has done so in a way which, even if it were possible, it would not be reasonable for him to put into reverse&#8221;</span></p>

The longer the lapse of time the more secure should he or she feel in the re-arrangement of financial affairs, and the less should any such claim be encouraged or entertained. Whether this notion is based upon some form of estoppel or upon public policy, it matters not.

This was a long marriage with four children. Both parties effectively have non-matrimonial assets which they have accrued in the decade post-separation which can equally be factored in to meet their needs so as to not prejudice consideration of the other assets. The Husband&#8217;s post-marital acquisition has been computed at c.&#163;85,000, and the Wife&#8217;s interest in her current matrimonial home at c.&#163;79,150.</span></p>

The FMH falls to be marketed for sale at the start of July 2025 and the proceeds to be divided in equal shares once the Husband&#8217;s &#163;85,000 interest has been factored in.</span></p>

I am satisfied that the Husband has assumed financial obligations or otherwise arranged his financial affairs in the belief that the Wife was making no claim against him (by her having remarried, started a new family and not made any financial contribution to the family) and that he has done so in a way which, even if it were possible, it would not be reasonable for him to put into reverse. His needs as primary carer for Noah would further justify such a division.</span></p>
