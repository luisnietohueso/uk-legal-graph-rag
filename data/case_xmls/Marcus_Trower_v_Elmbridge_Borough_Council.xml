The purpose of a PSPO is to impose measures to restrict or prevent incidences of anti-social behaviour.</p>

In broad terms the effect of the Order is to restrict the ability of boat-users to moor boats within certain defined areas of riverbank in the Borough.  Contravening a PSPO is a criminal offence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant, Marcus Trower, is described in the claim form as an &#8220;itinerant boat-dweller&#8221;, meaning that he lives permanently aboard a boat and travels the waterways of the south east of England, mooring up temporarily in different places rather than at one permanent mooring.  He usually visits the Council&#8217;s administrative area aboard his boat and stays for several weeks each year, moving location periodically.  He has family who live in the Borough and a seven-year old son who lives aboard the boat with him and whom Mr Trower home schools.</p>

He is a regular visitor to the Borough and the Order restricts his ability to moor his boat on parts of the riverbank &#8211; something which (in a public law context at least) he would otherwise be entitled to do by virtue of the public right of navigation (&#8220;PRN&#8221;) enjoyed by users of the River Thames.  By this claim he challenges the lawfulness of the Order, pursuant to the statutory right of challenge afforded by section 66 of the 2014 Act, on multiple grounds.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2019 the Council began the process of considering whether or not to make one or more PSPOs in respect of land in its administrative area.  A recommendation by officers that consultation on the proposed PSPOs be commenced was considered by the Council&#8217;s Cabinet on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2019.  The recommendation was approved but no further steps were taken at the time, it is assumed because of the intervening Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Consideration of the proposals did not resume until early 2022.  On 8 February 2022 the Council&#8217;s Cabinet received a further report recommending that consultation commence on potential PSPOs to tackle issues of the use of portable fire pits and barbecues (for which the Council&#8217;s evidence uses the shorthand of the &#8220;naked flames&#8221; PSPO), overnight camping and fishing, and unauthorised mooring on the riverbank within five areas owned by the Council (being land at Ditton Reach, Albany Reach, Cigarette Island, Cowey Sale, and Hurst Park) and one owned by Surrey County Council (being land adjacent to Hampton Court bridge).  The same report considered the possibility of a fourth PSPO relating to anti-social behaviour involving dogs but it was not pursued.</p>

Officers recommended the making of the proposed PSPOs relating to naked flames and overnight fishing.  In relation to unauthorised mooring, whilst the report noted &#8220;strong support&#8221; for this proposed PSPO the view was expressed by officers that some aspects of the proposals &#8220;require further clarity&#8221; and so a second consultation was recommended.  This recommendation was agreed to.  The report nevertheless summarised the questions in the first consultation and analysed the responses received to date.  </p>

A majority of the comments supported the making of the Order but a significant minority were opposed to it, articulating various different reasons for their opposition.  Some of those opposed to the Order were clearly boat users themselves.  Others were local residents who nevertheless felt that either the Order was not necessary or that the measures contained within it to restrict anti-social behaviour were inappropriate and/or excessive. </p>

Use of the word &#8220;justifies&#8221; requires a proportionality test, and for that to be conducted there needs to be sufficient certainty around what activities are prohibited and in what restricted area (section 59(4)), not least because of the penal sanctions attaching to a breach.  Mr Stark sought to draw an analogy with the approach of the Courts to breaches of ambiguous injunctions, citing the trade-mark case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Redwing Limited v Redwing Forest Products Limited</span> [1947] RPC 67 and commentary in section 26.4 of &#8220;Bennion on Statutory Interpretation&#8221; (the section is entitled &#8220;Principle against doubtful penalisation&#8221;), all of which illustrate (he submitted) that insufficiently clear provisions to which penal sanctions attach cannot be enforced.</p>

There was, he submitted, no evidence to show that boats moored for longer than 24 hours were any more likely to have (for example) caused littering than boats moored for less than 24 hours.  Mr Stark added that all of the witness evidence in support of the Council&#8217;s case illustrated that, to the extent that the problem of littering could be shown to be associated with unauthorised moorings, the evidence was confined to long-term moorings. This was echoed in the minutes of the meeting held by the Council with the Vice Chair (i.e. the Claimant) and the Chair of the NBTA in October 2023.  In those circumstances the Council could not show that the prohibition was necessary, hence the criterion of justification in section 59(3)(c) could not be made out.</p>

The challenge in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Summers</span> attacked in particular the provisions of a PSPO restricting the number of dogs that any one person could take to a public space without a specific licence.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">The Act therefore envisages use of PSPOs to curb activities which it is possible that not everyone would view as detrimentally affecting their quality of life. Taken together with the absence of any further definition of the key terms &#8220;activities&#8221; or &#8220;detrimental&#8221; this strongly points to local authorities being given a wide discretion to decide what behaviours are troublesome and require to be addressed within their local area. This requires local knowledge, taking into account conditions on the ground, exercising judgment (i) about what activities need to be covered by a PSPO and (ii) what prohibitions or restrictions are appropriate for inclusion in the order. There may be strong feelings locally about whether any particular activity does or does not have a detrimental effect, in such cases a local authority will need to weigh up competing interests. Deciding whether, and if so what, controls on certain behaviours or activities may be necessary within the area covered by a local authority is thus the very essence of local politics.</p>

On neither basis could the Council&#8217;s approach be said to be legally flawed.</p>

The purpose of the policy was not to attempt to vary the terms of the Order but to explain how the Council would enforce it by setting out a further explanation of what the provisions mean.  This was not unreasonable and it is, submitted Mr Hoar, precisely what was intended by the statutory guidance published under s73 of the 2014 Act.  He likened the relationship between the Order and the EEP to the relationship between an Act of Parliament and the explanatory notes published alongside it.  Moreover the Council is bound by its EEP and, as a matter of public law, must follow it.  In the event of any uncertainty in the interpretation of the Order the EEP helps to explain it by binding the Council to follow a particular interpretation.</p>

By limiting the period for unauthorised moorings the restrictions in the Order were reasonable and appropriate to prevent the defined anti-social behaviour from taking place, even though some boats mooring for longer than the 24-hour period will not engage in that behaviour (and, by the same token, some mooring even for less than 24 hours may litter or create noise or obstruct other boat users).</p>

The operative part comes in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Order, with the related definitions, from which I see no real doubt that it is unauthorised mooring without more which is prohibited.

There are passages within it which offer support in interpreting aspects of the Order which may be unclear.  I have commented on these above when dismissing the Claimant&#8217;s complaints about three aspects of the Order.  In each of those instances my primary conclusion is that there is no significant doubt about what the Order means and that the EEP is a helpful but not essential aid to interpretation.  The EEP is uncontroversial in those instances because what it says reinforces how the Order is reasonably interpreted in the first place. But for other aspects of the EEP, whilst it is helpful in understanding how enforcement officers will exercise their prosecutorial discretion in any given case, all it can deal with is &#8220;how&#8221; enforcement takes place.  &#8220;What&#8221; can be enforced against must be based on the terms of the Order itself.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the most part the content of the EEP guides the exercise of discretion by enforcement officers, but it does not circumscribe it.  Thus one sees references within the content to enforcement officers acting in a way that is &#8220;partial and objective&#8221;, to &#8220;normally&#8221; offering the chance to discharge liability on conviction with a fixed penalty notice, and to issuing fixed penalty notices where a breach has been witnessed by the officer or where there is &#8220;reliable&#8221; witness testimony.  Each of these examples still admits of the exercise of discretion by the enforcement officer (for example as to what are &#8220;normal&#8221; circumstances or what is &#8220;reliable&#8221; witness testimony).  A person prosecuted for breach cannot use as a defence the mere fact that it was unreasonable to conclude that they should be prosecuted for a prima facie breach in the first place; if a breach has been established then how the discretion to prosecute for it has been exercised does not avail the defendant of a defence to the charge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition the EEP sets the level of fine for offences dealt with by fixed penalty notices.  These parts of the EEP are more definite and prescriptive.  For breaches of a PSPO generally the EEP fixes the level of fine where a fixed penalty notice is used, stating emphatically that &#8220;The amount of the Fixed Penalty Notice shall be &#163;100&#8221; with an appropriate deduction for prompt payment.  But it is relevant to note two things about this.  Firstly, to the extent that this is a concession it is a concession applying only to sanction not to liability.  Secondly, the wording of this part of the EEP mirrors almost exactly the wording of the Order (omitting only the statutory reference &#8211; section 67 &#8211; under which a person who does not pay the fixed penalty notice may be prosecuted).  Nothing in this part of the EEP seeks to embellish or re-interpret the provisions of the Order itself.  In my judgement the same cannot necessarily be said for the section of the EEP dealing with the enforcement of the Order.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.48in">as to the second, by any analysis 24 hours is not a long period of time.  However, Mr Hoar was right to submit that the line needs to be drawn somewhere.  Whilst some may question whether 24 hours was the right limit to select, I cannot conclude that the selection of it was irrational in the face of the evidence.  There was extensive consultation in two stages which elicited over 1,000 consultation responses.  Some respondents supported the proposal for 24 hours, others suggested that a longer period was more appropriate.  The NBTA provided a detailed response to consultation in which it queried the suitability of 24 hours, both in terms of practicalities and because (it submitted) a 24-hour restriction would infringe the PRN enjoyed by boat dwellers contrary to both common law and (in this location) section 79 of the 1932 Act.  In the Cabinet report one of the &#8220;other comments&#8221; summarised by officers stated: &#8220;Give consideration to a 2 week restriction (similar to Henley) or a 36 to 72 hour restriction would be fairer especially for visitors, or disabled people who may need to rest before moving moorings again&#8221;.  The possibility of still utilising a PSPO but with a longer period of permitted mooring had therefore been raised by consultees and reported as such to members.  The Council&#8217;s officers provided a reasoned justification for why they did not agree with either contention.  In his witness evidence Mr Burrows confirms that variations on a 24-hour restriction were considered by members when the proposal was debated at Cabinet.  Mr Stark highlights the fact that there are no minutes of the Cabinet discussions available to verify that fact.  That is true, but equally nobody has been able to gainsay the sworn evidence of Mr Burrows about what was discussed.  I am therefore prepared to take at face value the fact that other possibilities besides a 24-hour restriction were discussed.  This would also not be at all surprising given the focus of a lot of the objections  </p>

As Mr Hoar submitted, some 17 year olds may be better able to cope with the consumption of alcohol than will some 19 year olds, yet the law fixes the threshold for lawful alcohol purchase (other than in pubs and restaurants) at 18 years old.  Similarly some boat users mooring for less than 24 hours may be guilty of littering when some mooring for a lot longer than that may be much more responsible and cause no such problems.  There is a need to impose a defined limit such that enforcement can be effective.  It was rational for the Council to conclude that fixing the limit at 24 hours will make a significant contribution towards preventing a recurrence of the anti-social behaviour which prompted the promotion of the PSPO.  Whilst in no way a comparative exercise I also noted that, set side by side with the one hour limit imposed through byelaws in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Akerman</span> (which passed without adverse comment by the Divisional Court notwithstanding a complaint about infringement of the PRN), 24 hours in this case looks generous.</p>

The passage from the guidance selected by Mr Stark to make good his submission &#8211; at page 64 - merely reminds the Council of the importance of focusing on specific behaviours, on selecting proportionate restrictions, and of the overarching objective of preventing anti-social behaviour from occurring or recurring.  This guidance, it seems to me, is no more than a reminder of the statutory criteria.  The Claimant may dispute the conclusions which the Council reached when applying the criteria but the guidance affords no independent ground of complaint.</p>

Whilst there is reference to other neighbouring Boroughs imposing similar restrictions, the motivation for the Council is not to mirror the approach of other Boroughs for the sake of it but to protect against the very realistic possibility that boat users in neighbouring areas will now likely be displaced into the Council&#8217;s administrative area, thus resulting in greater pressure on the Council&#8217;s public spaces and a greater likelihood of anti-social behaviour being experienced.  This much can be seen from the very passage of the Council&#8217;s Cabinet report upon which Mr Stark based his submissions about ulterior motive:</p>

The Council maintains that 24 hours is a duration which it has identified from custom and practice (for example that adopted by the Environment Agency) as being reasonable and that it would not amount to an unlawful interference with the PRN.  The Claimant has not been able to gainsay this;</p>

Other boat users have a similar right to moor for a reasonable period, and if another boat user is already there and is overstaying a reasonable period then the later arriving boat user&#8217;s PRN is being interfered with.  The Council can thus reasonably maintain that in restricting unauthorised moorings to a defined period the terms of the Order are actually preserving the PRN for other river users.  That this point was in the mind of officers can be seen from the following comment made in response to the NBTA&#8217;s consultation response: </p>

As to the complaint that the consultation did not identify alternatives for consultees to consider, I agree with Mr Hoar that it is self-evident when considering a proposal for a 24-hour limitation that other time periods could be considered as reasonable alternatives.  As I have shown above, one of the consultees is recorded as having suggested consideration of two weeks, 36 hours or 72 hours as alternatives.  The fact that a period longer or shorter than 24 hours was an alternative that could be considered did not need to be spelled out in the consultation.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly the Council had a good impression of the likely make-up of the boat dwelling community from the interviews it conducted as part of its Boat Dwellers Accommodation Assessment.  85% of boat dwellers interviewed were under the age of 65.  None were observed to be pregnant or with young children.  None were observed to have, or claimed to have, a disability.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence does not demonstrate that a significant proportion of those affected by the Order did have one of the protected characteristics claimed to be absent from the consideration.  The Claimant&#8217;s complaint is therefore an hypothetical one.  In my judgement the Council&#8217;s consideration of the arguments for and against the making of the Order displays an even-handed assessment and an appropriate balance between the benefits of the Order and the ways in which the proposed Order could be moderated to affect those with protected characteristics in a less severe way (namely the duration of stay allowed to unauthorised moorers).  And there is in any event, as I have noted above, the ability to turn what would otherwise be an unauthorised mooring into an authorised one by procuring the Council&#8217;s permission to moor on its land, at which point the special circumstances of any boat user (amounting to a protected characteristic or otherwise) could be referred to as part of the request for authorisation.</p>

The requirement is to have &#8220;due regard&#8221; to the PSED (see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bracking</span> at [67]), viewed through the lens of [25] principle 8(i) that I have cited above, and I am satisfied on the evidence that this is what the Council did.  </p>

That, of course, is a complaint which is not directly relevant to the present proceedings (which challenge the lawfulness of the Order, not the Local Plan review process).  Nevertheless I accept that the data collected as part of the Assessments is relevant to the process leading to the making of the Order even though that is not the purpose for which they were commissioned.  Data on, for example, the age profile of boat dwellers surveyed is relevant to the Claimant&#8217;s PSED grounds and I have referred to it in this context above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have commented above on the relevance of the Assessments to the EqIA undertaken by the Council.  The Assessments were two of the several documents which accompanied the Council&#8217;s second consultation.  The NBTA, as I have noted above, made a series of criticisms about how the Assessments had been used by the Council.  Heine Planning Consultancy was also critical about this point.  The Cabinet report appended a copy of the two consultation responses interspersed with officers&#8217; comments on them.  Members of the Cabinet will therefore have been aware of what was said about the Assessments by both two objectors to the Order and by the Council&#8217;s officers in reply.  </p>

Nevertheless this is not a case in which the Claimant is attempting to resist enforcement of the Order by the Council in part on procedural grounds.  Similarly it is not a case where the Claimant is alleging he has been prejudiced by being unaware of the existence of the Order because there had been a failure in carrying out post-confirmation notifications.  Had this been either type of case then the question of whether the process leading to the making of the Order and the notification procedures which are required to follow it would have been more directly relevant.  But as things stand nobody can be said to have been prejudiced by the failure.</p>

There was no objection from Mr Stark and the request seems sensible to me in the circumstances.  It will, of course, be important for the Council&#8217;s legal team to impress upon the additional recipients the terms of the embargo (which are otherwise unchanged from the standard form) especially if they are unused to receiving draft judgments under these circumstances.</p>
