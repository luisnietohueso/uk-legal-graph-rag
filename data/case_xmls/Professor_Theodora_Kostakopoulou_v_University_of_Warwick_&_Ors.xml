Thus the court should hesitate about making a final decision  without a trial, even where there is no obvious conflict of fact at the time  of the application, where reasonable grounds exist for believing that a  fuller investigation into the facts of the case would add to or alter the  evidence available to a trial judge and so affect the outcome of the case.  </p>

The reason is quite simple: if the respondent's case is bad in  law, he will in truth have no real prospect of succeeding on his claim or  successfully defending the claim against him, as the case may be.  Similarly, if the applicant's case is bad in law, the sooner that is  determined, the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although  material in the form of documents or oral evidence that would put the  documents in another light is not currently before the court, such  material is likely to exist and can be expected to be available at trial, it  would be wrong to give summary judgment because there would be a  real, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success. However, it is not  enough simply to argue that the case should be allowed to go to trial  because something may turn up which would have a bearing on the  question of construction.&#8221; </p>

At most, the evidence suggests (no more) that Professor Sanders may have overlooked the Claimant&#8217;s diary obligations on one or two occasions when he put forward dates for a meeting, and it shows that the University&#8217;s HR department had a role in progressing the disciplinary investigation and in the drafting of a report. That evidence does not, even arguably, have the significance which the Claimant seeks to attach to it. Nor do emails showing, for example, that one or more new Professors were being recruited, or that there were internal communications mentioning the fact that the Claimant, having been suspended, would not be available to carry out teaching engagements, or that Professor Sanders accessed some of her work emails to deal with matters arising from her absence. Even if any of this material could be deployed to any effect in the Claimant&#8217;s Employment Tribunal proceedings, none of it would reveal that fraud was used to procure Sir Andrew Nicol&#8217;s conclusions as to the legal obstacles to her 2021 High Court claim.  </p>

It is notable that Lord Dyson in <span style="font-style:italic">Chesterfield</span> expressly considered the manner of a dismissal which might be unfair because of defamatory remarks made in the course of the dismissal and which, it was alleged had made it harder for the Claimant to obtain another job. That is precisely what the Claimant says is her position. However, the authorities show that she must seek any remedy in that regard in the Employment Tribunal. The Claimant was suspended in the course of the dismissal process but, as I understand it, the suspension was on full pay and so the suspension did not cause her loss separate and distinct from the dismissal itself: certainly, no such loss is pleaded. </p>

There are numerous allegations of duplication and double counting but the same applies to those.

However, counsel&#8217;s fee note refers on one line dated 18 October 2021 to &#8220;Brief on Applications&#8221; and the sum of &#163;13,500, on the next line dated 19 October 2021 to &#8220;Refresher&#8221; with no separate figure, and then on a third line dated 19 October 2021 to &#8220;Conference with Client&#8221; and a figure of &#163;3,000. The Claimant urges me to draw the  conclusion that the original claim for counsel&#8217;s fees of &#163;16,500 was fraudulent and that the true figure was &#163;13,500, contending also that a conference on 19 October could not have given rise to a fee of anything like &#163;3,000.  </p>

His order therefore recognised the fact that the sums sought by the Defendants would or at least could be disputed by the Claimant. That is a further reason why the more detailed criticisms of the Defendants&#8217; costs claim made by the Claimant in claim 1772 fall far short of establishing a <span style="font-style:italic">Takhar </span>ground for overturning the order.  </p>

On 8 July 2024, she applied for an order that the Defendants disclose &#8220;the final statute bill of [the Defendants&#8217; solicitors] and receipts in [the 2021 claim] and to confirm that Zurich Insurance cover their legal costs&#8221;. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.05in;text-indent:0in">She relied on the contents of an email which she had sent to Master Dagnall on 2 July 2024. That email principally dealt with her application for default judgment, but she sought the information about insurance because &#8220;if the University&#8217;s insurance with Zurich covered the costs &#8230; and the Defendants are not actually &#8216;out of pocket&#8217;, they have not suffered any loss that needs to be recovered through seeking and enforcing a charging order on our property&#8221;, and &#8220;my fundamental rights to a fair hearing, respect for private and family life and property cannot be prejudiced by vague, uncorroborated, unassessed, unreasonable and disproportionate costs demands&#8221;. </p>

The Claimant&#8217;s point about insurance is misconceived, because the existence of insurance against legal costs does not prevent a party from obtaining or enforcing a costs order. No doubt the Defendant&#8217;s &#8220;final statute bill&#8221; would be of interest in any detailed assessment of their costs, but there is no reason to believe that its disclosure would reveal anything which could support claim 1772.  </p>

It applies not only where there has been service, but no compliance with the conditions in CPR 12.3, but also where there has been no valid service at all. Failure to file an acknowledgment of service in CPR 12.3(1) means failure to file when under a duty to file, and if there has been no valid service, there is no duty to acknowledge service. </p>

The fact is that court orders have effect unless and until they are set aside. The Claimant has not identified any proper reason why the LCRO could or should be regarded as a nullity, rather than an order against which she could attempt to appeal. I have no power to hear an appeal against the order of Martin Spencer J, and I am satisfied that nothing has been raised that could go beyond an appeal and strike at the very existence or validity of the LCRO.  </p>

Moreover, the debate about the status of the emails in question cannot hide the fact that the EAT activity summarised at paragraph 156 above contains several of the hallmarks of the other applications which have been certified as TWM such as a refusal to accept defeat on any point, insistence that adverse orders are void and questioning of the good faith of judges.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.48in;margin-right:0.05in">The fact is that, whatever the underlying merits of her long-running disputes with the Defendants, the Claimant has grossly misused the procedures of the Courts and Tribunals. She refuses to recognise that fact and seems to assert a right to continue in the same vein. I conclude that there is a serious threat that that conduct will continue, and that it may occur outside the confines of the </p>

In order to ensure that the terms of the LCRO have been respected, I have asked Warby LJ to discharge the LCRO and, simultaneously with my order, he is making an order to that effect.  </p>

Instead of clerical corrections, it just contained further attempts to argue her case on the merits, none of which were of any assistance to the Court. Nor were a string of emails which she put before me, putting questions to the University&#8217;s solicitors about disclosure relating to one of its HR managers. </p>

I anticipate no difficulty in considering any reason put forward by the Claimant why costs should not follow the event. If costs are awarded, there will also be no difficulty for the Court in deciding whether there is any &#8220;good reason&#8221; not to order an interim payment under CPR 44.2(a) and in identifying the appropriate level of any such payment. </p>

In the absence of some compelling reason it will not be appropriate to grant any extension of that deadline. I will then deal with costs on paper. </p>
