The applicant made representations to the Secretary of State in support of such a decision by a letter dated 8 September 2022.  MS leave was said to be necessary to enable the applicant&#8217;s mental health to recover from his trafficking experiences and as a form of restitution.  To that end, the applicant relied on a psychological report by Dr Rachel Thomas dated 24 March 2022 (&#8220;the Thomas report&#8221;). Secondly, it would provide him with the security he needed to defend himself during, and cope generally with, his criminal trial. The applicant also relied on a trafficking report dated 16 May 2022 by Mr Steve Harvey, and made other representations about his private and family life.</span></p>

Secondly, it failed to engage with the Competent Authority&#8217;s failure to refer the domestic servitude in 2013 to the Metropolitan Police Service (issue (2)).  Thirdly, it failed to apply anxious scrutiny to the medical evidence provided to the Secretary of State about the applicant&#8217;s need for therapy in order to address the trauma of his trafficking experiences. The medical evidence demonstrated that the applicant would need to be granted leave to remain in order effectively to commence the necessary therapy. That was issue (3).

The applicant plainly had to remain in the United Kingdom in order to defend the criminal proceedings. He would not have been able to exonerate himself for the crimes he was forced to commit as a result of his modern slavery. Those details were before the Secretary of State including the defence statement relied on by the applicant and the criminal proceedings. It was plainly necessary for the applicant to &#8220;stay&#8221; in the United Kingdom, for the purposes of article 14 (1). He should have been granted MS leave on that basis, Mr Buttler submitted.</span></p>

While the Competent Authority referred the second period of the applicant&#8217;s modern slavery to the relevant police force, it did not refer the earlier period of domestic servitude. The applicant&#8217;s stay in the United Kingdom was therefore necessary pending the investigation of the 2013 domestic servitude. Unless and until the Metropolitan Police Service informed the Secretary of State that the applicant&#8217;s presence in the United Kingdom was no longer necessary in order for those offences to be investigated, it was incumbent upon the Secretary of State to grant the applicant MS leave. Mr Buttler relied upon scope and extent of the investigative duty to which contracting parties to the ECHR are subject pursuant to their duties under Article 4 of that convention (prohibition of slavery and forced labour).</span></p>

Dr Thomas had concluded that, although some of the applicant&#8217;s medication would be available in Nigeria, it would not be accessible to him. The Thomas report demonstrated that the applicant experiences significant treatment needs. Those included moderate to severe symptoms of a major depressive disorder with additional psychotic features (page 205), and a range of other conditions. The applicant would not be able to engage with treatment for those conditions in the absence of the stability that would have been provided by a grant of MS leave.  The 12 December decision failed to engage with that issue.</span></p>

Mr Buttler also submitted that the applicant&#8217;s financial circumstances were such that Article 8(1) ECHR was engaged by the 12 December decision. In the absence of any leave to remain, the applicant was unable to work, and was unable to access the social assistance benefits he would otherwise be entitled to.

The provision made under Chapter III to further the protection and assistance of victims of trafficking includes the identification of victims illuminates these objectives.  The structure of Chapter III is identification of victims (Article 10), the protection of their private life (Article 11), assistance for victims&#8217; physical, psychological and social recovery (Article 12), recovery and reflection (Article 13), the issue of residence permits (Article 14, the present issue), compensation and redress (Article 15), repatriation and return of victims (Article 16) and gender equality (Article 17).  These factors contribute to meeting some of the therapeutic and recovery needs experienced by victims of modern slavery, and make provision for a victim&#8217;s need to stay in the host state as an adjunct to those objectives.  In my judgment, the objectives pursued by these provisions are not sufficiently related to the personal circumstances of a defendant to criminal proceedings to bring that a defendant to criminal proceedings within Article 14(1)(a).</span></p>

I accept Mr Irwin&#8217;s submission that it would be surprising that, in addition to the express provision made by Article 14(1)(b) for matters relating to criminal investigations and prosecutions, there existed a separate, implied, basis for a victim of trafficking to be granted a residence permit in the host country in order to be prosecuted, under the auspices of Article 14(1)(a).

There is no suggestion that the Convention mandates the provision of a complete defence as a matter of criminal law (although that would be one way to meet that obligation: see section 45 of the 2015 Act, which Mr Irwin confirmed in his submissions is the means by which the United Kingdom has chosen to implement this obligation).  Put another way, at its highest Article 26 addresses the punishment to be faced by victims of modern slavery, rather than their substantive criminal liability.</span></p>

The submission exceeds the minimum standards imposed by the Convention.  It is based on the footing that it is &#8220;necessary&#8221; for a victim of modern slavery to &#8220;stay&#8221; in order to enjoy a benefit that the Convention itself does not confer, namely a complete defence to charges. It is difficult to construe Article 14(1)(a) as requiring the host country to regard a victim&#8217;s stay as necessary such that a residence permit must be issued in order to defend criminal proceedings on modern slavery grounds in circumstances where, pursuant to Article 26, all that the Convention requires is for States Parties to provide for the &#8220;possibility of not imposing penalties on victims for their involvement in unlawful activities&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

The imposition or non-imposition (as the case may be) of a penalty is subsidiary to the substantive process of assigning criminal liability.  If the Convention does not regard a stay as necessary in order to contest substantive criminal liability, it would be surprising if it regarded the stay of a victim of modern slavery to be necessary in order to participate in an ancillary process.</span></p>

This point may be stated simply: nothing in the detailed narrative provided in the Explanatory Report supports the applicant&#8217;s submission.  The focus of Article 14, and paras 180 to 190 of the Explanatory Report, lies in the provision of residence permits as a means to secure the assistance of victims of modern slavery in the criminal process (para. 181, final sentence), or on account of the victim&#8217;s needs (para. 184).  There is no mention of a stay being necessary to defend criminal proceedings, or even to rely on the non-punishment provision in Article 26, in those paragraphs or elsewhere in the Explanatory Report.</span></p>

That is consistent with a textual analysis of the Convention, in light of its aims, purpose and context.  It would be surprising if the framers of the Convention sought to confer a substantive right of residence, and the attendant benefits deriving from a residence permit, on defendants to criminal proceedings, in circumstances where there is no mention of that objective in the text of the Convention, and the Explanatory Report is silent on the point.</span></p>

Mr Buttler sought to make what he described as the &#8220;contextual submission&#8221; that that process breached the investigative duty mandated Article 4 of the ECHR, and that the Secretary of State was required to satisfy herself that the applicant&#8217;s stay was not required for </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">that </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">investigation prior to taking the 12 December decision.

The rationale behind Article 27(1) &#8220;is to avoid traffickers&#8217; subjecting victims to pressure and threats in attempts to deter them from complaining to the authorities&#8221; (Explanatory Report, para. 277).   Nothing in Article 27(1) entitles the applicant&#8217;s experienced and publicly-funded legal team to decline to refer a matter to the relevant police force in the event that they had concerns that a matter had not been investigated properly: see the extract from the judgment of Burnett LJ to which emphasis has been added above.

Dr Thomas accepted at para. 182 that her expertise does not lie in the provision of psychological therapy or medical intervention in Nigeria.  More significantly, the report details a range of underlying trauma experienced by the applicant over a considerable period of time.  Those experiences included &#8220;that his time in Sudan as a child had been particularly traumatic&#8221; due to the ongoing conflict at the time, his exposure to dead bodies, and sustaining an injury caused by an army officer (paras 9 and 10).  The applicant was instructed by the Nigerian Embassy to return to Nigeria to see his ailing father, only to find that he was already dead upon arrival.  He also found out that the family home had been burned down by Boko Haram (para. 22), and was subsequently abandoned by his mother, who he now assumes to be dead (para. 78).  Later trauma experienced by the applicant includes the two periods of modern slavery.  The applicant reports that his psychiatric symptoms commenced upon the death of his father (para. 79).  Dr Thomas considered that the applicant minimised the impact of his mother&#8217;s neglect of him (para. 82), and the impact upon him of not being able to work to provide for his family (para. 83).</span></p>

As the Secretary of State&#8217;s pre-action protocol response put it, the applicant had not commenced any treatment in the UK.  Since appropriate treatment would be available in Nigeria, the Secretary of State was entitled to conclude that his stay was not necessary in Article 14(1)(a) terms.  Moreover, the obligation upon the Secretary of State contained in the DL policy is not to ensure the provision of support enabling a full recovery (see page 729 of the bundle).</span></p>

The applicant was already exposed to the consequences of the so-called &#8216;hostile environment&#8217; on account of his status as an overstayer.   He enjoyed no ECAT-based entitlement to be granted MS leave.  It was not, therefore, the 12 December decision which had the effect of continuing his exposure to the hostile environment, but a combination of his status as an overstayer and the Secretary of State&#8217;s inaction on his (separate) Article 8-based human rights claim, which he made on 8 July 2018.  The applicant&#8217;s true complaint is that the Secretary of State had not taken a timely decision in response to his Article 8 family life human rights claim made on that date.  Other than raising the issue of delay in pre-action correspondence on 23 February 2023, the applicant has not brought proceedings to challenge the alleged unlawful delay in the consideration of his Article 8 claim.</span></p>

For the reasons set out above, it was consistent with Article 14(1) of ECAT, and to the extent it was the Secretary of State&#8217;s policy to act consistently with those requirements, that policy objective was met.  That is significant because it demonstrates that, in contrast to the position in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">XY</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">, there was no underlying ECAT-based or public law unlawfulness in the decision of the Secretary of State.  It was common ground that the applicant in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">XY </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">was entitled to MS leave, since he had been granted MS leave shortly before proceedings were commenced.  Lane J held that the Secretary of State had adopted a secret policy which materially departed from her published policy, whereby her officials were instructed not to issue MS decisions.  Moreover, such decisions, when taken, were unlawfully served to the file, rather than on the applicant, thereby depriving him of the opportunity to challenge the decision.  Accordingly, the Secretary of State&#8217;s unlawful actions directly deprived the XY of the very leave which the Secretary of State later accepted that he was entitled to.  In those circumstances, the effect of the continued exposure to the hostile environment was directly and causally linked to the unlawful MS leave decision.  By contrast, in these proceedings, I have held that there has been no such unlawfulness, and therefore no causal link.</span></p>
