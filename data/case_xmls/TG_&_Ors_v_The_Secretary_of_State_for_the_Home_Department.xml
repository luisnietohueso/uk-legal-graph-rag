Each claimant contends that he was a vulnerable person, whose disabilities and experiences of torture, serious physical and/or psychological violence and human trafficking were either known to the defendant, should have been discovered by the defendant on reasonable inquiry or were drawn to her attention during the period of their accommodation at Wethersfield. The claimants say that the evidence filed in support of their claims shows that being accommodated at Wethersfield resulted in a significant deterioration in their mental health and worsening of their underlying mental disorders. The defendant is said to have acted unlawfully in failing to act on that evidence in a timely way and to transfer the claimants out of Wethersfield, failing to do so until either claims for judicial review or applications for interim relief had been made on their behalf.</p>

The first theme is the contention that the defendant operates an unlawful policy in deciding whether vulnerable asylum seekers are suitable to be accommodated at Wethersfield. The second theme is that the defendant&#8217;s allocations process is ineffective for the purpose of ensuring that vulnerable asylum seekers for whom accommodation at Wethersfield is not adequate are not accommodated at that site. There is a clear overlap between these two themes, since it is argued that the defendant&#8217;s Allocation Policy casts the burden of inquiry onto the vulnerable asylum seeker who lacks the resources to discharge it; whereas the duty of reasonable inquiry is placed by law upon the defendant herself under the <span style="font-style:italic">Tameside</span> principle. </p>

It is said that these reports show that those deficiencies have been drawn to the defendant&#8217;s attention over many months but that little, if any, progress has been made in addressing them. The claimants contend that the findings of those reports align with the evidence given by the claimants themselves and those who give evidence on their behalf with the benefit of extensive experience of providing legal, medical and welfare support services to asylum seekers accommodated by the defendant at Wethersfield. They argue that this extensive body of evidence casts significant doubt on the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;correctness, candour and credibility of the defendant&#8217;s witnesses as to their description of the site and its onsite arrangements&#8221;</span>.</p>

I do not find any reason to question their candour or credibility. In my view, each of the defendant&#8217;s witnesses has provided a candid and careful account of the matters which fell to them to address in response to these claims. The defendant submitted that her witnesses gave evidence from their perspective, based on the matters which they witnessed and what they had been told by others including staff and residents. To that might also be added the information which they have drawn from the documentary record which describes procedures and individual events and case histories. I agree. The same is of course also true of the witnesses who have given evidence in witness statements on behalf of the claimants. I regard their evidence also as both candid and carefully given. As the defendant says, it is unsurprising that witnesses who base their evidence to some degree at least on different sources will gain and offer a different impression to others. That does not justify treating their evidence as lacking in credibility, although it does mean that the court should be alive to the differences and the sources which lead to them.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to bear in mind that the main thrust of the defendant&#8217;s case in response to the systemic challenge is that the proper focus for judicial review is the constituent elements of the system under challenge, and the policies, procedures and arrangements of which it consists. It is not, the defendant contends, for the judicial review court to audit the performance of that system, to rule on how effectively or ineffectively it is being operated. In other words, the question for the judicial review court is whether the system under challenge is capable of being operated so as lawfully to discharge the statutory duties placed upon the defendant to provide accommodation in support of asylum seekers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>.  The defendant&#8217;s evidence in response to the systemic challenge is primarily guided by that approach to the systemic challenge. I did not understand there to be any significant factual dispute as to what the defendant&#8217;s system for discharging her functions under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref>, 96 and 98 of IAA 1999 consists of, insofar as is relevant to decision making which results in asylum seekers being accommodated at Wethersfield.</p>

Ordinarily, in determining a claim for judicial review of administrative action, the court will focus on the state of relevant matters as at the time of the decision which is the subject of the challenge and the sequence of events which culminated in that decision. What happens after the decision was taken will ordinarily be of less significance, since the focus will be on the legality, rationality or procedural propriety of the decision challenged, considered in the context of the legal framework and factual circumstances in which it was taken.  However, I accept that in the circumstances of the present claims, in considering the systemic grounds of challenge it is appropriate for me, insofar as I am able to do so on the evidence before the court, to take account of the current position. Thus, by way of example, in considering grounds 3 and 5 which challenge the lawfulness of the Allocation Policy, I shall base my conclusions on version 12 of that policy published on 27 March 2024, notwithstanding that none of the four claimants was accommodated at Wethersfield under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref> when version 12 was in operation.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Catherine Stratton provides statistical information showing the growing demand for asylum accommodation over recent years. Since 2020, small boats have been the predominant recorded method of entry for irregular arrivals. The year 2022 saw an increase of upwards of 60% in the number of people detected arriving and entering the United Kingdom illegally by means of small boats and applying for asylum, when compared with 2021. This represents upwards of a 14,000% increase since 2018. Combined with the increased time taken to deal with asylum applications and a nationwide housing shortage, this meant that demand for asylum accommodation was far outstripping supply. In September 2023, it was estimated that the defendant was accommodating over 119,010 asylum seekers. Of those, around 56,042 were in hotels at a total cost to the public purse of approximately &#163;8 million per day. By contrast, at the previous peak in 2002, just over 12,000 people had been placed in short term emergency accommodation.</p>

Wethersfield and other large-scale sites were considered by the defendant to provide adequate and functional accommodation with which to discharge her functions under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>. Such sites were designed to be as self-sufficient as possible, helping to minimise the impact on local communities and services. Ms Stratton says that the defendant considers that the efforts to reduce hotel usage are working, with a reduction in the supported population in hotels by around 18% in the quarter between September and December 2023.</p>

The initial cohort of asylum seekers to be accommodated at Wethersfield arrived at that ex-Ministry of Defence (MoD) site on 12 July 2023. On the same day, the defendant published version 9 of the Allocation Policy. Since that date, the defendant has revised the Allocation Policy on three occasions, publishing version 10 on 9 October 2023, version 11 on 12 February 2024 and version 12 on 27 March 2024. Each of those versions of the Allocation Policy has contained <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;suitability criteria&#8221;</span>, against which caseworkers are required to assess an individual asylum seeker&#8217;s suitability to receive support under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref> in the form of accommodation at an ex-MoD site, including Wethersfield.</p>

The changes to the suitability criteria made on publication of versions 10 and 11 of the Allocation Policy relate (amongst other categories) to asylum seekers who are potential victims of modern slavery, to those who would be defined as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;vulnerable&#8221; </span>under regulation 4(3) of the 2005 Regulations and to those with complex health needs including serious mental health issues. It is necessary to set out how those suitability criteria<span style="font-style:italic"/>have changed as each successive version of the Allocation Policy has been promulgated during the period since 12 July 2023.

Application of the <span style="font-style:italic">Tameside </span>principle requires such a system to be in place not only in order reasonably to inform the defendant&#8217;s decision to accommodate an asylum seeker at Wethersfield, but also thereafter to enable his suitability to be monitored and a reasonably informed decision to be made whether to remove him elsewhere.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr McCullough KC submitted on behalf of the consolidated claimants that the accommodation allocation arrangements described in the defendant&#8217;s detailed grounds of defence and in the evidence given on her behalf are deficient, ineffective in their operation and lack the hallmarks of a <span style="font-style:italic">Tameside</span> compliant system for making properly informed decisions about an asylum seeker&#8217;s suitability to be accommodated, or to continue to be accommodated, at Wethersfield. He contended that the deficiency in the allocation arrangements for those purposes is evidenced by the fact that each of the claimants in the consolidated claim was a vulnerable asylum seeker, who was unsuitable to be accommodated at Wethersfield on the application of the suitability criteria in effect at the date of the allocation decision in their case. Nevertheless, each had been wrongly accommodated at Wethersfield, initially under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/98" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 98</ref> but subsequently under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>, primarily because the defendant&#8217;s allocations procedures did not provide an effective, <span style="font-style:italic">Tameside </span>compliant system to obtain the information needed to assess them properly against the suitability criteria.</p>

In order to discharge that duty in a <span style="font-style:italic">Tameside </span>compliant way, it was incumbent on the defendant to operate an allocations process which not only enabled caseworkers to identify individual asylum seekers who were unsuitable for accommodation at Wethersfield on the application of the suitability criteria, but also such a person who was properly to be judged as unsuitable by reason of his individual needs notwithstanding those criteria. MJ had been such a person, as a result of the deficiencies in the defendant&#8217;s accommodation allocation procedures, he had been wrongly accommodated at Wethersfield until relocated pursuant to the order of McGowan J on 6 March 2024.</p>

Fifthly, the principle that the decision-maker must call his own attention to considerations relevant to his decision, a duty which in practice may require him to consult outside bodies with a particular knowledge or involvement in the case, does not spring from a duty of procedural fairness to the applicant but rather from the Secretary of States duty so to inform himself as to arrive at a rational conclusion.

As I have explained, the defendant&#8217;s witnesses place considerable reliance on the screening interview process and the current content of the questionnaire as the basis for a reasonable system of gathering information for initial decisions about accommodating asylum seekers. The defendant requires each asylum seeker to complete a questionnaire shortly after arrival in the UK. Where a decision is made to transfer an asylum seeker to Wethersfield, the evidence is that the asylum seeker&#8217;s suitability for accommodation at that site is based primarily on the information which he gives in response to the questionnaire during his screening interview. </p>

The evidential basis for that finding is set out in [197]-[204] of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">NB</span>. In summary, the screening interview process in that case had been truncated and lasted typically fifteen to eighteen minutes in each case. Part 3 of the questionnaire which asked for information about the asylum seeker&#8217;s travel history, including &#8220;Why have you come to the UK?&#8221; had been omitted. In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R (DA) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2020/3080" uk:canonical="[2020] EWHC 3080 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWHC 3080 (Admin)</ref> Fordham J had made an order that Part 3 be restored to the screening interview, as the questions posed were key to discovering evidence that the applicant was a potential victim of trafficking at the screening stage.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position is different now. The evidence in the present case establishes that the questionnaire requires an asylum seeker to provide information about his health in answer to questions under Part 2; about his journey to the UK in answer to questions under Part 3; and in Part 6, to provide information about any factors of which the defendant needs to be aware when allocating accommodation to him, so as to ensure that the accommodation is suitable and adequate for his needs. Part 6 of the questionnaire specifically requires the asylum seeker to inform the interviewing officer whether he is disabled or has experienced torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence. The screening interview based on each asylum seeker having the opportunity to provide information in response to these and other questions posed in the questionnaire is expected to last about forty five minutes.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In summary, the evidence is that the defendant added Part 6 to the questionnaire for the purpose of gathering information from asylum seekers to enable caseworkers in the NAAU to assess their suitability for accommodation at Wethersfield, pending a decision on providing accommodation to meet their needs under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>.

The questions which an asylum seeker is now required to answer in completing his ASF1 form at Wethersfield are a reasonable system for gathering the information reasonably required to enable the defendant to make a decision as to whether he is suitable for accommodation at Wethersfield under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>, applying the suitability criteria in the Allocation Policy.

The claimants&#8217; evidence includes wide ranging and trenchant criticisms of the monitoring arrangements in place at the site.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, the relevant question is whether the monitoring arrangements described by Ms Mascurine are so deficient as a system, that they are incapable of enabling the defendant to obtain the information which she reasonably requires for the purpose of determining whether asylum seekers at Wethersfield remain suitable to be accommodated there, by reference to the suitability criteria in the Allocation Policy. I am satisfied that is not the position. The system provides for regular welfare and safeguarding checks on individual asylum seekers by the welfare team. The welfare team are given general training on mental health awareness and safeguarding. They are made aware of the suitability criteria and the current Allocation Policy. Welfare checks and the responses to standard questions are recorded. That provides information upon the basis of which welfare officers are able to communicate concerns about an asylum seeker&#8217;s suitability to remain accommodated at Wethersfield directly to the HOAT, which is headed by the SRO. The same line of communication is in place to enable the welfare team to report an asylum seeker as a potential victim of modern slavery. The on-site medical team are aware of the suitability criteria and are able to raise concerns about asylum seekers&#8217; suitability to remain at the site. Subject to the asylum seeker&#8217;s consent, the medical team is able to report medical information to HOAT in support of their concern. The role of the Large Sites Team in assessing referrals under the Large Sites SOP, which gives guidance on the procedures for processing requests for relocation, provides further assurance that on referral (including self-referral or referral by the asylum seeker&#8217;s representatives), an asylum seeker&#8217;s suitability to remain at the site will be assessed on the basis of the suitability criteria.</p>

In the case of the three claimants who bring the consolidated claim, that contention is primarily rooted in the submission that the defendant failed properly to apply the suitability criteria in her Allocation Policy in judging them to be suitable to be accommodated at Wethersfield and so failed to discharge her statutory duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>. The case advanced on behalf of MJ is that he was an asylum seeker whose individual needs rendered him unsuitable to be accommodated at Wethersfield, even if those needs did not necessarily fall within the scope of the suitability criteria promulgated in the Allocation Policy. In adhering too strictly to those policy criteria, it was submitted, the defendant had lost sight of MJ&#8217;s individual vulnerability which should have led the defendant, acting reasonably, to decide that accommodation at Wethersfield was not adequate to meet his needs. None of these arguments raises a systemic issue. They are instead focused upon the legality of decisions made by the defendant in respect of each of the individual claimants. I shall address each of those individual claims later. </p>

On-site healthcare is operated from the medical centre at Wethersfield. The medical centre is staffed by a medical team which includes at least two general practitioners, an advanced nurse practitioner, a general nurse, a mental health nurse, and two health care assistants. The medical centre provides the following services to residents: (i) medical health screening for residents on arrival; (ii) an immunisation programme; (iii) provision of prescribed medications; (iv) treatment for minor illnesses and injuries; (v) a low-level trauma-informed mental health support service; (vi) confidential health advice; (vii) emergency dental care; and (viii) eye tests. Where an asylum seeker accommodated at Wethersfield requires care beyond that which can be provided by the on-site medical centre, he will be referred for the appropriate specialist care. In this way residents at Wethersfield are able to access the same healthcare facilities as other residents of Mid Essex. Transport is provided to take residents to and from off-site medical appointments.</p>

The rules on registering with a GP are the same as in the rest of the country, namely they can register at any practice with an open list whose catchment boundaries include Wethersfield. However, in practical terms, it is likely to be significantly easier for those accommodated at Wethersfield to gain access to medical services at the on-site medical centre, which has the added advantage of being equipped with facilities (such as access to interpreters) which mean that it may be better able to support asylum seekers. </p>

They can also assist with the transfer of information from residents to the Home Office on-site service providers.

BRC were told by the onsite healthcare team that 10% of asylum seekers they saw had suicidal ideation, which BRC considered may be an underestimate.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The defendant contends that the healthcare, welfare and support services available to residents at Wethersfield as described by Mr Butler cannot be characterised as inadequate. Although the BRC report has raised strong concerns about a culture of disbelief amongst staff and a lack of effective safeguarding of residents, the MTC report had found the welfare team to be well led and to display high levels of motivation and a keenness to support those in their care. The MTC report had made recommendations for a more integrated approach to enable them to provide more than a basic level of service. Mr Butler himself had instructed MTC to report in the light of the concerns raised by the ICIBI in correspondence in later 2023 and early 2024. In his witness statement Mr Butler explains that in response to MTC&#8217;s recommendations, the Home Office and CRH have taken steps to improve the induction process, provide more enrichment activities for residents, and install better Wi-Fi service and consider improvements to the roles of security and welfare staff. Discussions were taking place with Commisceo in relation to information sharing arrangements.</p>

Mr Butler says that the defendant operates a policy of zero tolerance of bullying, harassment or abuse of any nature, including racially motivated behaviour of that kind. Residents are informed of this policy following their arrival at the site and during the induction process; and in the terms of the occupancy agreement. Mr Butler's evidence is that violent and aggressive incidents between residents at the site are generally the result of disagreements and personal animosity; and not caused by tension between cultural or racial groups. Home Office and CRH staff are trained on diversity and inclusion, bullying, harassment and abuse. Mr Butler describes the role of security officers in maintaining good order at the site. His operational judgment as SRO is that no specific safeguarding measures are needed to prevent and manage the risk of racial violence and harassment at the site.</p>

Nevertheless, the defendant points out that in commissioning the reports and responding to their findings, the Home Office is able to learn lessons and to assess and improve the operation of the site. In other words, the findings and recommendations of the reports, both those produced by the ICIBI under statutory powers and those produced on commission by MTC and BRC, form part of the means whereby the defendant seeks to ensure that asylum accommodation at Wethersfield continues to be adequate to meet the needs of asylum seekers accommodated there under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>.</p>

It is understandable that asylum seekers accommodated at Wethersfield grow unhappy with aspects of their living conditions at the site. Room sharing over a period of up to nine months with strangers is an understandable source of unhappiness. It is easy to see how the relative isolation of the site could cause discontentment. There is evidence that the arrangements for mealtimes have been difficult to manage and led to disruption, including outbreaks of violence on occasions. The monotony and boredom of daily life for those accommodated at the site is understandable, and a particular cause for concern voiced in the independent reports.</p>

By virtue of regulation 13(2) of the 2000 Regulations, the asylum seeker&#8217;s personal preference as to the nature of the accommodation provided to him is to be left out of account, as is his preference as to the nature and standard of fixtures and fittings. Regulation 14 authorises the defendant to provide education, including English language lessons, and sporting or other developmental activities to persons receiving asylum support, but <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;only for the purpose of maintaining good order among such persons&#8221;</span>.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When considered in the context of the statutory arrangements and the Allocation Policy, in my view, the alleged inherent inadequacies in the accommodation arrangements at Wethersfield advanced by the claimants have been satisfactorily addressed by the defendant. Room sharing is far from ideal as a sleeping arrangement, but it is not necessarily inconsistent with a subsistence level of accommodation, even for a relatively prolonged period of up to nine months. The relative isolation of the site is reasonably accommodated through the provision of shuttle bus services. The security arrangements at the gate do not unreasonably interfere with asylum seeker&#8217;s freedom of movement to and from the site. The need for them is satisfactorily explained by the defendant in evidence. It is reasonable for the defendant to take the view that the presence of the existing perimeter fencing does not result in &#8220;prison-like&#8221; accommodation that is necessarily inadequate for asylum seekers accommodated there on the basis of her Allocation Policy. Nor is it unreasonable to fence off the accommodation from other areas of the former airfield which present dangers to trespassers. The defendant has taken steps to improve the management of queues and the risk of disorder arising at set mealtimes. Medical and health services are provided at the site. I see no good reason to doubt the defendant&#8217;s assertion that the level of healthcare provision available to asylum seekers accommodated at the site is in line with the provision of NHS facilities generally. Welfare and support services are available at the site. The site does provide recreational activities and a dedicated place of worship.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, I do not accept that the conditions of accommodation provided for asylum seekers at Wethersfield as described in the evidence before the court have been shown to be so deficient as to be incapable of providing adequate accommodation for asylum seekers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>. In my view, the defendant does not act irrationally in judging that the accommodation arrangements provided for asylum seekers at Wethersfield are able to provide support to asylum seekers accommodated there in accordance with the Allocation Policy at least to the level of subsistence. For that reason, the defendant is not in breach of her statutory duty arising under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 95</ref> and 96 of IAA 1999 and regulation 5 of the 2005 Regulations in providing accommodation for asylum seekers at Wethersfield.

The classes of person include those who would be defined as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;vulnerable&#8221;</span> under regulation 4 of the 2005 Regulations and those with complex health needs within the terms of paragraph 4.16 of the Healthcare Needs and Dispersal Policy (which includes individuals with certain serious mental health issues).</p>

Regulation 5(2) requires the defendant to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;have regard&#8221; </span>to the special needs of an asylum seeker who is a vulnerable person, when considering whether to provide support for that person under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> or 98 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>. In that context, the classes of vulnerability include disabled persons and persons who have been subjected to torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence. However, in order to understand clearly the extent of the duty placed on the defendant by regulation 4(2), it is important to understand that it is dependent upon the person&#8217;s special needs having been confirmed by an individual evaluation of his situation. Moreover, regulation 4(4) makes clear that the defendant is under no obligation herself to carry out or to arrange for such an evaluation for the purpose of confirming whether the person does have special needs by virtue of his disability or being the victim of serious violence.</p>

Under versions 11 and 12, she fulfils that duty by regarding such a person as potentially unsuitable for accommodation at Wethersfield, the matter to be decided in each case on the basis of the ability of the site to meet his confirmed special needs.</p>

She says that version 11 introduced the new section headed <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Individual evaluation of special needs for those who meet criteria which may make them unsuitable&#8221;</span> to mitigate against the risk that individual asylum seekers may abuse the system by making unsubstantiated claims of being unsuitable, which might frustrate the defendant&#8217;s policy objective of reducing reliance on hotels to provide <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 95</ref> accommodation and so lessen the overall cost of accommodating asylum seekers.</p>

That provision clearly envisages a case-by-case approach to consideration of an applicant asylum seeker&#8217;s special needs; and rests upon confirmation being given to the defendant of those special needs which result from the applicant&#8217;s disability or his exposure to serious violence of the kind described in regulation 4(3) of the 2005 Regulations.</p>

The defendant&#8217;s duty to take such steps to inform herself as are reasonable is not breached by promulgating policy guidance which founds upon practical application of regulation 4 of the 2005 Regulations, for the purposes of enabling her to have regard to an applicant&#8217;s special needs.</p>

I have already concluded that in their current form, both the questionnaire and the ASF1 are sufficient to gather the information which the defendant reasonably requires to enable her to comply with her duty of reasonable inquiry in making decisions under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref>, 96 and 98 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>. As was submitted by the defendant, the basic thrust of the Allocation Policy has been consistent throughout successive versions, that caseworkers should assess an asylum seeker&#8217;s suitability to be accommodated at Wethersfield on a case-by-case basis, having regard to each individual&#8217;s needs and all the available evidence, but specifically the screening interview and the completed ASF1 form. The new guidance which sits in the context of regulation 4 of the 2005 Regulations does not affect that conclusion. Finally, the claimants&#8217; complaint about unpublished operating procedures adds nothing to their argument, which is based on the published version 11 of the Allocation Policy.</p>

On the contrary, the new guidance provides advice to caseworkers on the information which they should expect to be provided to enable the defendant to apply the suitability criteria against the relevant statutory framework set by regulation 4 of the 2005 Regulations. As I have explained, regulation 4 is founded upon the defendant inquiring into information which has been provided to her by or on behalf of the applicant for the purpose of taking account of his special needs. </p>

It is not unlawful for the defendant to give policy guidance to caseworkers on the relative weight which she expects to give to different categories of evidence. Had the policy guidance advised caseworkers that in the absence of supporting documentation from support services or verifiable expert or professional healthcare practitioners, the applicant is suitable for accommodation at Wethersfield, its lawfulness might be open to question as being too rigid an approach to case-by-case decision making. But that is not what the guidance says. The guidance advises caseworkers that the absence of supporting evidence from such sources <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;carries less weight and should not generally be accepted alone&#8221; </span>as evidence of unsuitability. In other words, unsupported documentation may still carry some weight and may in the given case be judged to be sufficient to justify the conclusion that the applicant is unsuitable for accommodation at Wethersfield.

It may be necessary in appropriate cases for caseworkers to take a precautionary approach in the light of the evidence which the applicant is able to produce at his screening interview (for example, medication or his physical condition). The new guidance does not preclude such an approach. On the contrary, each case is to be considered on the basis of all the available evidence. It is necessary to have in mind that the claimants&#8217; case under this ground is systemic. As the Supreme Court said in <span style="font-style:italic">R(A)</span>, that a policy is able to operate lawfully leaves open the opportunity to argue that it has not in fact been applied lawfully to the facts of the given case.</p>

As the evidence before the court in the present claims shows, in such cases applicants are generally able to seek supporting evidence from a range of support services, including medical practitioners and other professionals. </p>

In the pre-allocation stage, some individuals arrive in the UK with medical notes and prescriptions, which would be considered. Some disabilities or health conditions are apparent without the need for medical records, such as mobility impairments. Once allocated, any evidence from on-site medical services as well as other professional evidence, such as from off-site clinicians or NGOs who are supporting individuals, will be considered along with all information held about the individual and their specific needs.</span></p>

Accordingly, no allocation decision is final and suitability is monitored on an ongoing basis. So, if information later comes to light about a specific need that an individual accommodated at Wethersfield has which cannot be met on-site, the [Allocation Policy] ensures that this evidence is considered and the individual is moved off site.&#8221;</span></p>

Unlawfulness in such cases is said to arise in two respects.

Secondly, it is said that the guidance introduces a practice which inevitably results in delay in the defendant&#8217;s determination of the asylum seeker&#8217;s suitability to be accommodated at Wethersfield, in circumstances where there will already be verifiable and professional supporting evidence for his special needs and the inability of those special needs to be met at the site.</p>

The policy guidance, however, is not that caseworkers should refer cases to HOMA or HOPA advisers as a matter of routine. It is that they should consider whether such a referral is required in the given case. Although by no means every case is likely to merit referral, there will be cases in which it is reasonable for the caseworker to seek the opinion of a HOMA or HOPA adviser in order to inform the defendant&#8217;s determination of the asylum seeker&#8217;s suitability for Wethersfield. In such cases, some delay is the inevitable consequence of that referral. Whether referral in the given case has resulted in unjustifiable delay in the removal of an asylum seeker from unsuitable accommodation at Wethersfield, is a potential ground for challenge on the basis that the new policy guidance has been unlawfully applied in the circumstances of that case. </p>

As I have said, in her evidence on behalf of the defendant, Ms Stratton expresses the same view. She relies upon the Policy EIA for that assessment, which she also says was considered by ministers in deciding to bring in that change to the Allocation Policy published under version 11 on 12 February 2024.</p>

The Policy EIA, which is said to have been conducted to assess the impact of the proposed policy changes later given effect in version 11 of the Allocation Policy, simply did not make that assessment. I have set out above the relevant extracts from the Policy EIA. The focus of the assessment carried out in the Policy EIA was evidently on the policy change made by version 10 of the Allocation Policy, in relation to the change in approach to the suitability of potential victims of modern slavery to be accommodated at Wethersfield. Insofar as that assessment considered the impact on disabled persons, it did so on the basis that under the Allocation Policy, large accommodation sites (including Wethersfield) would not be used to accommodate those who have complex health needs including mental disabilities; and that individuals with mental impairments were not considered suitable for such accommodation and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;will not be housed at these sites&#8221;</span>. The assessment stated that the suitability criteria in the Allocation Policy <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;will ensure&#8221; </span>that asylum seekers who are considered as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;not suitable&#8221; </span>for such sites will not be moved to them.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Policy EIA makes no attempt to assess the equalities implications of the change in policy which was then proposed, the effect of which was that asylum seekers who were disabled or had serious mental health issues may henceforth be judged to be suitable for accommodation at Wethersfield provided that their special needs were able to be met at the site. That is a most serious and inexplicable omission, particularly in the light of Ms Stratton&#8217;s evidence that the Policy EIA was prepared and submitted for ministers&#8217; consideration precisely to enable the equalities impacts of that significant change in policy to be considered. It amounts to the clearest failure on the part of the defendant to fulfil the PSED. This is not a case in which the question is whether the Policy EIA properly fulfils the defendant&#8217;s duty to have due regard to the statutory objectives in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27/section/149" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 149</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27" uk:canonical="2010 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">EA 2010</ref>.  In this case, the only conclusion I am able to reach on evidence is that the defendant did not attempt to assess the equalities impacts of the proposed policy change later promulgated under version 11. That remains the factual position, since there was no subsequent assessment of the policy change when it was carried forward into the current version 12 of the Allocation Policy.</p>

It is of particular importance the policy maker has a proper appreciation of those impacts if the substance of the policy is to be formulated with due regard to the three statutory equality objectives. To take an obvious example, the concerns raised by the claimants and many others as to the practical challenges of assessing whether the special needs of disabled or mentally impaired asylum seekers who have recently arrived in the UK can properly be met at Wethersfield plainly has potential equalities impacts. Ministers were advised that operational colleagues had been closely involved in the development of the Allocation Policy to ensure proposed change of policy could be implemented at pace. The Policy EIA made no attempt to assess the measures which were then proposed to achieve that objective and how effective those measures might be in advancing the interests of asylum seekers with special needs arising from protected characteristics, who under the then current Allocation Policy, version 10, were not considered suitable to be accommodated at Wethersfield.

It is important to distinguish between a PPP and the adjustments made to a PPP to alleviate the detrimental effects to which a disabled person may be subjected by it. The PPP represents the base position before adjustments are made to accommodate disabilities. It includes all practices and procedures which apply to everyone, but excludes the adjustments. The adjustments are the steps which a service provider or public authority takes in discharge of its statutory duty to change the PPP. By definition, therefore, the PPP does not include the adjustments. In the present context, a PPP will exclude the use of BSL interpreters in order to improve communication with deaf persons in the conduct of police searches of premises. It will also exclude the use of lip reading and sign language by trained police officers, because these measures too are adopted to alleviate the detriment that would otherwise be suffered by deaf persons&#8221;.</span></p>

By introducing suitability criteria which contemplate that mentally disabled asylum seekers within the identified class may be considered to be suitable for accommodation at Wethersfield, subject to an assessment whether their special needs can be met at the site, the defendant is said to have failed to take steps to avoid the disadvantage to the identified class of disabled persons. The objective of the duty is to avoid substantial disadvantage in anticipation of its occurrence. By adopting a case-by-case approach to whether persons within the identified class are suitable to be accommodated at Wethersfield, the defendant has in fact accepted that such disadvantage may result.</p>

Indeed that will be so in most cases where a positive reasonable grounds decision is subsequently made: if the case crossed the credible suspicion threshold when considered by the Competent Authority it will also have done so at the point when it was referred. Accordingly the Secretary of State will have come under the protection duty under article 4 some time before the Competent Authority makes its decision. It should be noted that the designation of the Competent Authority under the UK system &#8211; whether it be the UKHTC or part of the Home Office &#8211; is a purely domestic construct: the Court in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Rantsev</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#160;and&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Chowdhury</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#160;refers simply to "the State authorities", which would embrace front-line staff as much as the authorities further up the chain of referral.</span></p>

Ms Stratton acknowledged that the time taken in practice for referrals into the NRM to reach a reasonable grounds decision were taken into account in the advice to ministers.

The question is whether the defendant&#8217;s policy under version 10 and subsequent versions of the Allocation Policy that such potential victims of trafficking are nevertheless suitable in principle for asylum accommodation at Wethersfield is in breach of her protection duty and so in contravention of article 4 of the ECHR.</p>

There is no evidence to support the logic of the claimants&#8217; argument, that to accommodate potential victims of slavery or trafficking at Wethersfield prior to a reasonable grounds decision inevitably exposes such persons to a risk of further exploitation which being accommodated elsewhere under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref> would avoid. Nor does the change of policy necessarily result in such persons for whom accommodation at Wethersfield is unsuited to their needs by virtue of their experience of slavery or trafficking being accommodated there. The suitability criteria in version 12 of the Allocation Policy apply to such persons in cases where they have special needs as vulnerable persons or complex health needs, including serious mental health issues.

It is consistent with the performance of the defendant&#8217;s duty to take reasonable steps to protect such persons in accordance with the protection duty arising under article 4 of the ECHR. Unsurprisingly, the Allocation Policy does not purport to give a comprehensive account of the defendant&#8217;s duty of protection under article 4. It reflects and is consistent with the statutory guidance on providing appropriate accommodation to support such persons promulgated pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2015/30/section/49" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 49</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2015/30" uk:canonical="2015 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Modern Slavery Act 2015</ref>. </p>

It was said that the system for identifying potential victims was defective and likely to lead to such persons being accommodated at Wethersfield even though they in fact merit a positive reasonable grounds decision in their favour.</p>

In any event, having considered the claimants&#8217; submissions in those paragraphs, they do not affect the essential issue which arises under this ground. This ground essentially founds on the proposition that in order to discharge her duty of protection under article 4 of the ECHR, as that duty has been explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Rantsev</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">TDT</span>, the defendant must revert to her policy in version 9 of the Allocation Policy. She must treat any asylum seeker who is a potential victim of slavery or trafficking as unsuitable to be accommodated at Wethersfield. For the reasons I have given, I do not consider that her duty of protection under article 4 of the ECHR impels the defendant to reinstate that former policy. In my judgment, her current policy following the change of approach introduced in version 10 of the Allocation Policy is in accordance with her duty of protection. She has not put herself in breach of article 4. </p>

He says that he is aware that this issue has also been raised in the ICIBI correspondence and the MTC Report. He says that the defendant operates a zero tolerance approach to racially motivated bullying, harassment and abuse. This is made clear during the induction process when new residents arrive at Wethersfield. An inclusive atmosphere is encouraged. To help newly arrived asylum seekers to settle in, the policy is to try to accommodate them in the same rooms or adjacent to rooms occupied by persons who share languages in common. However, residents are encouraged to mix with each other and are able to move freely throughout the site. Welfare and security checks are carried out on newly arrived asylum seekers to ensure that they are settling in well. The policy is to enable residents who want to share with friends to do so.</p>

My view, both from first hand experience on-site and from reviewing incident reports is that incidents involving aggression and violence between residents are usually caused by disagreements and personal animosity between two (or sometimes three) individual residents, rather than tensions or aggressions between cultural or racial groups. Certainly, I have observed that residents with a common background, language or culture tend to gravitate towards each other and to form a friendship groups, but it is not been my perception that particular groups are in conflict with each other.</span></p>

The perpetrator was already known to staff on site and the Police because he was part of a small group that was behaving anti-socially. This was being actively managed by both CRH and the Police. The group&#8217;s behaviour did improve after interactions with the Police, who had issued warning letters and had made one arrest.

I'm not aware of any such advice having been given at any time. I've spoken to a CRH site manager, who also was not aware of any such advice having been given, and who told me that he did not believe it is the kind of thing that a welfare officer would say. Further, the Claimants say that after this incident advice given by contractors implicitly acknowledged that Black African residents did not have safe and equal access to common areas, activities and services.

This is already in place at Napier, and it appears to be working effectively there. I hope that this will encourage residents to complain whenever they experience issues with other residents and staff, and to fully engage with the investigation process thereafter. The induction process is the subject of ongoing improvements, as set out elsewhere in this statement.

Here, the EIA acknowledged that there was a risk of tensions arising between different ethnic groups accommodated that the site. Where fulfilment of the PSED requires a public authority to carry out an assessment of the risk of prohibited activity or behaviour arising, the evaluation of the degree of that risk is quintessentially a matter for the informed judgement of that authority. Provided that the risk assessment is properly informed and reasonable, there is no basis for questioning whether the public authority has fulfilled their duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27/section/149" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 149</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27" uk:canonical="2010 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">EA 2010</ref>.</p>

There is a wide mix of different national and ethnic groups amongst the asylum seekers accommodated at Wethersfield. It is not suggested that accommodating persons of Black African ethnicity at the site in itself resulted in a breach of the PSED. When read in the light of Mr Butler&#8217;s evidence to which I have referred above, it seems to me that the evaluation of the level of risk of racial harassment to asylum seekers sharing the protected characteristic of race as low but that there was a risk of tensions between ethnic groups, is reasonably founded on the evidence. As I have said, Mr Butler&#8217;s evidence is that incidents involving aggression and violence between residents are usually caused by disagreements and personal animosity between individuals, rather than tension or aggression between cultural or racial groups. He was not cross examined on his evidence. Perceptions will differ, but I see no reason to doubt that Mr Butler&#8217;s assessment of the position was reasonable,  speaking as the SRO at Wethersfield.</p>

The operational response to the particular incidents upon which the claimants rely is consistent with that. How such monitoring is undertaken is again a matter for the reasonable operational judgment of the defendant. Mr Butler&#8217;s evidence is that incidents which are or may be racially motivated are recorded as such and appropriate action is taken to resolve them. The incident tracker is closely monitored for incidents which may suggest a racial motive. He acknowledges that it may be necessary to reassess whether any additional steps need to be taken. He also acknowledges that there is room for improvement in complaints handling and in staff training.<span style="font-style:italic"/>In the light of Mr Butler&#8217;s evidence, I am unable to accept that the monitoring of actual or potential incidents of racial harassment and other prohibited conduct at Wethersfield bears out the claimants&#8217; contentions. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The defendant now accepts that the information given by TG at his screening interview on 21 August 2023 should have led to his being referred then into the NRM as a potential victim of trafficking; and being found not to be suitable to be accommodated at Wethersfield. Those concessions are plainly correct. At that time, version 9 of the Allocation Policy was in operation. On the simple application of the suitability criteria then in effect, as at least a potential victim of trafficking, TG was not suitable for transfer to Wethersfield. The defendant does not suggest that she had any reason to depart from that suitability criteria in deciding whether to transfer TG to Wethersfield under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/98" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 98</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>, or to continue to accommodate him there under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of IAA 1999. Nor does she contend that the position changed following the publication of version 10 of the Allocation Policy on 9 October 2023. Again, that is consistent with her having made a positive reasonable grounds decision in favour of TG on the same date.</p>

In my view, it is an implausible view of TG&#8217;s situation, given that Dr Beek&#8217;s report provides clear evidence of a deterioration in TG&#8217;s mental health which had set in well before she saw him on 8 October 2023. Her description of his current situation attests to the fact that TG had already begun to develop symptoms of PTSD and depression long before that date. In my view, TG&#8217;s presentation to Dr Beeks as recorded in her unchallenged report is consistent with his claim that his mental health began to deteriorate following his arrival at the site in late August 2023. I find that TG was suffering from a disability which satisfied the definition in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27" uk:canonical="2010 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">EA 2010</ref> throughout the period of his accommodation at Wethersfield. On the basis of Dr Beek&#8217;s report, I also find that TG&#8217;s PTSD and associated depression substantially affected his ability to carry out day-to-day activities, an impact that was likely to be prolonged over the period of his recovery following his removal from the site on 20 November 2023.</p>

She would have been in a position to take reasonable steps to avoid that risk eventuating as it in fact did. As the defendant concedes, had she not overlooked TG&#8217;s history of being violently trafficked which he stated at his screening interview and in his ASF1 form, she would have considered him not to be suitable for accommodation at Wethersfield. In short, due to oversight, the defendant failed to make the reasonable adjustment in favour of TG for which she had provided in her Allocation Policy, in anticipation of fulfilling her duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27/section/29/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 29(7)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27" uk:canonical="2010 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">EA 2010</ref> in relation to an asylum seeker reporting TG&#8217;s history of trafficking and exploitation.

The defendant is not in a position to speculate on how the on-site medical team might have sought to alleviate TG&#8217;s symptoms; or whether his case might have been referred to a HOMA or HOPA expert for review. There is no evidence before the court which calls into question Dr Beeks&#8217; contemporaneous diagnosis of TG&#8217;s symptoms following her examination of him. Nor is there any evidence upon which to call into question her prognosis of continuing deterioration in his mental health unless he was relocated from accommodation at the site. There is no substance in the defendant&#8217;s argument that she might have made adjustments which reasonably enabled him to remain at the site, notwithstanding its harmful and disabling impact on his mental health which is evident from Dr Beek&#8217;s contemporary report.</p>

Applying the approach stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Anufrijeva</span>, I am unable to conclude that his being required to live in unsuitable accommodation for his needs for that relatively short period was so serious and prolonged an interference with his rights, and of so severe a degree as to be comparable to inhuman or degrading treatment.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">MN is a 31-year-old Afghan national. His account in his witness statements of his journey to the UK may be summarised as follows. He was in the police force in Afghanistan prior to the Taliban coming to power. He fled the country shortly thereafter in November 2021. He travelled to Iran, where he says he remained for around three and a half months, during which time he was detained by smugglers, beaten and held captive. He was forced to call his family and ask for a ransom to be paid for his release. In early 2022 he was marched across the border into Turkey. Initially he was found by the local police, beaten and returned to Iran. Shortly thereafter, he made his way back into Turkey and travelled to Istanbul where he found work in a restaurant. However, he says that his work there was forced labour. He was exploited and when he asked for his wages, the owner of the restaurant refused to pay him and threatened to report him to the police as an illegal migrant. He says that he left Turkey due to his exploitation and constant fear of being arrested and deported back to Afghanistan. He made his way to Croatia where he was arrested, beaten and for a short period detained in very difficult conditions. He then travelled across mainland Europe, arriving by small boat in the UK on 8 July 2023. On arrival he claimed asylum.</p>

The record of his screening interview in the completed questionnaire records that MN&#8217;s screening interview was conducted in Dari. His questionnaire records that he had been a police officer in Afghanistan for three and a half years who left under threats from the Taliban. His journey to the UK is recorded as being via Iran, Turkey, Croatia and thence across Europe to France and the UK. He had targeted England as the country in which he wished to stay. He has a brother in the UK. In answer to the question <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Have you ever been detained, either in the UK or in any other country for any reason?&#8221; </span>he responded that he had been detained for one night in Croatia for illegal entry.

MN says that he can understand and speak some Farsi but is not fluent in that language. He says that there were two changes of interpreter during the course of the interview, with the third interpreter telling MN to keep his answers short so that they could understand each other better. He says that he remembers being asked when and why he left Afghanistan and about his journey from Afghanistan to the UK. He says that because of the advice of the third interpreter, he felt unable to go into detail about what had happened to him in Iran, Turkey and Croatia. He accepts that he was asked about his state of physical and mental health. He says that when he arrived in the UK he felt that his mental health was fine and so gave that response during his screening interview.</p>

He says that when he first arrived at Wethersfield he was quite social. He made some friends and played football. However, from the beginning of November 2023, he says that he became more withdrawn and spent his days in his room simply waiting for each day to end. He says that he continued to go to the mosque to pray but began to experience negative thoughts. He had been told that he would not be required to stay at Wethersfield for longer than two to three months. He was aware that many men who had arrived at the site later than him had already been moved on. This gave him a sense of despair and he became increasingly ashamed and irritable. He went out on the shuttle bus once or twice a week as he found it made him feel better to see people leading normal lives. Nevertheless, he became very lonely.</p>

On 14 December 2023, he had a consultation with Dr Gosslau of Doctors of the World. The letter summarised his account of his traumatic experiences in the course of his journey from Afghanistan to the UK. Dr Gosslau reported that MN&#8217;s mental health had deteriorated during his time at Wethersfield, he had lost weight, was sleeping badly and suffering from flashbacks and nightmares. Dr Gosslau assessed MN as suffering from severe mental distress but that he denied any formed suicidal plans. The recommendation was that MN should complete his course of anti-depressants and seek a review with a GP at the site shortly before he did so. Dr Gosslau&#8217;s letter was sent to the on-site healthcare team. </p>

In my clinical opinion, his symptoms are having a substantial adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. MN also reported feeling anxious and fearful about the fights that break out between other residents and has been isolating himself as a result.

I believe a further deterioration in his mental health without access to appropriate mental health support may result in an increase to his risk of death or serious harm by suicide and risk of acting out impulsively in response to his distress causing him unintentional harm.</span></p>

There is no previous history of suicidal behaviour or any severe self-harming behaviour. The applicant remains under regular review by the on-site medical team and has been variously considered for referral to a mental health support group and has been referred to the local mental health team, after initial decline of the referral. The applicant has reported sleep-walking which is not in itself clear evidence of any psychiatric disability&#8230; The applicant has been, at most, partially compliant with antidepressant medication and appears to be being somewhat impatient around its effects.

All asylum seekers have a higher baseline suicide risk than the general population and the best determinants of higher suicidal risk are previous suicidal behaviour and an active intent and planning. In the applicant's case, this is not the case. However clearly the suicide and self-harm risk needs to be monitored closely and may respond to more intense and ongoing treatment. In my opinion the applicant is receiving appropriate care which would be similar to that in a primary care setting and referred to, for example, a primary care mental health team. There is not evidence of more severe PTSD and I would not consider him to have complex health needs or any particular special needs. My advice would be that the applicant is closely monitored by the on-site medical team and appropriate interventions are implemented as quickly as possible. Reviewing the on-site medical notes does not reveal significant concerns in my view, or any inappropriate or sub-optimal management.</span></p>

That conclusion is not affected by the dispute over whether his screening interview was interpreted in Dari or Farsi. I am satisfied on the basis of MN&#8217;s evidence that he had a sufficient grasp of the questions put to him to be in a position to say more than he did about his experiences on his journey from Afghanistan to the UK. In any event, it is not in issue that he completed his ASF1 with the help of Migrant Help and was in no difficulty in understanding the questions he was required to answer at that time. He did not claim to have any physical or mental health problems, nor did he claim to have been the victim of physical or psychological violence. The defendant was properly able to be satisfied that allocating him to Wethersfield would provide him with adequate accommodation to meet his needs, on the basis of the information available to her at that time. There was no evidence in late July 2023 that MN had any special needs which made him unsuitable to be accommodated at Wethersfield, applying version 9 of the Allocation Policy to his case. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The unexplained reference in his medical notes, following his initial health screening, to his being a victim of torture does not provide a sustainable basis for impugning the lawfulness of the defendant&#8217;s determination that, at that time, accommodation at Wethersfield was adequate to meet his needs. MN made no such claim in completing his ASF1 with the assistance of Migrant Help and asserted no special needs arising from any such history. Indeed, MN&#8217;s own evidence is that when he arrived in the UK he was in a positive frame of mind and felt physically and mentally well. He maintained that positive and healthy outlook during the three months which he had expected to be accommodated at Wethersfield, when he arrived at the site in mid-July 2023. He was clearly in a reasonably well-balanced frame of mind during the early period of his stay at Wethersfield. He was a former police officer. I am unable to accept that had he experienced ill-treatment during his journey which amounted to torture, he would have omitted to mention that fact when completing his ASF1 form.</p>

He wanted to get on with building a new life in the UK and was increasingly frustrated at his situation in late 2023 and early 2024.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have said, he was moved to alternative asylum accommodation on 23 February 2024. The reasons which the defendant subsequently gave for her decision to move him show that she did so on a straightforward application of the suitability criteria in the Allocation Policy. She was no longer satisfied that accommodation at Wethersfield was adequate for his needs, since he had produced an individual evaluation which evidenced special needs and a medical condition which could not be managed and supported adequately at the site. The individual evaluation upon which the defendant based that judgment was Dr Pethania&#8217;s psychological report submitted on 15 February 2024.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In explaining her previous determination on 26 January 2024 that MN remained suitable for accommodation at Wethersfield, the defendant said he had not provided evidence of an individual evaluation that would establish that he was vulnerable and/or had special needs for support under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 95</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>. In my view, that deficiency was at least arguably overcome by the submission to the defendant of Dr Pethania&#8217;s letter of 30 January 2024.  Dr Pethania is a clinical psychologist. Her letter stated that she had conducted a psychological assessment of MN during an interview with him on 26 January 2024. Based on that assessment, she had diagnosed MN as suffering from a mental disorder which, she advised, placed him at high risk of further deterioration in his mental health and a reduction in social and occupational functioning if he remained at his current accommodation. She provided a clear explanation for her diagnosis and opinion.</p>

However, in the light of both the explanation which the defendant had given for that determination in her letter of 26 January 2024, her statutory duty under regulation 4(2) of the 2005 Regulations and her stated suitability criteria in version 10 of the Allocation Policy, she was under a legal obligation to give due consideration to Dr Pethania&#8217;s evaluation of MN&#8217;s mental disorder. She was obliged to consider whether there was now a need for a change of accommodation to avoid the worsening of that disorder. Significant new information regarding MN&#8217;s suitability to remain accommodated at Wethersfield had come to light since her decision on 26 January 2024. </p>

That response plainly did not in itself provide an adequate basis to dismiss Dr Pethania&#8217;s diagnosis and professional assessment of MN&#8217;s needs. Dr Pethania had interviewed MN and had the advantage of basing her diagnosis and assessment of his needs on that consultation. Dr Wilson&#8217;s very brief comments in response did not provide a reasonable basis for the defendant to postpone reviewing her earlier decision on the basis of the individual evaluation of MN&#8217;s situation which had now been provided. Indeed, the defendant did not indicate to MN&#8217;s solicitors that she required further information from Dr Pethania or from her own advisers in order to review MN&#8217;s suitability for accommodation at Wethersfield, now that she had the benefit of Dr Pethania&#8217;s individual evaluation of his situation and special needs. In that respect, it is to be noted that although Dr Pethania&#8217;s report submitted on 15 February 2024 provided further detail, her essential diagnosis of MN&#8217;s mental disorder and his special needs remained substantially as reported in her letter of 30 January 2024. </p>

Had she done so, it is reasonable to anticipate that the defendant may have decided that MN was now no longer suitable for accommodation at the site. </p>

She was able to move him to alternative accommodation on the same day. I conclude that, by virtue of regulation 4 of the 2005 Regulations, her stated approach to new information in her Allocation Policy and in the light of her reasons in her letter of 26 January 2024, the defendant had been obliged to review the adequacy of accommodation at Wethersfield to meet MN&#8217;s needs following receipt of Dr Pethania&#8217;s letter of 30 January 2024. The probable consequence of her failure to do so until 23 February 2024 is that MN was accommodated at Wethersfield in breach of the Allocation Policy for a period of up to 25 days. It is not the defendant&#8217;s case that she made a considered decision to depart from the Allocation Policy in MN&#8217;s case during that period. </p>

The defendant contends that MN&#8217;s mental impairment during the period between early December 2023 and his removal from Wethersfield in late February 2024 did not substantially and adversely affect his ability to carry out day-to-day activities. I firmly disagree. The contemporary evidence attests to the fact that the impact of MN&#8217;s progressively depressed state of mind was causing him to be withdrawn and demotivated. He spent long periods in his room. He no longer socialised as he had during his early months at the site. He did not participate as he had in activities at the site. He had become resentful and ill-disposed towards others. These behaviours are indicative of a greater than minor or trivial state of mental impairment. I see no reason to find his account to be feigned or exaggerated. It is supported by much of what is recorded in his contemporary medical notes. That his mood swung to a degree from day-to-day seems to me to be entirely unremarkable, given his circumstances.</p>

I have read Professor Greenberg&#8217;s psychiatric assessment of MN. Professor Greenberg interviewed him on 10 May 2024, two and a half months after he was transferred from Wethersfield into hotel accommodation where he had his own room. Professor Greenberg was able to carry out a detailed review of the relevant documents, including MN&#8217;s medical notes, the letters from Dr Gosslau and Dr Pethania, Dr Pethania&#8217;s report and the advice given by the HOMA. Professor Greenberg&#8217;s opinion was that MN was suffering from a depressive disorder, of which his prolonged period of accommodation at Wethersfield had been the main precipitant. MN&#8217;s depressive disorder had worsened at the site but was currently mild. His anti-depressant medication had proved to be effective over time. He was able to enjoy being out in a local park, he was sleeping and eating well, he was not fatigued and was paying attention to his self-care. He had plans for his future. He reported some social isolation and anxiety about his asylum application. His mobile phone had recently broken. Nevertheless, Professor Greenberg's opinion was that MN was now able to go about his day-to-day activities.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the light of Professor Greenberg&#8217;s opinion, I find that in the weeks following MN&#8217;s removal from Wethersfield, MN&#8217;s depressive disorder subsided in its intensity to the extent that, by mid-May 2024, it had ceased substantially and adversely to affect his ability to carry out his day-to-day activities. Although suffering from a mental impairment which substantially adversely affected his ability to carry out his day-to-day activities during his final weeks at Wethersfield, MN&#8217;s mental health improved and stabilised over the period following his transfer into hotel accommodation. There is insufficient evidence to support a finding that MN was suffering from a mental impairment which was likely substantially and adversely to affect his ability to carry out day-to-day activities in the longer term, for in excess of 12 months. In so finding, I have considered Dr Pethania&#8217;s further report in response to Professor Greenberg&#8217;s report. She had briefly interviewed MN on 3 June 2024. At paragraph 5.4 of her further report, Dr Pethania says that MN&#8217;s current presentation <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;appears to be consistent with Professor Greenberg&#8217;s opinion&#8230;where he diagnosed him with mild depressive disorder&#8221;</span> and at paragraph 6.36 that being accommodated at Wethersfield was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a main stressor for him&#8221;</span>.

He had to do what the agents said. He said that he had suffered a lot in France.

Asked whether he had ever been exploited or had any reason to believe he was going to be exploited, HAA said that he had not. He said that he did not have any physical or mental health issues.</p>

Not only did he clearly report the trauma of seeing members of his immediate family being murdered, but also he had himself fled Somalia under threat of being killed himself by the same terrorist organisation. Moreover, on 1 November 2023 he stated in his ASF1 form that he was struggling at Wethersfield and feeling lonely and isolated for want of any compatriots at the site. He made that report having now lived at Wethersfield for the better part of one month, a clear signal that all was not necessarily well with him.</p>

It is not suggested that his threatened suicide on 27 December 2023 was anything other than genuine. The contemporary reports of his mental state and behaviour which followed up on that incident led to multiple safeguarding referrals and requests that the defendant urgently review his suitability to remain at the site. The correspondence and records drawn to the defendant&#8217;s attention during that period or otherwise available to her prior to 15 January 2024 ought reasonably to have raised serious concern as to whether accommodation at Wethersfield remained adequate to meet HAA&#8217;s individual needs, even to the low legal standard which applies under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>. As I have pointed out, the defendant&#8217;s evidence in response to the systemic challenges places considerable weight on the role of welfare officers at the site in providing her with the information she needs to be able to monitor asylum seeker&#8217;s suitability to remain at the site in accordance with the Allocation Policy. Emphasis is also placed on the role of safeguarding officers for that purpose.</p>

The only indication to them in the defendant&#8217;s letter of 15 January 2024 refusing HAA&#8217;s request for transfer was that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;we have taken into account your issues with your mental health&#8221;</span> and that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;we have had to rely on information provided in your PAP letter&#8221;</span>. Reference was made to a welfare check conducted on 10 January 2024. There was neither reference to nor consideration of the serious concerns raised prior to that date in multiple referrals. The inference is that the report of the welfare check on 10 January 2024 had sufficiently overcome the safeguarding and welfare concerns raised during the period following the incident on 27 December 2023. The letter made no reference to that incident and to HAA&#8217;s threatened suicide attempt.</p>

They are emphatically not questions for this court. However, it is the proper function of this court to examine whether in purporting to answer those questions, the defendant took proper account of all matters which were material to her determination. I have reached the conclusion that on 15 January 2024, the defendant has been shown not to have taken properly into consideration powerful evidence to which she herself, as a matter of policy, attaches primary significance. Had she done so, she might well have reached the conclusion that, applying her Allocation Policy, HAA&#8217;s mental health was under serious strain due to the worsening of his feelings of isolation and anxiety in recent weeks and justified his removal to alternative asylum accommodation. It is striking that Dr Wilson saw HAA&#8217;s evident vulnerabilities as justification enough to advise a low threshold for moving him, irrespective of any formal diagnosis. The adjustment difficulties and isolation in HAA&#8217;s current setting to which Dr Wilson referred should have been just as evident to the defendant when she made her determination on 15 January 2024. There was a body of evidence available to her far in excess of what had been said in the pre-action letter of 21 December 2024.</p>

The letter stated that MJ had suffered a deterioration in his mental health since being accommodated at the site. He had reported depression and anxiety. It was said that MJ had been verbally abused by staff at Wethersfield. A particular incident was referred to on 2 October 2023 in which a security guard had told MJ to go back to his own country. MJ had not felt able to seek assistance for his deteriorating mental health as he had come to distrust staff at the site. It was claimed that MJ was now suffering from &#8220;serious mental health issues&#8221; which were being exacerbated by staff mistreatment and detention like conditions. Wethersfield was not adequate accommodation for his needs. Moreover, the defendant had failed to assess his suitability for accommodation at the site in the light of his deteriorating mental health.

That said, the best determinant of increased suicide risk is previous suicidal behaviour, particularly in the last year; some studies indicate an elevated risk of as much as 100 times if this behaviour has occurred in the past year. In the applicant's case there is no previous history of suicidal behaviour, particularly in the past year. He has only recently commenced antidepressant medication at a low dosage and therefore it would be reasonable to await further review by his GP to assess response to treatment. At present, I would not consider the applicant to be in a high-risk category or to have serious mental health issues given that he is able to otherwise engage in various activities. The applicant clearly finds the current environment stressful, but as laid out in the Home Office response, the applicant is not in an incarcerated setting and there are no curfews in place. He has also been encouraged to engage in normal physical activities and his situation is described as situational which would not typically be most suitable in terms of response to psychotherapy.</span></p>

In his psychiatric report on MJ of 15 May 2024, Professor Greenberg says that he had examined the medical notes of MJ&#8217;s attendance at hospital following the incident on 21 February 2024 and noted that he had received a full CT scan. There was nothing to indicate that MJ had suffered any acute injury from the alleged fall from an upper window.</p>

He stated that any medication he was taking for his mental health was not working because of his continued accommodation at Wethersfield.

In my opinion, it is likely that his worsening adjustment disorder, leading to frustration and increased suicidal thoughts leading to the attempted suicide occurring. It should be noted that research has identified that adjustment disorder is significantly associated with self-harm and suicide in a similar way that depression is associated with self-harm and suicide and that research studies have identified that self-harm and suicide rates are increased in adjustment disorder. In my opinion, he would have benefited from having earlier treatment with antidepressant medication as well as the provision of psychological therapy although this is unlikely to have been effective whilst he was placed at Wethersfield. In my opinion, whilst placed in what he described as a restrictive, overcrowded and distressing environment, where he felt unable to leave and where there were frequent fights would have been distressing, re-traumatising and prevented any therapy from being effective.</span></p>

It was submitted that accommodation which caused an asylum seeker placed there to suffer an evident and significant deterioration in his previously stable mental health could not reasonably have appeared adequate for that person&#8217;s needs. It was further submitted that the defendant had failed to address that question properly on the basis of MJ&#8217;s deteriorating mental health; instead only focusing on whether he fell within the suitability criteria stated in the Allocation Policy.

There is now agreement between the psychiatric experts that being accommodated at Wethersfield precipitated a deterioration in MJ&#8217;s mental health to the extent that he developed a diagnosable mental impairment in the form of an adjustment disorder. His behaviour and symptoms recorded in the contemporary site medical and welfare records appear to be consistent with the onset of that form of mental impairment, as described by Professor Greenberg. That MJ&#8217;s mental health had become unstable became increasingly evident from December 2023 onwards. Although Dr Galappathie subsequently disclaimed the diagnosis of MJ&#8217;s mental disorder presented in his report of 3 January 2024, his report was at least consistent with MJ&#8217;s medical records disclosed to the defendant on 4 January 2024, which evidenced him complaining of stress, suicidal thoughts albeit without active plans, struggling to sleep and feeling depressed. He had been diagnosed by the site GP as suffering from a depressive disorder and been prescribed a course of antidepressants.</p>

Of particular significance, however, was Dr Wilson&#8217;s advice that MJ had only recently begun taking antidepressants and it would be reasonable to await a review of his response to that treatment.

That the reasoning in the defendant&#8217;s letter was rooted in the suitability criteria stated in the Allocation Policy does not indicate that MJ&#8217;s needs were not given proper and individual consideration: the reasoning reflected the fact that the case for MJ&#8217;s removal from the site had been advanced on the basis of the suitability criteria in his pre-action letter of 4 January 2024. </p>

In saying that, I have not lost sight of the incident which occurred on 21 February 2024. The evidence as to precisely how MJ came to be found on the grass outside his accommodation block is unsatisfactory. He himself had no recollection of how he came to be there. I am unable to reach any finding as to whether he did in fact jump from an upper window in an attempted suicide or other act of self-harm. What is clear from the evidence, however, is that there was an immediate and sustained safeguarding response in the period following the incident. MJ&#8217;s state of mental health appears to have fluctuated, perhaps in part because he appears not to have been entirely regular in taking his medication. Nevertheless, the evidence does not support the argument that MJ&#8217;s mental health deteriorated significantly after 24 January 2024 to the degree that the defendant&#8217;s decision of that date was no longer reasonably sustainable.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not consider that MJ&#8217;s case under this ground is substantially assisted by his other complaints about accommodation at Wethersfield. I have rejected the argument that the perimeter fencing and site security arrangements created a prison-like environment. It is notable that there is a good deal of evidence of MJ having taken the opportunity to leave the site quite regularly using the shuttle buses. Indeed he told Professor Greenberg that he had enjoyed his outings. I am unable to attach any significant weight to the alleged incident on 2 October 2023, given the uncertainty over what may have happened. The room sharing arrangements were, in my view, consistent with a subsistence level of adequacy for single adult male asylum seekers&#8217; accommodation provided under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/95" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 95</ref> and 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IAA 1999</ref>. I have accepted that the onsite security arrangements and management response to fighting in the canteen and other outbreaks of violence were a reasonable response to the operational requirements for the site.</p>
