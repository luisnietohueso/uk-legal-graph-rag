Before the District Judge, Mr Kalandyk had resisted extradition on grounds relating to his absence from criminal proceedings in Poland, and to the impact of extradition on his private and family life.  The District Judge considered and rejected his objections. Her decision and reasons are recorded in a written judgment dated 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2023.  </p>

In order to deal comprehensively with ground 1, it is necessary to adduce this evidence.  I agree with the appellant that the assessment of this evidence by reference to the criminal standard requires a hearing.  It is in any event desirable that the High Court should hear full argument on the implications of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">LU and PH</span> as regards an individual not present at certain criminal legal proceedings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This appeal is accordingly founded on section 20 of the Extradition Act 2003 (&#8216;the Act&#8217;).  Section 20 provides that, in relation to a conviction warrant, if a judge finds that a requested person was not &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">convicted in his presence</span>&#8217;, the judge must go on to decide whether the person &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">deliberately absented himself from his trial</span>&#8217;.  Unless the judge can be satisfied of that, a bar to the extradition may be raised (subject to potential issues about possible retrial which do not arise in the present case).</p>

As Sir Peter Lane noted, the matters on which this appeal is agreed to turn were not fully ventilated before the District Judge, and subsequent evidence has been admitted into the proceedings.  So I am not engaged on the more usual appellate exercise of considering the District Judge&#8217;s decision on its own terms, strictly acting as a court of review.</p>

Art.6 sounds in UK law in a number of ways.  It binds the courts through the Human Rights Act 1998.  By the same route, the UK courts may have regard to the caselaw decisions of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).  Art.6 also sounds in EU law through its Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Since Brexit, decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) no longer bind UK courts, but the courts may still have regard to CJEU caselaw if considered of assistance (see section 6(2) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018).</p>

That is a proposition which may at first sight feel counterintuitive in the England &amp; Wales criminal law context.  We are used to the idea that the judicial fact-finding and exercises of discretion which may be engaged in suspended sentence activation hearings themselves import rights to attend, give evidence and make representations as to the exercise of discretion.  But what this strand of CJEU caselaw affirms is that these kinds of safeguards do not fall to be imported into extradition proceedings.</p>

Plainly, an issue of fairness or indeed lawfulness could arise in a situation where sentence activation is based on a conviction which is itself procedurally unfair.  That is, however, only one example of a number of circumstances in which sentence activation could be tainted by procedural unfairness or indeed illegality.  It could have been based on findings of fact, about, say, breach of suspension conditions, which are wrong, or at any rate properly contestable.  It could be based on no good reason at all.  But where all of that leads to is where both <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ardic</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">LU &amp; PH</span> itself says extradition law does not go &#8211; investigating the basis of activation, and inevitably the activation process itself.</p>

It may be served wholly in the community or it may not.  Extradition warrants are however based on the sentence itself: if that has been properly passed then the individual is subject to a custodial sentence and may be extradited as such.  The individual&#8217;s susceptibility to loss of liberty is inherent in the sentence all along.  </p>

Its analysis remains, however, problematic both in principle and in practice.  It says on the one hand that the discretion of an activating court &#8211; including necessarily its discretion to revoke suspension and order immediate loss of liberty &#8211; is not legally significant, and does not found trial rights for an individual, in an extradition context.  But it says on the other hand that the violation of an individual&#8217;s trial rights in a subsequent conviction on which an activating court relies may, or perhaps must, vitiate that activation for extradition purposes.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Where that leaves an extradition court facing a challenge on this ground is far from clear.  It appears that it would have to investigate the Art.6 compatibility of the activating conviction, but that it need not, or perhaps must not, investigate how the activating court itself dealt with it.  But the extradition court would have to be satisfied that the activating conviction <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> in fact the basis, or perhaps the sole basis, for the activation in the first place.  That inevitably involves some kind of assessment of the activating court&#8217;s decision-making, including perhaps its entitlement to activate on alternative grounds.  And that is hard to reconcile with <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">LU &amp; PH</span>&#8217;s own position, following <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ardic</span>, that that decision-making is not the concern of an extradition court.

It professes adherence to the former model, but, notwithstanding the limits of its terms (considered more fully below) yields to the magnetic pull of the latter in ways which both strain its own internal logic and raise unanswered, and possibly substantial, questions about its operability in practice.

The German convictions were for more serious offending and no complaint is made about the trial procedure leading to them &#8211; Mr Kalandyk was present throughout.  The failure to pay compensation was a breach of conditions which provided an independent basis for activation not reliant on trial procedure of any sort outside the activation hearing itself.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whether Mr Kalandyk <span style="font-style:italic">had</span> failed to make the compensation payment was a disputed matter of fact before me.  But there is no basis in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">LU &amp; PH</span> or anywhere else for an extradition court to expect to investigate <span style="font-style:italic">that </span>matter &#8211; ie a finding of breach of conditions &#8211; as a potential breach of Art.6.  It was a matter purely for the activating court.  (Although if I <span style="font-style:italic">had</span> been required to make a finding of fact about it, I would have been satisfied so that I was sure that the compensation had not been paid.  That is confirmed in the further information provided by the Polish authorities as being the state of the court records.  That is confirmed by the expert witness who also examined the files.  I found Mr Kalandyk&#8217;s assertions to the contrary in his proof of evidence dated 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2023 and in his oral evidence to me entirely unconvincing.  He said in his proof that he had paid the compensation in two instalments but &#8216;given the passage of time I had lost the payment receipts&#8217;.  He told me he lost the receipts when decorating his home.  I found Mr Kalandyk generally to be an unreliable witness of objective fact, his oral account under cross-examination not supporting his written evidence with clarity and consistency.  I note that the District Judge found his accounts, particularly where they relied on forgetfulness, to be self-serving and not genuine.  That was my own assessment also.)</p>

Moreover, in the present case, on such evidence as I have, I might have been able to reach a view that the Polish conviction <span style="font-style:italic">in absentia </span>was not even a materially operative &#8216;cause&#8217; of the warrant &#8211; the suspended sentence could or would have been activated in any event.  I make no such finding because I do not need to, and it is to a degree a speculative or at best inferential exercise.  But in another case in which a disputed conviction <span style="font-style:italic">in absentia</span> played a more dominant role in, even if not standing as the sole reason for, activation, I can see that difficult issues might arise.</p>

The District Judge found as a fact that Mr Kalandyk was present for two days of the hearing of that trial, but absent on the third day, which was when the sentence was pronounced.  She made two important findings of fact, to the criminal standard of proof, about that.  The first was that Mr Kalandyk was aware of that final hearing date and deliberately absented himself from it.  The second was that he was aware that the suspended sentence had been passed, and aware that further offending may lead to the sentence being activated.</p>

He was brought before a court two days afterwards on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016 and formally charged.  He admitted the offence.  And he was told that if he changed his address he was obliged to tell the authorities.  In fact he left for Germany shortly afterwards, without telling the authorities, where, within a matter of days, he was arrested for the German offences.  Mr Kalandyk told me he had intended at the time to spend settled time working in Germany.  That is what he did, briefly, on release from prison and before travelling to the UK.  He also told me he had intended all along to return to Poland.  Since leaving, however, he has not returned there, nor made any attempt to contact the Polish authorities before being arrested on the extradition warrant in the UK.  </p>

In that case, the Supreme Court tied its analysis of section 20&#8217;s test of deliberate absenting to the jurisprudence of Article 6 ECHR &#8211; the right to a fair trial.  It noted (at [33]) that neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or implicitly, the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial.  But to be effective for those purposes, waiver of the right to take part in the trial must be unequivocal.

Examples given were where the accused states publicly or in writing an intention not to respond to summonses of which he has become aware; or succeeds in evading an attempted arrest; or when materials are brought to the attention of the authorities which unequivocally show that he is aware of the proceedings pending against him and of the charges he faces. This points towards circumstances which demonstrate that when accused persons put themselves beyond the jurisdiction of the prosecuting and judicial authorities in a knowing and intelligent way with the result that for practical purposes a trial with them present would not be possible, they may be taken to appreciate that a trial in absence is the only option. ...</p>

He knew he could &#8211; indeed would &#8211; be treated as on notice of future proceedings if he did not make himself available for service.  The court records indicate that he was served at his last address.  Mr Kalandyk told me no papers were delivered &#8211; he knew that, because his wife was living in the house at the time.  I found that account self-serving and lacking credibility.  But in any event, this is not a case of &#8216;mere&#8217;, ignorant or reckless fugitivity, or simple failure of due diligence in ensuring he received notifications at the address he had provided.
