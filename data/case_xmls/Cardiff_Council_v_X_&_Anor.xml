In paragraphs 48-51 of her Report of 25 July 2024, she explained that that time was made up of 5.5 hours per day, which she considered appropriate and required by X in a mainstream classroom with a class size of 23.  She said that, in her opinion, if X were educated in a smaller secondary school environment with smaller class sizes, she &#8220;anticipated that a reduction in the suggested 27.5 hours [TA] time to 5 hours per week would be possible&#8221; (paragraph 51).

It would no doubt have been better if Ms Kershaw had given oral evidence and had been open to cross-examination, but the weight given to evidence is quintessentially a matter for the Panel who no doubt took into account the fact that they only had Ms Kershaw&#8217;s written evidence.  Although I understand the Council does not agree with it, the weight the Panel gave to Ms Kershaw&#8217;s evidence and te specialist teacher&#8217;s evidence respectively was not arguably wrong in law.  The reasons given by the Panel were unarguably adequate: they preferred the evidence of Ms Kershaw (to which they referred) to the evidence (including that of the specialist teacher) which suggested a lower figure for TA support was required.  Nothing further, in terms of reasons, was needed.  The reference to X being out of school in September 2024 was true, albeit it had been, by that stage, only short in duration.</span></p>

In order to have regard to parental preference, the Council (and, on appeal, the ETW) must determine whether either of the exceptions to the general principle under section 9 applies before turning to the exercise of its powers under section 48.</span></p>

Because there is no express duty on a local authority to consider parental preference elsewhere, unless section 9 is considered first, parents have no opportunity to put forward their preference of school for the authority to consider.  In other words, contrary to the statutory requirements, parental choice is excluded from the section 48 analysis.</span></p>

It must be construed so as to be consistent with those obligations on the state, i.e. in a way respecting parental choice of school.  The only way of doing that is to consider section 9 first, and then to perform the analysis required by section 48, through the prism of section 9, as the ETW Panel did.</span></p>

I shall remit the matter to the ETW for reconsideration and redetermination of the issue of whether Section 2D of X&#8217;s IDP should name a maintained school for the purpose of securing X&#8217;s admission to that school because the conditions set out in section 48 have been met.  </span></p>
