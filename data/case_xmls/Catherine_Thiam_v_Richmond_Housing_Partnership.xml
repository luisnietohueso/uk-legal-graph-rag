	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The premises were occupied by Catherine Thiam pursuant to a tenancy agreement dated 26 March 2009. The tenancy was an assured tenancy subject to the provisions of the Housing Act 1988, such that an order for possession could only be made if one or more of the grounds set out in Schedule 2 to the 1988 Act were met.  Richmond Housing Partnership is a social landlord.  It is a subsidiary of a charitable benefits society registered under the Co-Operative and Community Benefits Societies Act 2014.  Community benefit societies are described in the 2014 Act as those whose business is conducted for the benefit of the community. In this judgment I shall refer to Richmond Housing Partnership as &#8220;RHP&#8221; and to Ms Thiam as &#8220;the tenant&#8221;. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application for possession was made by RHP on 21 October 2020.  The application was heard by Judge Luba on various dates between December 2023 and 19 March 2024. The Judge set out the reasons for his decision in an admirably concise and focussed judgment, delivered <span style="font-style:italic">ex tempore</span>.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application for possession was made on a number of grounds.  The first was that rent that was due had not been paid.  That part of the application for possession rested on Ground 8 of the permitted grounds specified in Schedule 2 to the 1988 Act.  The Judge concluded that some &#163;18,000 was overdue and that this part of the application was made out.  Possession was also sought relying on Ground 14 of the Schedule 2 permitted grounds.  This relied on anti-social behaviour on the part of the tenant&#8217;s son who lived at the property.  The Judge referred to the evidence and stated that on the evidence before him he was &#8220;quite satisfied&#8221; that this part of the application was made out.  Thirdly, possession was sought in reliance on Ground 12 of Schedule 2, that an obligation under the tenancy agreement other than the obligation to pay rent had not been performed. The Judge concluded that the tenant had repeatedly, in breach of the tenancy agreement, failed to provide access to the premises to RHP and those who were to undertake maintenance work on RHP&#8217;s behalf.  That part of the application was therefore also made out.  Lastly, possession was sought relying on Ground 13 of the Schedule 2 permitted grounds, that the condition of the premises had deteriorate by acts of waste, neglect and default.  On this matter the Judge&#8217;s reasons were as follows.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Ground 13 of the statutory grounds in Schedule 2 is concerned with the condition of the property. The tenant is responsible for maintaining the property to the extent that it is not in a deleterious condition by dint of their own act or neglect.  This is a case in which Ground 13 is manifestly satisfied.  It was not necessary to conduct a site visit of the property or to turn to the detail of any inspection report.  One can readily see from the photographs and videos made available to the court that the property is in appalling condition, both internally and externally.  The front and rear gardens are full of not only overgrown and unkempt vegetation but also massive number of black bags and other discarded household items.</p>

Whatever the nature of the delusion, the simple fact of the matter is that the premises are grossly unsightly. They are, in the relevant weather conditions, smelly. They provide harbourage for vermin and they are grossly unsightly. One can hardly do better in terms of describing the way in which the premises are not managed by the tenant, both internally and externally, than by taking the words of the tenant&#8217;s son David.  A council homelessness officer sent an email to the claimant which reads as follows:</p>

David states his mum is a hoarder and the property is so overpacked with things that you can&#8217;t move in the property.  David states his mum does car boot sales but does not get rid of anything.  He states the hallway and rooms downstairs are full of stuff. The property is a four-bedroomed and one bedroom you cannot get in because of her belongs. He states the other bedrooms are where he himself, his mum and his sisters sleep but, again, the rooms are crammed with junk.  He also said mum has 50 guinea pigs in the garden and the garden cannot be accessed because of the stuff outside. David also stated the family have a social worker who, in his opinion, is not helping the family.  Please let me know if this family are known to you as hoarders. If not, I will do a safeguarding referral to Social Services given the concerns around safety, possible neglect, and fire risk&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">That was very apt description by David of the state of the premises. Of course, the state of the premises has fluctuated from time to time as, no doubt, the severity of the defendant&#8217;s condition has fluctuated from time to time but the up to date position is shown in two videos taken on recent visits by the newly assigned adult social worker.  This continues to show the property in an extremely poor condition externally. Black rubbish bags full of material is seen discarded all over and into the front garden and all along the side passageways.  Indeed, the bags, together with other obstructions in the side passageway, have made it entirely impossible for any visitor to the property to pass, as they should be able to, down the side passageway of the house from the front to the rear garden.  On that material taken as a whole, I have not the slightest hesitation in finding Ground 13 satisfied.</p>

I do not need to deal with the matter in greater particularity because, on behalf of the Official Solicitor, Mr Gr&#252;tters has taken the sensible position of simply putting [RHP] to proof and such proof has been amply forthcoming. So, the grounds are proven.&#8221;</p>

In reliance on an expert report prepared by Dr Sajid Suleman dated 15 November 2022, the Judge accepted that the tenant was disabled within the definition at section 6 of and Schedule 1 to the Equality Act 2010 (&#8220;the 2010 Act&#8221;).  The Judge accepted the position as pleaded on behalf of the tenant at paragraph 34.2 of the Defence and Counterclaim. </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.03in">The [tenant] is disabled within the meaning of s.6 of the Equality Act 2010.  She meets the diagnostic criteria for simple schizophrenia and housing disorder.  Her symptoms have persisted for over twelve months and are long-standing.  She was diagnosed with delusional disorder in or around 2008 and has a history of systematised, persecutory, and grandiose delusions.  She minimises the extent of hoarding in her home, is unable to recognise the extent of it, or have insight into it.  She has aimlessness, is socially withdrawn, lacks initiative and motivation, and has delusional beliefs. The quality of her life declines without her understanding of it. Due to her lack of insight, she refuses help. She has a mental impairment. Her symptoms have a substantial effect on her ability to carry out normal day-to-day duties.&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">She suffers from a wider range of delusional disorders associated with her schizophrenia and these explain other facets of the conduct which has led to her landlord&#8217;s claim for possession. For example, in relation to rent arrears, she believes, as one sees from the way in which her defence and counterclaim is pleaded, that she is, in some sense, a self-employed businesswoman engaged in transactions for the sale and resale of clothing and other items.  That is a complete delusion.  Anyone can see at a moment&#8217;s glance that she is hoarding junk and as her son graphically puts it, cannot even sell this junk at car boot fairs.  She has no insight.  Exactly the same can be said of the importance of the conduct of her son in behaving himself at the property and in relation to compliance with her obligations under the conditions of her tenancy. With the benefit of the advice of the assessor, having regard to the disabling conditions in this case, I have not the least hesitation in finding that there is the necessary causal link particularly for the purpose of s.15 of the Act.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One further point to be made in this regard is that, notwithstanding the evidence I have referred to, prior to Dr Suleman&#8217;s report the tenant had nothing that could be considered to be any form of formal diagnosis that she suffered from any mental disorder.  The opinion formed in 2008 in respect of delusional disorder was an opinion formed by the local authority mental health team. That opinion is described as a &#8220;differential diagnosis&#8221;, that is to say an opinion arising from observation of the subject when what is observed suggests that the subject displays conditions or behaviours that could support a formal diagnosis.  Dr Suleman&#8217;s conclusion, having had the opportunity to meet the tenant, was that it was &#8220;likely&#8221; that she suffered from simple schizophrenia (a form of schizophrenia where delusions and hallucinations are poorly formed and not prominent), and that in consequence of the simple schizophrenia the tenant suffered from hoarding disorder. However, it remains the fact that the tenant&#8217;s schizophrenia has never been treated.  She has failed to engage with doctors or other professionals to permit her condition to be addressed by medication.</p>

At the time of that hearing (as at the hearing of this appeal) the tenant was represented by Mr Gr&#252;tters of counsel, instructed by the Official Solicitor who acted as the tenant&#8217;s litigation friend by Order of the court made on 24 January 2023. At the hearing before the Judge, Mr Gr&#252;tters did not substantively challenge the evidence that RHP relied on in support of its application for possession but, entirely appropriately, did put RHP to proof on all matters.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The point taken for the tenant before the Judge was by way of counterclaim and/or by way of engaging the court&#8217;s power under section 7(4) of the 1988 Act. It was contended that the decision to seek possession amounted to unlawful discrimination on the grounds of disability and that for that reason either the application for possession should be refused or, as a matter of discretion under section 7(4) of the 1988 Act, possession should not be granted. The discrimination case was that the decision to seek possession on Ground 13 of the Schedule 2 grounds (the ground concerning the condition of the premises) was, for the purposes of section 15 of the 2010 Act, unfavourable treatment because it comprised an act in consequence of the tenant&#8217;s disability that was not justified in the sense explained in section 15(1)(b) of the 2010 Act.

The outcome of the application for possession therefore turned on the issue of justification. By section 15(1)(b) of the 2010 Act unfavourable treatment occurring because of something arising in consequence of a disability is justified if the defendant to the discrimination claim can show the unfavourable treatment, in this instance, the decision to seek possession of the premises at 5 Chaucer Avenue, was &#8220;a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim&#8221;.

This is apparent it is said from a document dated 13 October 2020 headed &#8220;Justification Exercise&#8221;, which was prepared by Samantha Driver one of the housing advisers employed by RHP, to evidence the reasons for the decision to pursue the possession proceedings.  The submission made for the tenant is that it followed that the decision to commence possession proceedings was not proportionate and that this matter was not addressed by the Judge.</p>

Mr Gr&#252;tters referred to an organisation called Clouds End.  It appears that that organisation is based in the West Midlands, but that is not to the point.  Such expertise would be available in west London and RHP, it is submitted, ought to have had resort to such expertise before deciding to start possession proceedings.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question of proportionality under section 15(1)(b) of the 2010 Act is a question to be determined by the court, objectively.  To this extent the exercise is akin to the one undertaken by the court when it considers proportionality in the context of claims alleging breach of qualified Convention rights. The notion of whether unfavourable action can be &#8220;proportionate&#8221; is not the same as simply asking whether there was something more that the person concerned, in this case, RHP, could have done.  In every case it will often if not always be possible to say that one or more further steps could have been taken by the person who afforded the unfavourable treatment. The decision on proportionality requires a court to consider in the round, the nature of the unfavourable treatment, the nature of the claimant&#8217;s disability, and any acts or admissions of the alleged discriminator in the context of the circumstances that prevailed. Section 15(1)(b) of the 2010 Act concerns whether what the defendant did (the unfavourable treatment) was a proportionate response in the circumstances that prevailed, when account is taken of the claimant&#8217;s disability including, in the circumstances of this case, the contribution that disability made to the state of affairs that RHP sought to address. The proportionality inquiry that section 15(1)(b) requires must also take account of context.  In this instance some relevant context is provided by the contractual relationship between RHP and the tenant, framed by the terms of the tenancy agreement.  RHP has no relevant authority beyond this. It is not a local authority or a social services authority exercising statutory powers and having obligations to consider and promote the well-being of persons subject to illness or disability. </p>

The history speaks to an inadequate response from mental health services, from multi-agency task force and its meetings, from Children&#8217;s Services and from Adult Social Services.  All of them have failed because the defendant herself has failed to engage with them.  It is no surprise that the greatest engagement has come when faced with the prospect, perhaps, of the loss of the ability to live with her own youngest child.</p>

First, the task of obtaining the relevant report and putting it into the hands of the statutory agencies was delegated by a multi-agency working group to a particular social worker, the children&#8217;s social worker.  She candidly told me that although that was an action point for her, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">she</span> had never undertaken the action point. Secondly, the relevant documentation has been in the hands of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s solicitor since, at the latest, late 2022 or early 2023.  It appears, however, that the only interaction with statutory services, in the form of Children&#8217;s Services certainly, has come in the last week or two between that solicitor and that organisation. If the person who had commissioned and held the report, the Official Solicitor, did not think it right to share it directly with the statutory agencies, it is unsurprising that an agency which was simply the landlord of the defendant did not feel itself earlier able to share the terms of that particular document.</p>

First, to seek to maximise, in every possible way, opportunities to support the tenant in her engagement with the statutory services and to secure the operation of the statutory services delivering assistance to her.  I am quite satisfied that this landlord has behaved responsibly and reasonably in doing all it could in that respect.  No doubt there are shades of suggestions of things that it could have done earlier, or could have been done more effectively.  The general picture portrayed and certainly the picture portrayed in the course of these possession proceedings, has been that no stone has been left unturned.</p>

For so long as she holds to that view, however much encouragement and engagement is offered by the landlord and by the statutory services, nothing substantive is likely to change.  Had she given evidence herself, I am quite satisfied that she would have told me that there is nothing in relation to the condition of the property or the behaviour of her son to worry about, and that there was no need to do anything about the rent arears because she was well able to manage her own finances.</p>

However, this claimant landlord does not have the skills or resources to produce such an assessment and make such an application. The statutory agencies do and the statutory agencies are now, at last and encouraged by the witness summons process which has brought them to this court, at least contemplating the possibility of such an application if a process of final attempts at engagement fail.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first ground of appeal fails because whether or not RHP considered the tenant to be disabled (within the definition of the 2010 Act) and whether or not RHP formed a view that there was or might be any connection between that disability and the conduct that caused RHP to decide to seek possession is not central to and cannot be determinative of the section 15(1)(b) proportionality issue. The proportionality issue is objective and in circumstances such as those in the present case must approached on the assumption that there was a connection between the claimant&#8217;s disability and the state of affairs the alleged discriminator is seeking to address. The steps taken (or not taken) by the alleged discriminator are to be assessed on their own terms. Whether at the time he acted (or failed to act) the alleged discriminator accepted the connection existed will not affect the assessment of what he did or what he failed to do since that is essentially a matter of process not substance and proportionality is concerned with substance. An alleged discriminator who recognised the connection ought not (for the purposes of the application of section 15(1)(b) of the 2010 Act) be better-placed than one who did not. To use the shorthand used in the section 15 itself, where the unfavourable treatment afforded by A to B is in response to things that B has done, A&#8217;s unfavourable treatment of B is capable of being a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim even if A does not consider that B&#8217;s actions were in consequence of a disability. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the present case, the proper approach to the application of section 15(1)(b) of the 2010 Act is to consider all circumstances. RHP&#8217;s state of mind as to whether the hoarding was a consequence of the tenant&#8217;s disability was not a point to which any real weight attached. It could not have been determinative.  When applying section 15(1)(b) of the 2010 Act to the facts of this case, it is more important to consider what RHP did and what RHP might have done further before deciding to seek possession. This was the approach taken by the Judge and I can see no error in that approach or in the conclusion that approach caused him to reach. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This evidence, which was tested before the Judge but not undermined, shows the lengths that RHP went to when seeking to address the hoarding problem.  In the abstract, it will always be possible to say that something more could have been tried, but the section 15(1)(b) proportionality test must be applied in context.  The context here was that RHP was a landlord.  The extent of its powers of control over the tenant were set by the terms of the tenancy agreement. RHP could seek to persuade the tenant to address the problem.  I am satisfied that it did attempt to persuade the tenant. RHP could seek to involve others such as the local authority social services department who had wider powers to assist the tenant. RHP did that too. I do not consider that the obligation to act proportionally imposed by section 15(1)(b) of the 2010 Act required RHP itself to engage specialist help for the tenant.  Taking such a step would go well beyond anything ordinarily or, in the circumstances of this case, reasonably within the ambit of a landlord and tenant relationship.  It was entirely consistent with the section 15(1)(b) obligation for RHP to submit that interventions of that sort should be the responsibility of the social services department rather than the landlord.  Mr Strelitz, counsel for RHP, also pointed to the likely cost of such specialist services and the finite resources of a social landlord such as RHP.  That too is a material point.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Lastly in respect of this ground of appeal, the proportionality obligation did not require RHP to retain its specialist assistance because in all possibility that would have been futile. Such information as is available about the specialist services relied on for the purposes of this ground of appeal is to the effect that those who offer these services work with and require the consent of the person concerned.  Without that consent little or no progress can be made.  Dr Suleman&#8217;s evidence was that the hoarding was caused by the delusional disorder that was a consequence of the simple schizophrenia that afflicts the tenant.  That condition was untreated as the tenant did not wish to receive medical help.  Thus, there was a vicious circle.  For so long as the tenant declined to be treated for the disorder that affected her, she would suffer from the delusion that she was a businesswoman conducting a business; she was not hoarding, she was merely maintaining her stock.  Until such time as the tenant agreed to treatment, the conditions necessary for the specialist to have any hope of making progress could not exist.   For all the reasons the second ground of appeal fails.  </p>

It was that when faced with a person in these circumstances, what was really needed was an assessment of more general incapacity and then an application to the Court of Protection.  However, this claimant landlord does not have the skills or resources to produce such an assessment and make such an application.  The statutory agencies do and the statutory agencies are now, at last and encouraged by the witness summons process which has brought them to this court, at least contemplating the possibility of such an application if a process of final attempts at engagement fail.&#8221;</p>

Any chance of success before the Court of Protective would be contingent on a conclusion that the tenant lacked capacity in a relevant respect. Such a conclusion would not have been close to a foregone conclusion.  Although in these proceedings the tenant has come (since January 2023) to be represented by the Official Solicitor, there were Family Court proceedings that took place in 2021 and in those proceedings there was no question that the tenant lacked capacity.  Even if the issue of capacity were overcome it is unclear what order might have been sought on an application to the Court of Protection made by RHP.   Mr Gr&#252;tters relied on the situation considered by the Court of Protection in<span style="font-style:italic"> A Local Authority v X</span> [2023] EWCOP 64 as a parallel, suggesting that RHP could do the same as the local authority did in that case.  I am not convinced that a parallel exists.  The situation before the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">X </span>can be seen in paragraph 79 of the judgment of Theis J.</p>

The evidence, he submits, demonstrates that this can only be done with X living elsewhere and not being able to return to the flat whilst that is done. The local authority seeks orders that X is taken to an appropriate supported living placement and for an order to be made depriving her of her liberty there to prevent her returning to her flat until the necessary work has been done. The local authority recognises that the order it seeks interferes with X&#8217;s Article 8 rights to respect for her private life and home but submit such orders are justified and proportionate bearing in mind the risks to X, such orders being necessary for the protection of her health and only for a temporary period.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There, the court was asked to make a choice on X&#8217;s behalf as to where she should live, albeit temporarily. In that case where X<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>should live was a means to an end:  if she lived in the supported living placement that would be in order to allow the local authority to remove her possessions from the premises X rented from the local authority.  However, that does not seem to me to show that RHP&#8217;s decision to start possession proceedings without first making an application to the Court of Protection was dis-proportionate. In the present case RHP&#8217;s notional application would not be premised on any choice between which of 2 places the tenant should live.  Rather it would be an application by a landlord for permission to enter premises and remove the tenant&#8217;s possessions.</p>

The course now suggested as one required by section 15(1)(b) to the 2010 Act would have required RHP to incur significant expenditure on litigation (legal costs and no doubt also the costs of expert evidence) in pursuit of an exercise that was speculative. These were the matters averted to by the Judge at paragraph 67 of his judgment. That would go well beyond any step that could legitimately be expected of a landlord and well beyond anything that could reasonably be considered as a requirement of a proportionate approach on the facts of this case.  The third ground of appeal also fails.</p>
