By s.101, New York Convention awards may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment or order of the court to the same effect. However, such an order can be challenged by the defendant. On 5 May 2022, India applied to set aside the enforcement order on the basis that it is immune from the jurisdiction of the English Courts under s.1 SIA, and that s.9 SIA does not apply because India did not agree to submit the relevant disputes to arbitration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are a considerable number of complexities which arise in this litigation partly because of concurrent litigation in the Netherlands.  The matter came on for a directions hearing before Sir Nigel Teare sitting as a Judge of the High Court. I pay respectful tribute to his judgment. The question (the &#8220;s.2 question&#8221;) was identified for preliminary resolution.  The s.2 question is set out in an order he made on 23 October 2024 as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is necessary to say a little more by way of explanation of the s.2 question.  It is referred to by the Claimants in their skeleton argument as being &#8220;whether India, by consenting under Article III of &#8230; the NYC to the Courts of the UK recognising and enforcing the Awards has thereby, by prior written agreement, submitted to the adjudicative jurisdiction of the English Courts for the purposes of s. 2(2) of the SIA&#8221;.  It is referred to by India as in its skeleton argument as being &#8220;whether India&#8217;s ratification of the &#8230; NYC is, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">on its own</span> and regardless of whether India agreed to arbitration, a submission by &#8220;prior written agreement&#8221; under s.2(2) SIA&#8221; (underlining in the original).  It is not suggested by either party that there is any substantive difference in their formulations. What is contemplated is ratification of the NYC, on its own, and regardless of whether India agreed to arbitration. It has been described to me as a pure point of law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should make clear the practical limits of this question.  Normally, such a question does not arise in English law, because by s. 9 SIA, where a State has agreed in writing to submit a dispute to arbitration, the State is not immune as respects proceedings in the courts of the United Kingdom which relate to the arbitration.  There is no need to rely on a freestanding submission in Article III by reason of the state&#8217;s ratification of the NYC.  However, as is not unusual in these cases, India disputes the agreement to arbitrate. At my request, the parties agreed a statement as to their respective positions as regards s. 9:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure">
              <embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;In addition to their case under s. 2, the Claimants also rely upon the exception to state immunity in s.9 of the SIA based on an alleged arbitration agreement said to be contained in the BIT.  India disputes the Claimants&#8217; reliance upon s.9 of the SIA, and contends that it did not agree to arbitrate the disputes. In this regard, India relies on various grounds, including the contention (that is opposed by the Claimants) that the legality requirements of the BIT were not met. In addition, in the context of the s.9 question, India has made an application for a stay of the proceedings based on the Court&#8217;s general case management powers, so far as applicable when resolving a question of state immunity, by reference to certain proceedings before the Dutch Courts, the courts of the seat. The Claimants oppose the stay application. &#8230; Sir Nigel Teare gave directions for the progression of Dutch and Indian law evidence, for the purposes of the s.9 question, including the stay application.  Those procedural steps remain in progress.  Accordingly, the s.9 question and India&#8217;s application for a case management stay remain outstanding and have not yet been determined. Neither the s.9 question, nor the stay application are for determination in this judgment.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In essence, the Claimants are pursuing the s. 2 question so as to bypass any further consideration of sovereign immunity, and so as to be able to proceed immediately to deal with India&#8217;s objections (which they contend have no merit and will be summarily dismissed) under the NYC.  This will save considerable time, and they have described in some detail the extraordinary delays in enforcement that have occurred elsewhere in the world, and will occur in England if issues related to state immunity require to be determined.</p>

The s. 2 question concerns submission to the court&#8217;s adjudicative jurisdiction, that is, its submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom.  Submission as regards enforcement of arbitration awards against States is dealt with separately in s.13 of the SIA scheme, and raises different and discrete issues. By s. 13(2)(b), the property of a State is not subject to any process for the enforcement of an arbitration award, with an exception in respect of property which is used for commercial purposes (s. 13(4)).  Similarly to s. 2(2) in respect of jurisdiction, s. 13(3) lifts immunity with the written consent of the State concerned.  However, and importantly, it goes on to provide that &#8220;a provision merely submitting to the jurisdiction of the courts is not to be regarded as a consent &#8230;&#8221;. The enforcement issues have not been argued before me, and it is the position of both parties that submission to the court&#8217;s enforcement jurisdiction is also not a question arising for decision at this hearing. However, in their submissions, the Claimants assert that the use of the word &#8220;enforce&#8221; in Article III may well go beyond adjudicative jurisdiction, and constitute consent to enforcement under s.13(3).  This arose in the hearing as an issue, which I address further below.</p>

The &#8220;S-Band&#8221; is a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be used to send and receive signals using small units, such as mobile phones and laptops, without requiring their antennas to be pointed directly at the satellite.  The Devas Contract contained an arbitration clause providing for arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the ICC or UNCITRAL with a seat in New Delhi. There is no waiver of state immunity in the contract and presumably no need, since this was in substance a commercial contract between two Indian companies, albeit one is state owned.</p>

This was publicly announced at the time. The annulment decision was taken by the Indian Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS).  This comprised of the Prime Minister, Minister of Home Affairs, Minister of External Affairs, Minister of Finance and the Minister of Defence; the Indian Space Commission; the Department of Space; the Indian Space Research Organisation; Antrix; and the Additional Solicitor-General, one of the law officers of India (<span style="font-style:italic">CCDM Holdings, LLC v Republic of India (No 3)</span> [2023] FCA 1266 at [11]).

This resulted in an award against Antrix dated 14 September 2015 (the &#8220;ICC Award&#8221;) in the sum of USD 562.5m on grounds of wrongful repudiation of the contract by Antrix. This case is not directly concerned with that award, though it does feature quite extensively in the Claimants&#8217; account of events.  As a matter of history, it was subsequently set aside in the Delhi High Court, reliance being placed on an earlier decision of the Supreme Court of India in proceedings for the liquidation of Devas.  It was recognised and enforced, however, by a decision of the Hague Court of Appeal on 17 December 2024, on grounds of absence of due process in the Indian proceedings.  </p>

India&#8217;s case is that the &#8220;investment&#8221; under the BIT did not meet the legality requirements, so that India&#8217;s offer to arbitrate in Article 8 of the BIT did not apply and the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to arbitrate the Claimants&#8217; claims. In the English proceedings, India&#8217;s state immunity challenge also pursues the argument that there was no qualifying &#8220;investment&#8221;.  However, the Claimants emphasise in argument that the Illegality Allegations were only raised after the awards.  They consist of allegations as to misrepresentations made as to Devas&#8217;s intention to use relevant technology, as to Devas&#8217;s ownership of intellectual property, as to an alleged fraudulent diversion of investment to the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> to 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Claimants, and as to misrepresentations made to the Indian regulatory authority that the technology would be developed indigenously.

That case concerned awards made under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, 1965 (the ICSID Convention). As the Court explains, the ICSID Convention does not itself constitute an agreement to arbitrate but provides a framework for the resolution of disputes submitted to ICSID. A separate agreement to arbitrate is therefore required, as in a BIT between two states, together with the arbitral claimant&#8217;s acceptance of the offer to arbitrate which is deemed to be contained in the relevant treaty.</p>

So far as I am aware, it has not hitherto been argued that a state is precluded from claiming sovereign immunity in relation to the recognition and enforcement of an award under the New York Convention. Yet if the claimants are right that state immunity is lost by virtue of the obligation in article 54 to recognise an ICSID award as binding and enforce it as if it were a final judgment of a national court, the same consequence must logically flow from the materially identical obligation in article III of the New York Convention to recognise an award as binding and enforce it in accordance with the rules of procedure of the relevant country. Indeed, this is precisely the consequence which has been held to follow in two recent decisions in Australia and the USA respectively.</p>

On the contrary, the blanket immunity provided for in section 1 of the State Immunity Act confirms that state immunity is very much more than a matter of mere procedure, being a substantive bar to proceedings where it applies. It is procedural only in the sense that the court must dismiss a claim in respect of which a state can claim immunity without adjudicating on the merits: see <span style="font-style:italic">Benkharbouche v Embassy of the Republic of Sudan</span> [2019] AC 777, para 18. I cannot therefore accept that the mere reference to procedural laws has the effect of preserving state immunity for the purposes of the New York Convention when it would otherwise have been lost. Nor can I accept that it makes any difference that the New York Convention permits wider grounds of challenge to an award than the ICSID Convention. The extent to which an award can be reviewed, if at all, has nothing whatsoever to do with state immunity.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In this sense, the insistence by international authority that a waiver of immunity in an international agreement must be "express" is an insistence that any inference of a waiver of immunity must be drawn with great care when interpreting the express words of that agreement in context. It does not deny that implications are almost invariably contained in any (expressed) words of a treaty. As senior counsel for Spain rightly put the point in oral submissions: "[T]here must be implications that surround every textual passage. The question is: what are those implications, and what level of clarity about the implication<br/>is required?" Accordingly, if an international agreement does not<br/>expressly use the word "waiver", the inference that an express term involves a waiver of immunity will only be drawn if the implication is clear from the words used and the context. In words quoted by Lord Goff in <span style="font-style:italic">Pinochet [No 3] </span>from the International Law Commission's commentary upon (what were then) the draft articles on jurisdictional immunities of States and their property, there is "no room" to recognise an implication of "consent of an unwilling state which has not expressed its consent in a clear and recognisable manner.&#8221;</p>

Viewed in this way, the court treats the concept of implication in the context of a linguistic understanding of the meaning of the words of the treaty in question without diminishing the undoubted requirement in English law that a &#8220;prior written agreement&#8221; under s. 2(2) SIA must be express &#8211; as indeed is required under international law &#8211; see <span style="font-style:italic">Pinochet</span> at pp. 215 to 217.

The process of implication does not arise in a discrete sense, as it does in the case of implied contractual terms, since it is a question of construing the words relied on to determine whether the necessary threshold of express agreement is crossed.

Under international law (and under English law), India contends, the rules of state immunity are regarded as &#8220;procedural&#8221;. State immunity is immunity from jurisdiction, not immunity from liability.  India relies on the statement in the <span style="font-style:italic">Infrastructure Services</span> case set out above, that as state immunity is regarded as a procedural bar as a matter of international law, &#8220;it may be that article III preserves state immunity on its own terms&#8221; (at [102(i)]).</p>

This is confined, they contend, to questions as to the form of the request for recognition and enforcement and the competent authority, not conditions of enforcement.  In the UK, the relevant rules of procedure are those specified by CPR Part 62, Part III at [62.17]&#8211;[62.19]. Under Article III, the conditions of enforcement are exclusively those laid down under the NYC in Articles IV&#8211;VI. The NYC is a complete code from which an enforcing State cannot derogate (citing <span style="font-style:italic">IPCO (Nigeria) Ltd v Nigerian National Petroleum Corpn</span> [2017] 1 WLR 970 at [41]-[43]).  There is no scope for relying upon the words &#8220;rules of procedure&#8221; to impose an additional substantive condition on enforcement in the form of state immunity. The Claimants rely on the statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Benkharbouche v Embassy of the Republic of Sudan</span> [2019] AC 777 at [16], Lord Sumption, that the dichotomy between procedural and substantive rules is not always straightforward. The judgment states that state immunity is not procedural in the sense that the organisation and practices of the court are procedural, but in the sense that it requires the court to dismiss the claim without determining the merits, leaving intact the claimant&#8217;s legal rights and any relevant defences.</p>

Both Born, <span style="font-style:italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span>, 3rd Ed.

I agree with the commentary in this respect.  However, the discussion in Born is not specific to state immunity. As regards Van den Berg, in the context of explaining that an arbitration agreement and award to which a state is a party are not excluded from the Convention, he refers at p.280 to immunity from jurisdiction saying that the applicability of the Convention is applicable in this type of case as well.  As India submits, he does not suggest that ratification of Article III amounts on its own to a waiver &#8211; he draws attention, for example, to cases in which an agreement to arbitrate is held to constitute an implicit waiver of immunity.</p>

The particular question the Federal Court was being asked to answer was whether there was &#8220;&#8230; any waiver by States pursuant to Art III of the New York Convention subject to local &#8216;rules of procedure&#8217;, including the forum&#8217;s laws of foreign State immunity?&#8221; (see the heading above [94]). It is not clear whether this is the precise question at issue in the present case. Further, under Australian law, unlike English law, sovereign immunity is regarded as substantive rather than procedural ([94]). In any case, the judge did not find it necessary to refer to the content of the commentary to answer the question as put to him (see [96]), and in the somewhat different legal framework this is not surprising. The contention in the present case is that the reference to &#8220;rules of procedure&#8221; in Article III negates the ratification of the Convention as consent under the UK statute &#8211; the relevance of the commentary is that it shows that the terms of Article III have not been understood internationally as on their own signifying a state&#8217;s consent to the jurisdiction.</p>

That same argument applies, it is submitted, to ss. 100-101 Arbitration Act 1996 which applies the New York Convention.  The Claimants are right to describe this as the seminal English law case on BITs, but the passage cited at [32] posits a valid agreement to arbitrate, which is at issue in this case.  The court points out that the application of the NYC depends on such an agreement, but it does not suggest the ratification of the NYC in itself provides it.</p>

More importantly, as the ICJ in the <span style="font-style:italic">Germany v Italy</span> case at para 57 stated, state immunity is one of the fundamental principles of the international legal order.  An outcome, at least so far as the UK legislation is concerned, by which Article III NYC does not &#8211; on its own &#8211; amount to consent under s.2(2) SIA, does not in any way contradict the narrow reading of the reference to &#8220;rules of procedure&#8221; in Article III which has the support of Born and Van den Berg, both of whom are leading commentators on the NYC.</p>

The Claimants made a formidable case as to the extraordinary delays in enforcement that have occurred elsewhere in the world and will occur in England if issues related to state immunity require to be determined.  The BIT Awards were made by a respected tribunal, who appear to have sought a degree of compromise so as to treat both sides fairly. India&#8217;s efforts to avoid honouring the BIT Awards may perhaps be explained by the fact that it regards the issues as going to its vital national interests, but it is an aspect of the BIT that it entered into that there is no expectation on the part of the parties that a court will go behind the arbitration awards. Nevertheless, India is correct to submit (and the Claimants do not challenge) that the s.2 question raises a point of law the answer to which has to be made on legal principle and cannot depend on the history of these particular proceedings.</p>

This raises some considerable questions, given the clear distinction between adjudication and enforcement, and possible unintended consequences.  I raised with the parties the effect on s. 14(4) SIA 1978 by which the property of a state&#8217;s central bank or other monetary authority is not to be regarded as in use for commercial purposes, and so available for execution. The parties differed in argument as to whether on the Claimants&#8217; case this immunity would in fact be waived.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To put this into a broader commercial context, there are a vast number of commercial and financial transactions involving states and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) where waiver of state immunity is a matter of contract, not treaty.  In the sovereign debt market, for example, lending by institutions such as the IMF and World Bank is not supported by waivers, and not all states are prepared to give waivers &#8211; but most do. The extent of the waivers, whether comprehensive including as to enforcement, or limited in some way, is a matter of negotiation and relative bargaining power. Under English law, contractual waivers are construed in accordance with ordinary principles of contractual interpretation &#8211; a restrictive interpretation is not applied to waiver clauses where one of the parties is a State (<span style="font-style:italic">General Dynamics United Kingdom Limited v The State of Libya</span> [2025] EWCA Civ 134 at [11]).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These principles take effect against a statutory regime which recognises the fact that SOEs and states themselves are heavily involved in commerce, providing (subject to contrary agreement) for the lifting of immunity in commercial transactions (enacted in the UK by s.3 SIA), and the general availability for enforcement of property in use for commercial purposes enacted by s.13(4) SIA. Similar principles are widely accepted in international commerce generally, though in China as recently as 2024. In the arbitration context, by s. 9 SIA, it is specifically provided that where the state has agreed in writing to submit a dispute to arbitration, it is not immune as respects proceedings in the UK courts which relate to the arbitration. Similarly, as noted above, the <span style="font-style:italic">Ecuador v Occidental Exploration </span>case shows that BIT awards fall within the scope of the UK&#8217;s Arbitration Act 1996, the basis of the analysis being the agreement in writing to arbitrate contained in the BIT, which is analysed as a standing offer to potential investors.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Against this supportive legal background, it may be thought that the market is capable of restricting state immunity where it may arise, and it is not clear why the ratification of the NYC alone should be treated as a waiver of adjudicative immunity particularly where there was no intent on the part of the drafters of the NYC to exclude immunity-based arguments in enforcement actions against states.  The balance between investors and states in investment disputes is a delicate and currently controversial one, and nothing seems to impel a conclusion that ratification of the NYC is in and of itself a waiver of immunity, where express waivers are a commercial commonplace. Such an outcome appears to give too little weight to the fact that &#8220;&#8230; state immunity occupies an important place in international law and international relations&#8221; (as per the ICJ&#8217;s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Germany v Italy</span>, quoted in <span style="font-style:italic">Argentum</span>, op. cit. at [15], and never doubted).  This does not in any way contradict the enforcement friendly aspect of the NYC, which is its purpose, and the reason for its success, and which has been consistently upheld in English law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It will be recalled that the parties characterise the question as a &#8220;pure point of law&#8221;.  I would answer the question put as follows.  Section 2(2) of the UK&#8217;s State Immunity Act 1978 (SIA) provides that a state may submit to the jurisdiction of the UK courts by a prior written agreement.  I consider that by reason only of its ratification of the New York Convention 1958 (NYC), the Republic of India has not submitted to the jurisdiction, or to put it another way, ratification of the NYC by India does not in and of itself amount to consent by way of a &#8220;prior written agreement&#8221; by the state waiving its immunity.  This is because (1) there is no indication that it was the intention of the drafters of the NYC to preclude immunity-based arguments in enforcement actions against states, and overall the commentary is to the effect that immunity-based arguments are not precluded, (2) applying the established classification of state immunity in English and international law, the reference to &#8220;rules of procedure&#8221; in Article III NYC preserves state immunity in its own terms, and (3) applying the test for waiver in English law, the ratification of Art III of the NYC is not, on its own, a waiver of state immunity by India.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Among the practical considerations, in the context of arbitration, s.9 of the UK&#8217;s SIA specifically provides that where a state has agreed in writing to submit a dispute to arbitration it is not immune as respects proceedings which relate to the arbitration. In this case, India disputes the arbitration agreement, and there are proceedings in the Netherlands which is the seat of the arbitration. In principle, however, where there is an issue as to the effect or validity of the arbitration agreement, determination of the issue for state immunity purposes should be determinative for NYC purposes as well avoiding duplication. In any event, the conclusion I have reached is not intended to contradict in any way the enforcement friendly aspect of the NYC, which is its purpose, and the reason for its success, and which has been consistently upheld in the English courts. It simply recognises that international jurisprudence which holds that &#8220;&#8230; state immunity occupies an important place in international law and international relations&#8221;, also has to be taken into account in deciding the narrow, but important, issue of whether a state has by treaty given its consent to waive that immunity.</p>

On the proper interpretation of Article I, the term &#8220;person, whether physical or legal&#8221; only applies to states in relation to private law disputes. The text of Article I in relation to states is at least &#8220;ambiguous&#8221; in its application to states, and does not give any direct hint from which it would be possible to infer that states are also capable of being parties to an arbitral agreement and the subject of an arbitration award.  The travaux of the NYC show that the NYC was only intended to apply to states in relation to disputes under private law.  The detail is set out in an annex to India&#8217;s skeleton argument.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.78in;text-indent:0.09in">As to the declaration, India&#8217;s contention is that it ratified the NYC subject to a declaration under Article I(3) stating (after dealing with reciprocity) &#8220;&#8230; the Government of India &#8230; declare that they will apply the Convention only to differences arising out of legal relationships, whether contractual or not, which are considered as commercial under the Laws of India.&#8221; India relies on the appellate decision in Australia in <span style="font-style:italic">India v CCDM Holdings, LLC</span> [2025] FCAFC 2, referred to a number of times in this judgment.  This held that India&#8217;s declaration is a &#8220;reservation&#8221; expressly authorised by Article I NYC the effect of which is to exclude or modify the provisions of the NYC, to the extent of India&#8217;s reservation, in India&#8217;s relations with all other State parties to the NYC, on a reciprocal basis. Accordingly, any submission by India could only have been for the enforcement of awards that &#8220;determine differences arising out of a legal relationship that is considered as commercial under the law of India&#8221;.  It is for the Claimants to establish this, and they have not advanced any case, or evidence as whether the BIT awards arise out of such a legal relationship.  For that reason alone, they have failed to discharge their burden of proving the &#8220;prior written agreement&#8221; under s.2(2) SIA. Alternatively, the Court should proceed on the basis of English law, either based on the &#8220;default rule&#8221;, or based on the &#8220;presumption of similarity&#8221;. On that basis, the Awards do not &#8220;determine differences arising out of a legal relationship that is considered as &#8220;commercial&#8221; because they arise under a BIT governed by international law principles, and the relevant &#8220;differences&#8221; were as to the annulment by the Indian Government, not as to the contract itself.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.78in;text-indent:0.09in">As to the second point, the appellate decision of the Australian court finding in favour of India on this point is misconceived because: (i) The reservation in question is not a reciprocal reservation but a unilateral reservation whereby a Contracting State can reserve the applicability of the NYC to the enforcement of awards that, as a matter of its own national law, it considers to be commercial, but only in its own territory. The UK cannot apply the commercial reservation to the enforcement of awards in the UK, and India has consented to the UK enforcing foreign arbitral awards without a commercial reservation. The VCLT, a later treaty that the UK entered into subsequently (India is not a party to the VCLT, although that treaty simply reflects customary international law), cannot alter the terms of the multilateral NYC treaty to which India and the UK have subscribed. (ii) Article 21(1)(b) of the VCLT, which provides that &#8220;[a] reservation established with regard to another party in accordance with articles 19, 20 and 23 modifies those provisions to the same extent for that other party in its relations with the reserving State&#8221; is incapable of applying to India&#8217;s commercial reservation. India&#8217;s commercial reservation is territorial in nature, applying to the enforcement of awards in India; it is incapable of being applied on a reciprocal basis. (iii) In any event, an English court would treat an investment treaty award of the present kind as falling within India&#8217;s commercial reservation to the NYC, given the purpose of the BIT to promote investment and develop business, and the fact that arbitration may be subject to the UNCITRAL Rules designed for international commercial arbitration. (iv)  Reference is also made to the most favoured nation (MFN) clause at Article 11 of the BIT that permits the investor to take advantage of any international law obligation undertaken by India either at the time of entering into the BIT or subsequently. India has entered into a number of bilateral investment treaties in which it has made clear that a claim by an investor under the treaty arises under a commercial relationship for the purposes of Article I of the NYC (Belarus, the Kyrgyz Republic, and the UAE).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judge at [93] cites research undertaken by the Claimants&#8217; legal representatives revealing 30 occasions when the NYC has been applied to investor-State arbitral awards, 20 of them involving bilateral investment treaties, and most of the others concerned with the Energy Charter Treaty. A leading textbook states that as &#8220;&#8230; provided in Article 31(3) of the VCLT, in interpreting a treaty under Article 31, account is to be taken of any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation (Foxton et al, <span style="font-style:italic">Mustill &amp; Boyd, Commercial and Investor State Arbitration</span>, 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> edn, (2024), &#167;17.4). In submissions in the present case, the Claimants referred to &#8220;the astonishing implication [of India&#8217;s contention] that investor&#8211;State awards cannot be enforced against India under the NYC by any Contracting State&#8221;. I do not think that a clear answer was advanced on behalf of India to these points of practice. Even if there are indications in the travaux that the original intention was that the NYC would apply to private law disputes, the Convention proved to be a runaway success in the scope of its application, and there is some authority supporting an evolutionary approach to applying the treaty interpretation provisions of the VCLT (see <span style="font-style:italic">Basfar v Wong</span> [2022] UKSC 20 at [64-67]).

(I am told that an application for permission to appeal has not been ruled on yet by the High Court of Australia.) The decision is said to be misconceived (among other things) because India&#8217;s reservation was strictly territorial in nature and incapable of being applied on a reciprocal basis, and that the later provisions in the VCLT which entered into force in 1980 cannot alter the terms of the NYC.  The Claimants present the issue as a matter of the proper application of the relevant treaties, with other questions decided (where necessary) according to English law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, the issue is whether it is commercial under the Laws of India, and I am not convinced that the Court should determine the issue in this way.  In my view, there is some force in India&#8217;s contention that the Claimants have not advanced any case, or evidence as to whether the BIT awards arise &#8220;out of a legal relationship that is considered as commercial under the law of India.&#8221; For that reason alone, it is submitted, they have failed to discharge their burden of proving the alleged &#8220;prior agreement&#8221; under s.2.2 SIA.  The Claimants respond that India has itself not pleaded whether the dispute could be considered &#8220;commercial&#8221; as a matter of Indian law or submitted any evidence to that effect, which it is India&#8217;s burden to discharge. English law, therefore, the Claimants submit, applies by default: see <span style="font-style:italic">Brownlie v FS Cairo (Nile Plaza) LLC</span> [2022] AC 995 which deals with the presumption of similarity. The Claimants also submit that India raised this point for the first time in this jurisdiction in its skeleton argument, and there was no time to adduce any Indian law evidence. This is they say is why no timetable was set by Sir Nigel Teare for Indian law evidence under the s.2 question which it is common ground is (as noted above) a pure point of law. </p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">Brownlie</span> case makes clear that because the application of the presumption of similarity is fact-specific, it is impossible to state any hard and fast rules as to when it may properly be employed (at [143], Lord Leggatt JSC, with whom the other members of the Supreme Court agreed on the foreign law issue). The decision of Foxton J in <span style="font-style:italic">The Czech Republic v Diag Human SE and Stava</span> [2024] EWHC 2102 (Comm) at [43] is instructive as to the granular approach that may be required in such a case, albeit as regards a different question in that case. I appreciate that the Australian court decided the issue without such evidence, but I am inclined to think that on an issue that is so closely tied to the law of India, it would not be right for this court to decide the matter simply on the basis that Indian law is the same as English law. The MFN argument did not seem to me to advance the Claimants&#8217; case much.</p>

They submit that India&#8217;s consent has been given on a standing and continuous basis under the framework of the NYC to recognise and enforce arbitration agreements and awards to be made in the future between parties which are unidentified at the time that they gave their original consent. It is wrong to characterise the relevant consent as being at the point in time of ratification or limited to the point in time of ratification.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">India contends that this may apply to a BIT, but the NYC is an agreement between states. It only concerns the obligations of states to enforce. It says nothing about the state in its capacity as a party to an award, and there is nothing in the NYC to suggest some kind of continuing offer or agreement with a non-state.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have rejected the Claimants&#8217; contention that the NYC constitutes consent, so the premise of their contention does not exist.  But were the issue to arise, my view would be that India&#8217;s contention gives too little weight to the purpose of s. 23(3) as regards &#8220;proceedings&#8221; in respect of matters that occurred before the date of the coming into force of this Act.  The proceedings the Claimants have brought to enforce the Awards came long after 1978.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I answer this question as follows.  Section 2(2) of the UK&#8217;s State Immunity Act 1978 (SIA) provides that a state may submit to the jurisdiction of the UK courts by a prior written agreement.  I consider that by reason only of its ratification of the New York Convention 1958 (NYC), the Republic of India has not submitted to the jurisdiction, or to put it another way, ratification of the NYC by India does not in and of itself, and absent a valid arbitration agreement, amount to consent by way of a &#8220;prior written agreement&#8221; by the state waiving its immunity.  This is because (1) there is no indication that it was the intention of the drafters of the NYC to preclude immunity-based arguments in enforcement actions against states, and overall the commentary is to the effect that immunity-based arguments are not precluded, (2) applying the established classification of state immunity in English and international law, the reference to &#8220;rules of procedure&#8221; in Article III NYC preserves state immunity in its own terms, and (3) applying the test for waiver in English law, the ratification of Art III of the NYC is not, on its own, a waiver of state immunity by India.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Among the practical considerations behind this conclusion, in the context of arbitration, s.9 of the UK&#8217;s SIA specifically provides that where a state has agreed in writing to submit a dispute to arbitration it is not immune as respects proceedings which relate to the arbitration. In this case, India disputes the arbitration agreement, and there are proceedings in the Netherlands which is the seat of the arbitration. In principle, however, where there is an issue as to the effect or validity of the arbitration agreement, determination of the issue for state immunity purposes should be determinative for NYC purposes as well as avoiding duplication. In any event, the conclusion I have reached is not intended to contradict in any way the enforcement friendly aspect of the NYC, which is its purpose, and the reason for its success, and which has been consistently upheld in the English courts. It simply recognises that international jurisprudence, which holds that &#8220;&#8230; state immunity occupies an important place in international law and international relations&#8221;, also has to be taken into account in deciding the narrow, but important, issue of whether a state has by treaty given its consent to waive that immunity.</p>
