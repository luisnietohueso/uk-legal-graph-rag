In each case, the challenge is to the decisions of the Defendant Councils (&#8220;Bristol&#8221; and &#8220;Devon&#8221;) to enter into &#8220;Safety Valve Agreements&#8221; (&#8220;SVAs&#8221;) with the Department for Education (&#8220;DfE&#8221;), in March 2024.</p>

As is well known, substantial deficits in relation to the DSG have accumulated in many local authorities across the country, principally as a result of demand for SEND provision outstripping the funding allocated by central government. The DfE has introduced various measures to assist local authorities in tackling these deficits, including the Safety Valve Programme (&#8220;SVP&#8221;) pursuant to which SVAs were entered into until December 2024 when the SVP was suspended. Thirty eight local authorities are currently parties to SVAs.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SVAs have been described in these proceedings as &#8220;financial bailout&#8221; agreements. This reflects the fact that, under a SVA, the DfE agrees to make specified annual payments to the local authority over an agreed number of years to reduce the deficit on its DSG. In exchange, the local authority undertakes to reduce its deficit to a specified level at each financial year end, so that, with the help of the DfE payments, it is eliminated over the course of the agreement. The local authority also agrees to implement an &#8220;action plan&#8221; with a view to achieving this, and the continuation of the DfE&#8217;s payments is subject to continued satisfactory progress towards the agreed goals during the lifetime of the SVA. There are arrangements for monitoring, by the DfE, of the local authority&#8217;s performance in fulfilling the SVA and the agreement is subject to review at any time, including if the authority is making insufficient progress towards its financial targets.</p>

As a result of an extension in 2022 (see the Local Authorities (Capital Finance and Accounting) (England) (Amendment) (No 2) Regulations 2022), the override will continue to apply until the end of the 2025/26 financial year.

This required each local authority with a cumulative deficit of 1% or more at the end of the financial year to submit a recovery plan known as a Deficit Management Plan (&#8220;DMP&#8221;) outlining how it would bring its deficit back into balance in a three year time frame.

The DMP sets out steps which will be taken to bring the deficit under control by making savings, referred to as &#8220;mitigations&#8221;. It enables a local authority and the DfE to monitor how DSG funding is being spent by the authority; to compare data on high needs spending between authorities; and to form evidence based strategic plans for the provision of services for children and young people with SEND. It is continually updated and modified over time to reflect changes in demand, and the financial forecasts which it contains change on the basis of extrapolations from data as they become available. The figures are expected to require adjustment over time in response to changes in the population, in the complexity of the needs of children and young people and in national policy. The evidence of the Defendants is therefore that the DMP plans and forecasts are &#8220;by no means set in stone&#8221;.</p>

Moreover, the steps which Bristol will need to take in order to achieve the agreed targets in relation to in year and cumulative DSG deficits are a continuation of existing strategies including those identified by central government in its guidance (referred to above), albeit the proposals to implement these strategies have been developed further and there will be significant acceleration in the pace of change, partly as a result of additional funding for local/mainstream provision being unlocked.</p>

It was forecast to reach &#163;207 million by the end of the 2025/26 financial year. This was one of the highest DSG deficits in the country and the reasons for it included the fact that Devon has a higher number of pupils with EHCPs, and SEND children, than the national average. Devon children with EHCPs are also far more likely to be receiving private provision than resource base provision in mainstream schools.</p>

This involved reviewing existing DSG management and sustainability plans with the help of specialist advisers. Devon had already identified 19 possible projects in the course of the previous unsuccessful negotiations to enter into a SVA and each of these was assessed against its impact on children, its ability to deliver savings to high needs spending and the risk it posed to Devon discharging its statutory duties. Each project was also given a risk assessment rating which reflected the level of confidence that it could be delivered. Through this process, a final list of projects was agreed and these were then developed into more detailed delivery plans. There was then work on a financial plan which would enable Devon to achieve financial sustainability and Devon then adopted its &#8220;SEND Transformation Plan&#8221; which brought together its Ofsted/CQC improvement work and the proposals in the DMP.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Broach also accepted that in general the decision, under section 27, as to whether to carry out a review is a matter for the local authority subject to intervention by the court on <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> grounds. He gave the example of a complaint (such as in <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">R (ZK) v London Borough of Redbridge</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> [2019] EWHC 1450 (Admin), [2019] ELR 482 &#8211; &#8220;the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Redbridge</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> case&#8221;</span>) about the local authority not having carried out a review for a long time, or decisions about the authority&#8217;s programme or approach to when it carries out reviews, or about what the review process should involve (provided there is compliance with section 27(3)), as being subject to <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> rationality standards. But, he contended, this is  not the position in &#8220;a trigger case&#8221; where it is argued on the facts that the nature of the local authority&#8217;s decision is such that section 27 compels a review before the decision is taken. If it is said that there has been a trigger event then the court must decide for itself whether this is so. He submitted that this view is clearly supported by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">R (D) v Hackney London Borough Council</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> [2020] EWCA Civ 518, [2020] PTSR 1587 (&#8220;the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Hackney</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> case&#8221;) and, in particular, the judgment of Bean LJ at </span>[48] with whom Baker LJ and Cobb J agreed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Broach&#8217;s case that the obligation to carry out a review had been triggered in the present cases was based on the fact that year on year reductions in spending on SEND, as compared with what had been projected, were required if the Defendants were to achieve their target annual deficit figures agreed under their SVAs. He also emphasised the scale of those reductions:</p>

The level of savings needed increased in subsequent years. Based on the available information (which was incomplete) Mr Broach estimated that a total reduction of more than 20% was required, spread over the nine years of the agreement.</p>

Whilst the actions under the SVA were not set in stone, the agreements required a detailed plan which, at the very least, set a direction of travel for changes to SEND provision. The plans entailed system wide transformation which would inevitably impact on how SEND assistance was provided by each of the authorities. Indeed, in both cases comprehensive sufficiency plans had been developed alongside the safety valve application which, in turn, had impacted on the strategy adopted. Consideration of sufficiency was required by the DfE template and, in the case of Devon, sufficiency was one of four themes in its action plan.</p>

He confirmed in his oral submissions that he was not contending that the Defendants would fail to comply with their statutory obligations in relation to individual children and young people with SEND, and he submitted that it was not necessary for him to show that the decision to enter the SVA would cause significant disadvantage. It was enough that a strategic decision as to global SEND provision was being made which involved major reductions in spending and an associated transformation in the approach to provision. Moreover, an authority could not rationally conclude that there would be no disadvantage or adverse effect without, first, carrying out a global review of sufficiency.</p>

This was the effect of his primary position (summarised above) but he also pointed out that there was no evidence that either Bristol or Devon had considered their obligations under section 27 as opposed to other types of consultation. There was therefore no decision to which the court should accord deference and he challenged each of the grounds on which the local authorities argued that their approach was justified. They had, however, recognised that sufficiency of provision was an issue and had modelled accordingly and yet they failed to consult as part of this.</p>

Nor were they capable of discharging the obligations which it imposed on a local authority. Section 27 consultation is at a global strategic level, and is therefore different in nature to the consultation which had been carried out by Bristol and Devon. The section also imposes an additional obligation to the local authority&#8217;s other statutory obligations to consult in relation to decisions concerning individual children and young people or to consult the Schools Forum or to consult in relation to its local offer. It would be irrational to hold that a local authority can avoid its section 27(3) duty by consultation which was not compliant with that subsection.</p>

He argued that, given the magnitude and effect of the decision to enter the SVAs in these cases, if the duty to carry out a review was not triggered it is difficult to see how it ever will be given that detailed decisions on specific proposals are unlikely to engage section 27 because they are not decisions about global provision.</p>

He argues from this premise that there was an obligation to conduct a review in the circumstances of the present case and that if one had been conducted there would have been an obligation to consult as part of that review. Mr Broach also built on this foundation to argue that consultation about specific measures was irrelevant in the context of section 27 given that the section was concerned with consultation as part of a global or strategic review, which was a materially different process involving consultation on materially different matters.</p>

Looked at in this way, there might be circumstances in which it would be irrational not to consult &#8211; e.g. an event of a nature which compelled the local authority to ascertain the views of the specified parties as to the sufficiency of provision - but the notion of a requirement to carry out a &#8220;global strategic review&#8221; being &#8220;triggered&#8221; would seem somewhat artificial in the context of the section read as a whole. Moreover it would not follow from the fact that sufficiency of provision was considered by a local authority that there was necessarily an obligation to carry out a review: it would be for the authority to consider whether and when to consult, subject to rationality standards.</p>

The issue was as to whether it is for the courts to determine whether such circumstances have arisen or whether it is for the local authority, subject to <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> irrationality standards. In my view it is the latter. Whether the obligation is to carry out a review from time to time, or to consult from time to time as part of keeping the relevant provision under consideration, it would go against the grain of the section for the question of a trigger to be an issue for the courts to determine on the facts. In my view, and consistently with the views expressed in the <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic">Redbridge</span> cases, section 27 leaves to the local authority the decisions as to how to keep provision under review and whether and when to consult the specified parties as to this question.

If that is right, and I agree that it is, I cannot see how the same statutory provision can be read as saying that if there is an alleged trigger event decisions as to how to keep provision under review are a matter for the courts. Although it may be said that there is a difference between deciding what steps should be taken as a matter of general forward planning or routine and what steps should be taken in the context of a specific event, both are ultimately decisions as to how the duty under section 27 should be discharged. I do not accept that there is any basis in the text of the section for the distinction which Mr Broach sought to draw.</p>

This is the correct interpretation of the terms of the SVAs taking into account the evidence of the witnesses who provided statements in these proceedings, including Mr Goldman, and the DfE template monitoring forms which the Defendants agreed, in section 4 of the SVA, to fill out as part of the process of determining whether satisfactory progress under the SVA was being made. These forms extract the measures set out in section 3 of each SVA and require the authority to explain the position in relation to each measure. The form does not measure progress against the more specific schemes and projects set out in the DMPs.</p>

I have quoted them in full at [42] and [82] above and need not repeat them. But it is obvious that they are capable of implementation in a variety of different ways and that the manner of their implementation is a matter for the local authority to decide.</p>

This is also the evidence of the Defendants&#8217; witnesses. The DMPs are not <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;set in stone&#8221;</span>, whether as a result of entering into the SVA or otherwise. As I have pointed out, they are also expressed in broad terms and require the detail to be worked out before they can be implemented on the ground.</p>

That provision would be assessed in the usual way on the basis of the needs of the particular child or young person, and decisions on these matters would be susceptible to appeal to the FTT. The Defendants&#8217; decisions to enter into the SVAs would not, in themselves, result in <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;cuts&#8221;</span> in the sense of existing individual provision being withdrawn, reduced or altered or any provision being denied if this was contrary to the requirements of the 2014 Act.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourthly, true it is that the SVAs required savings to be made in the years to which they applied, but this was as compared with the then projected levels of spending, and spending was forecast to rise over the coming years as demand for SEND provision continued to increase. This was about controlling the increase in spending and the DSG deficit. Moreover, broadly, the savings were to be achieved by early intervention to prevent needs from becoming more complex, best practice in terms of inclusion in mainstream schools and increasing the levels of provision which would be available in the maintained sector. In other words, the needs of children and young people would continue to be met but by means which were more cost effective and, where provision was local, more convenient for the pupil or their family. The method of provision might well change where this was consistent with the Defendants&#8217; statutory obligations but the premise for the SVAs was that they would be obliged to continue to comply with these obligations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fifthly, entering into the SVA resulted in substantial sums being unlocked for SEND provision. The DfE made payments which reduced the authorities&#8217; DSG deficits but it also agreed to the release of funds for investment in provision. The authorities were obliged to deliver on their side of the bargain if the annual DfE payments were to continue. But they were clearly obliged to take steps to address their DSG deficits whether or not they entered into an SVA given the size and implications of those deficits, and given the general conditions attached to the DSG. It is not easy to see a major downside for the Defendants in entering into the SVAs given that the worst that could happen would be that the DfE payments were discontinued and I agree that the authorities could rationally consider, as they did, that there would be no significant adverse impact from entering the SVAs per se. The impact would depend on decisions which the authorities themselves took to implement the actions and achieve the financial objectives which they had agreed, and these would be the subject of consultation or public engagement where appropriate.</p>

The strategic objectives which underpinned these measures &#8211; such as early intervention and greater local and mainstream or maintained provision &#8211; were also well known and understood given that they had been the subject of guidance from central government and had been under discussion for some time. Although there was to be an acceleration of the process of change and there were some new specific ideas for achieving the stated objectives, the DMPs built on work which had been ongoing for some time and had been part of the discourse about how to approach SEND provision and the DSG deficits. These matters would also be the subject of consultation and public engagement in the future, as I have said.</p>

It was perfectly rational for them to decide that they need not consult at this stage, given this, given the overall beneficial nature of the SVAs as summarised above, given their intention to consult on the specific proposals which would implement these objectives, and given their ability to alter these proposals or introduce new proposals over the course of the agreements. It was not the case that, by entering into the SVAs, the authorities irrevocably bound themselves to a particular set of proposals, and the achievement of particular levels of savings by those proposals, &#8220;come what may&#8221;.</p>

The question arising from Mr Broach&#8217;s argument on Ground 1 is whether the authorities could rationally conclude that they need not conduct such a review and consult in the context of such a review because they had a good awareness of the views of stakeholders on the relevant strategic objectives, and because they would consult on the specifics in due course. In my view that question is answered in the affirmative.</p>

As I have noted, Mr Broach was clear that he was not arguing that there had been a section 27 review, including consideration of the sufficiency of provision; his argument was that there ought to have been one.</span></p>

The former consideration, the need for confidentiality, appears to have been a perception rather than the reality being that the DfE would not have permitted consultation if either of the authorities had wished to undertake it. The latter argument assumed that a review/consultation could not have been commenced sufficiently soon after the DfE&#8217;s invitation to bid for a SVA, an assumption which I did not consider to be justified on the evidence.</span></p>

This proposition was said by Mr Goudie to be established by four authorities: <span style="font-style:italic">R (Fawcett Society) v Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> [2010] EWHC 3522 (Admin); <span style="font-style:italic">R (JG) v Lancashire County Council </span>[2011] EWHC 2295; <span style="font-style:italic">R (A) v Oxfordshire County Council</span> [2016] EWHC 2419 (Admin) and the <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey</span> case (supra) at [83]-[85].

She submitted, correctly, that as the EIA had not been provided to Cabinet for the purposes of its decision to ratify the SVA, and as the PSED is non delegable, the EIA could not be relied on by Devon as evidence of &#8220;due regard&#8221;. There had been no witness evidence on this topic from any member of Cabinet and the only evidence of consideration of the relevant matters was therefore what appeared in the December and the March reports (set out above at [63]). This was woefully inadequate given the enormity of the implications of entering into the SVA. It amounted to &#8220;kicking the can down the road&#8221; in that the proposal was to consider the equality implications at a later stage, and the suggestion that the results of entering into the SVA would be entirely positive was &#8220;Panglossian&#8221;.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">The authorities show that the concept of "due regard" is highly sensitive to facts and context. How intense the "regard" must be to satisfy the requirements in section 149 will depend on the circumstances of the decision-making process in which the duty is engaged. What is "due regard" in one case will not necessarily be "due regard" in another. It will vary, perhaps widely, according to circumstances: for example, the subject-matter of the decision being made, the timing of that decision, its place in a sequence of decision-making to which it belongs, the period for which it will be in effect, the nature and scale of its potential consequences, and so forth. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">When the decision comes at an early stage in a series of decisions, and will not fix once and for all the impacts on people with protected characteristics, the level of assessment required to qualify as "due regard" is likely to be less demanding than if the decision is final or permanent. This may especially be so if the decision is also experimental, and is itself conducive to a more robust assessment of equality impacts later in the process</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having said this, it seems to me that the key to Ground 2 is the true characterisation and implications of the decision of Devon to enter the SVA, and the fact that Devon&#8217;s proposals were based on matters which had been under discussion and consideration for some time, as to which I have made findings at [120] to [130], above, in particular. In my view the SVA and, indeed, the DMP did state the authority&#8217;s proposals at a high degree of generality. The achievement of future savings was very much dependent on the specifics of whether and how the agreed objectives would be implemented &#8220;on the ground&#8221;, as to which there was a high degree of flexibility. The view of the authority was expressly (see 10.1 of the December/March reports) that at the stage of entering into the SVA the implications were not sufficiently specific, that there may be equalities issues for children with disabilities and that the equality implications would be considered further in detail in relation to any changes to provision. This view was consistent with the approach which it adopted to the question of consultation which, of course, would potentially help to identify equality issues when the time came. I do not accept that this amounted to a failure to have &#8220;due regard&#8221; to the relevant matters given the stage which Devon had reached  in the decision making process. Regard was paid to them and, having done so, the view was taken that it would be necessary to consider the implications of specific proposals and at the appropriate time. In my view, this was sufficient to discharge the PSED, at least in relation to the decision to enter into the SVA.</p>

This is that Devon recognised that there may be equality implications but decided to consider this question further in the context of specific proposals when they were formulated in detail and/or were due to be implemented. Devon did not decide that it need not pay any or any further regard to any equality implications because there was no possibility of any adverse equality related consequence for anyone as a result of entering the SVA. Moreover, a fair reading of what was said in the two reports was that it was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;hoped&#8221;</span> that increasing mainstream inclusion and local SEND places would have a positive impact on pupils/students and their families for reasons which were explained in the reports i.e. they would go to school nearer their homes. It was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;expected&#8221;</span> that early intervention and greater inclusion would improve opportunities for children. The <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;combined overall&#8221;</span> impacts were seen to be positive. In my view there was nothing &#8220;Panglossian&#8221; about these high level views of the impact of entering into the SVA which was, itself, a high level agreement. As I have said, such views were rationally open to Devon.</p>

And yet, under the SVA, Devon agreed to move from a projected DSG deficit for 2023/24 of c&#163;37 million to achieving an in year balance in terms of funding and spending in 2026/27 i.e. in the space of three years.</p>

But it was not told, for example, what work had been done to comply with the DfE guidance on how to manage HNB spending or to comply with Devon&#8217;s statutory best value duties, or what the reasons were for the characteristics of the Devon population which led to the particularly high levels of EHCPs etc. Cabinet was not given any information as to whether what Ms Patry called the proposed &#8220;cuts&#8221; were being suggested against a background of Devon having already made as many savings as it could, nor any understanding of whether there might be reasons why its SEND population might be different to other authorities.</p>

For example, it was apparent from the DMP that Devon was projecting cuts/savings of &#163;15.345 million for 2024/25 but Cabinet was not given the information which would enable it to be aware of this. Indeed, on Ms Patry&#8217;s calculation, it was implicit in the reports which were provided to Cabinet (if a member of Cabinet had chosen to carry out the same calculation) that savings of significantly less money - &#163;7 million - were projected in order to achieve the agreed targets. (This figure was disputed by Devon but, in any event, Ms Patry&#8217;s central point was that Cabinet was not given the figures as to required savings). Cabinet needed to consider whether the proposed savings were workable and what their impacts would be, and yet it was not put in a position to do this. She also suggested that Cabinet would need to consider whether there would be costs shifting to the adult care budget.</p>

For example, it was inconceivable that increasing the special school estate would deliver significant savings in the near future, and certainly not within one financial year, given the time required to develop and implement the proposals. Increasing resource bases, similarly, required consultation and would take time. It might be that applications for further funding were being made but they had not been determined and it was speculative to assume that they would be granted. The DMP forecasted particular savings for particular headline projects but it was not provided to Cabinet and, in any event, it raises significant questions about how the savings would be achieved in practice. These were questions about which the Cabinet ought reasonably to have been informed, and which it ought to have considered, before entering into the SVA. The lack of information about these matters was the very thing which had caused at least one councillor on the Children&#8217;s Scrutiny Committee, on 24 March 2024, to complain about the lack of specifics in the information presented to decision makers and that, as a result, the Committee was struggling to understand where the savings would be made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, Cabinet should be taken to have had a reasonable degree of awareness of the context in any event as it is quite apparent from the evidence that the DSG deficit had been an ongoing issue for some time. But, as I have highlighted above, Cabinet was also given information as to this in the December report, in the slides which accompanied it and in the figures with which it was provided in the December and March reports. These figures showed that there had been substantial in year deficits in the preceding 5 years, that the accumulated deficit had increased over this period and was very substantial (c&#163;163 million for 2023/24) and that it was forecast to increase substantially (to c&#163;207 million) in the relatively near future. In the December slide presentation they were given information as to the causes of the increase in spending in terms of higher numbers of EHCPs, more complex cases and greater use of private and out of area provision etc. It was implicit that this had happened despite the authority&#8217;s best efforts to date, but it was also clear that the proposal was to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;reform&#8221;</span> Devon&#8217;s high needs system to achieve the necessary savings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, as far as the specifics of the savings required are concerned, it was plain - from the figures and other information which Cabinet was given in the December and the March reports - that there would need to be reform, and substantial savings would need to be made. It is true that Cabinet was not given specific figures for the savings which would need to be made in each year to which the SVA applied in order to achieve the agreed cumulative deficit targets. However, the figures in the December report showed the funding, spend and therefore overspend in each year from 2019/20-2023/24 (forecast) as well as the cumulative deficit. The figures showed in year deficits of in the order of &#163;37/38 million in the preceding two financial years. As Ms Patry points out, the forecast for 2023/24 itself was for an in year deficit of c&#163;37 million, and a cumulative deficit at that stage of &#163;162.585 million. The March report stated in terms that there would have to be a positive in year balance in the third year after the SVA and in all years thereafter. The scale of the challenge was therefore clear.</p>

There were also figures which showed the contributions from different sources which Devon would be required to make over the period of the agreement so as to bring the forecast accumulated deficit down to &#163;95 million in 2031/32, and therefore to zero when the DfE&#8217;s payments were taken into account.</p>

In the December report it was told what the intended impact/strategic objectives were (i.e. slowing down the increase in EHCPs, a reduction in the use of private provision and an increase in provision in mainstream schools). Cabinet was also told that the proposals would need to be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;constantly reviewed and other initiatives may be brought forward through continued performance and risk management&#8221;</span> and it was told that there would be consultation in relation to proposed service changes or other developments such as new special schools or resource base provision.</p>

They were told, in effect, that a good deal of work had been done on the proposals in conjunction with DfE officials, and the March report told them in terms that the DfE was assured on the question of the feasibility of the action plan and the financial targets which Devon was agreeing to achieve. Cabinet therefore was looking at the matter on the basis that there had been careful consideration of the proposals over a significant period of time and the specialist/expert view of all who were involved was that they were workable. Indeed, the DfE would not have agreed to the payment and unlocking of what were very significant sums if it had considered otherwise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course, a member of Cabinet might have asked for more information on what savings would need to be made, more detail on how it was proposed that they would be achieved and how likely it was that the proposed reforms would succeed. But they could perfectly rationally take the view that they did not need additional detail about these or any other matters in order to decide whether it was in Devon&#8217;s interests to enter the SVA. The need to take steps to address the deficit was clear, well understood and pressing. It was clear that it would be necessary to make substantial savings, that reform would be required and that success could not be guaranteed. But the proposals had been approved by the DfE. For the reasons which I have given above, members of Cabinet could rationally consider that the SVA was an essentially beneficial opportunity to take steps which needed to be taken in any event whilst receiving financial assistance from central government and being permitted to invest other sums in order to make progress. The downside to not going ahead with it at that point was a great deal more obvious than the downside to entering into it, even if ultimately it was not as successful as was hoped.</p>

She relied on <span style="font-style:italic">R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union</span> [2017] UKSC 5, [2018] AC 61 at [51] where the Supreme Court said that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;ministers cannot frustrate the purpose of a statute or a statutory provision, for example by emptying it of content or preventing its operation&#8221;</span> including in the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;exercise of prerogative powers</span>&#8221;. Her argument was that section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972 and section 1 of the Localism Act 2011, pursuant to which Bristol and Devon may be taken to have acted in entering into their SVAs, could be treated as analogous to prerogative powers for the purposes of this principle.</p>

I was therefore very doubtful that the analogy which she sought to draw was apt. Although I could see the force of the argument that, in principle, in a given case Parliament, in statute B, might not have conferred a power to take a given step which was contrary to or frustrated earlier statute A, whether this was so would turn on the construction of statute B. I agree with Mr Jackson that Ms Patry had not pleaded or argued Ground 4 on the basis of a careful analysis of sections 111 of the 1972 Act and/or 1 of the 2011 Act. I would therefore have been reluctant to determine this point given that the way in which the proposition was presented on behalf of JX led to a lack of detailed argument on the true issues.</p>

Even that was contested by Devon. She did not submit, and nor could she, that it was an inevitable consequence of the SVA that Devon would fail to comply with its obligations in any particular case, or likely that this would happen on a wider scale. Mr Broach expressly stated that it was not his case that these would be the consequences and, as I have accepted, in fact the SVAs were entered into on the basis that this would not in any way permit the authorities to fail to comply with their duties to individual children and young persons under Part 3 of the 2014 Act. On the contrary, the aim of the SVA was to enable Devon to comply with its obligations more cost effectively and to improve its SEND provision. If frustration of Part 3 was a likely or intended consequence of entering into the SVA the DfE would have declined to approve Devon&#8217;s proposal. Moreover, the FTT would also be on hand to police the 2014 Act and prevent any breaches of its requirements.</p>

Looking at it in another way, given Ms Patry&#8217;s (correct) concessions, and in any event, she was unable to establish the proposition that the broad language of section 111 and section 1 did not encompass a power on the part of Devon to enter into a SVA because of the effect which doing so would have on its ability to fulfil its duties under Part 3 of the 2014 Act.

In relation to promptness, there is a degree of artificiality about considering how I would have exercised my discretion in relation to permission had I considered that a ground or grounds had merit: it is likely that my view would have been influenced by the question of which grounds and how strong they were. As far as the argument under section 31(2A), (3C) and (3D) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 is concerned, again the assessment of the likelihood of a different outcome would depend on which ground or combination of grounds was found arguably to have merit, what would have been required in order for Devon to have acted lawfully and what the outcome would have been. The question of exceptional public interest then might or might not have needed to be addressed. Unless good reason is suggested to the contrary, then, I do not think it necessary or proportionate to enter into these hypothetical questions.</p>

There are additional reasons for declining to do so in the case of section 31(6) or as a matter of discretion, namely the fact that the effect of granting a quashing order, whether a prospective quashing order or otherwise, would be relevant to the exercise of my discretion.
