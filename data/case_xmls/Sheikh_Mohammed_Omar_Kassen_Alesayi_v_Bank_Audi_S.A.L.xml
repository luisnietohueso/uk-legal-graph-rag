The appellant/defendant (the<span style="font-weight:bold"> &#8220;appellant</span>&#8221; or the<span style="font-weight:bold"> &#8220;Bank</span>&#8221;) is a joint stock company based in Beirut, Lebanon that provides banking services (&#8220;S.A.L.&#8221; denoting &#8220;Societ&#233; Anonyme Libanaise&#8221;, a recognised Lebanese corporate structure). The appellant is represented by Mr Wilson KC and Ms Zaman of counsel; the respondent by Mr Friedman and Mr Bartscherer of counsel.

By a letter dated 22 August 2022, the respondent asked the Bank to transfer certain of his funds to bank accounts at his nomination in Switzerland. By a letter dated 5 September 2022, the Bank refused to comply with the transfer request. The respondent states that he is a consumer domiciled in the UK and has a consumer contract for banking services with the appellant. As such, and because the appellant directed banking services to the UK, he maintains, he is entitled to serve the appellant out of the jurisdiction as of right. He seeks, as a matter of Lebanese law, a mandatory order (specific performance) from this court requiring the appellant to transfer the full USD balances from Lebanon to his nominated accounts in Geneva. </p>

It filed a jurisdiction challenge under CPR Part 11 on 25 July 2023.  The Bank relies on the terms of the banking contract which contain, it is said, an exclusive jurisdiction agreement in favour of the Lebanese courts. The Bank maintains that the claim is in fundamental breach of contract. I note, as stated in the much-cited case of <span style="font-style:italic">Pammer v Reederei Karl Schluter GmbH &amp; Co AG; Hotel Alpenhof GesmbH v Heller Joined cases </span>(C-585/08 &amp; C-144/09) EU:C:2010:740 (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Pammer</span>&#8221;),<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>that to satisfy the directed activities test, there is no requirement for the trader (here the Bank) to direct the activities &#8220;in a substantial way&#8221; (para 82). The disclosure goes to this contested component of the jurisdiction question: whether the defendant directed activities to England and Wales. I add that a further dispute is whether the respondent is domiciled in this jurisdiction. The respondent served the Bank out of the jurisdiction under section 15B(2)(b) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (&#8220;the 1982 Act&#8221;). Fundamental to jurisdiction is the &#8220;Activities Requirement&#8221; under section 15E and in particular subsection (1)(c): </p>

First, this is one of several similar claims in which claimants with funds in Lebanese financial institutions have come to this court seeking various forms of relief, animated by the banking crisis in Lebanon (see jurisdiction challenges in <span style="font-style:italic">Khalifeh v Blom Bank SAL </span>[2021] EWHC 3399 (QB) (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Khalifeh</span>&#8221;); <span style="font-style:italic">Bitar v Banque Libano-Francaise SAL </span>[2021] EWHC 2787 (QB); <span style="font-style:italic">Kalo v Bankmed SAL </span>[2024] EWHC 2606 (Comm) (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Kalo</span>&#8221;)). This extensively documented financial crisis came to a head in 2019 and resulted in de facto restrictions on the transfer of foreign currency out of Lebanon. The crisis, much commented on internationally, has been summarised by this court in several judgments. I gratefully adopt the account provided by Picken J as at March 2022 (<span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Manoukian v. Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale de Banque au Liban and Bank Audi SAL</span><span style="color:#000000">&#160;</span>[2022] EWHC 669 (QB)), proximate in time to the sealing of this appellant&#8217;s claim form on 22 February 2023, and some five months prior to the claimant&#8217;s transfer request to the Bank. Picken J said at paras 20-22:</p>

When the banks reopened on 1 November 2019, there was a run on all Lebanese banks, with large numbers of clients attempting to withdraw all their foreign currency or transfer it all abroad.</span></p>

This is because Lebanese banks rely heavily on the Banque du Liban ('BdL'), the central bank, for their foreign currency liquidity. As the crisis unfolded, however, it meant that BdL could in practice 'turn off the taps' by restricting Lebanese banks' access to their foreign currency deposits for international transfers. The net result is that the Banks (along with all other Lebanese banks) have been operating with severe foreign currency shortages since October 2019. Lebanon's economic turmoil and political unrest have worsened since then, the Lebanese pound (LBP) having lost 90% of its value amid dwindling confidence in the Lebanese economy, which has itself shrunk by 40% &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

There the claimant (then plaintiff) <span style="color:#1F1F1F">applied for an order for disclosure (&#8220;discovery&#8221;) of documents in an action against Punjab National Bank (&#8220;PNB&#8221;) for repayment of monies paid under insurance contracts. PNB contended that it had no place of business in Great Britain when the writ was served and disputed the court's jurisdiction. The court dismissed the disclosure application. Where the question of proper service is raised, the plaintiff had to establish it had been properly effected as a prerequisite to provide the court with the necessary jurisdiction. While the court had jurisdiction to make the disclosure order sought, it would only exercise such power rarely and required the clearest possible demonstration that discovery was necessary for fair disposal of the application. The court was inherently reluctant to place such a burden on a defendant which disputed jurisdiction. Further, applications for discovery, if commonly pursued, were likely to lead to delay and expense. The applicant/plaintiff failed to show that the order was necessary for the fair disposal of the application.</span></p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.95in">&#8220;I wish to stress that, as counsel for the plaintiffs himself accepts, the court will only exercise its powers under this heading very rarely, and will require the clearest possible demonstration from the party seeking discovery that it is necessary for the fair disposal of the application. I say this for two reasons. In the first place, the court is naturally reluctant to place such a burden on a defendant who disputes the basic jurisdiction of the court, for the reasons put forward by counsel for the defendant. Secondly, applications under Ord 12, r 8 are a fairly common feature of court business, most particularly in the Commercial Court when dealing with applications to set aside leave granted ex parte under Ord 11 for service out of the jurisdiction, and they are normally dealt with by a hearing on affidavit evidence (see The Supreme Court Practice 1988 vol 1, para 12/7&#8211;8/5). It would be most undesirable, and productive of extra delay and unnecessary expense, if applications for discovery were to become a common feature in such cases.&#8221;</p>

However, it is necessary to examine what was decided by the Supreme Court. It was not a determination of the applicable test for disclosure in a jurisdiction challenge. <span style="font-style:italic">Vedanta</span> was about a quite different issue: the application of article 4 of Parliament and Council Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012, and whether it conferred a right on any claimant, regardless of their domicile, to sue an English domiciled defendant in England free from jurisdictional challenge upon forum non conveniens grounds, even where the competing candidate for jurisdiction was a non-member state. There the rival candidate forum was Zambia, where the alleged tort exclusively occurred and all the claimants resided. The issue is strikingly different to what I am considering. Further, as noted, Lord Briggs made clear (para 43) that no order for disclosure was asked for or granted. How then should this court understand the references to exceptional circumstances? The case of <span style="font-style:italic">Athena Capital Fund SICAW-FIS SCA and others v Secretariat of the State for the Holy See</span> [2022] 1 WLR 4570 (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Athena</span>&#8221;) was put before me. It is not a disclosure case, but about a stay of proceedings under the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction, recognised by section 49(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981. I make three observations about it.  </p>

After all, the usual function of a court is to decide cases and not to decline to do so, and access to justice is a fundamental principle under both the common law and Article 6 ECHR. The court will therefore need a powerful reason to depart from its usual course and such cases will by their nature be exceptional. In my judgment all of the guidance in the cases which I have cited is valuable and instructive, but the single test remains whether in the particular circumstances it is in the interests of justice for a case management stay to be granted.

However, the analogy is a formidable one: warning against the dangers of promoting comments by the court made by an eminent jurist in an earlier case into the applicable test. Observations about unusualness, exceptionality or rarity without more should not be substituted for the applicable test, accurate though they may be about the black swan occurrence of cases that in fact meet the test.

Satisfying the two-stage test is &#8220;out of the norm&#8221; because the two-stage test is hard to meet. The decided cases show this. In <span style="font-style:italic">Rome</span>, Hirst J refused disclosure because the applicant failed on the stage one prima facie element. Andrew Baker J observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Al Khattiya</span> that demonstrating whether the circumstances meet the stage two requirement will only arise in &#8220;unusual&#8221; circumstances.

Instead, Lord Briggs noted that &#8220;limited disclosure&#8221; may be ordered &#8220;in exceptional circumstances&#8221;.

This is reflected in the relatively low gateway threshold, vis. a plausible evidential basis, as well as vocal discouragement of jurisdictional appeals. There are frequent observations as to the scale of material and number of authorities cited by parties on challenges of this kind. (As an aside, I note that 26 authorities, plus procedural and statutory provisions, were cited by counsel for this hearing listed for two hours, which estimate is required to include giving of judgment and dealing with consequential matters.)&#8221;</p>

I recognise that there must be the &#8220;clearest possible demonstration&#8221; that the disclosure sought is necessary for the just disposal of the application. If this arduous element, which is materially equivalent to the reasonable necessity test, is not met, there should not be disclosure. Necessity is a hard test to meet.  It is not met by evidence that may assist or support the party&#8217;s case generally. The test is far more demanding. The court&#8217;s intrusive and coercive power can only be exercised if disclosure is necessary rather than desirable. This feeds into the &#8220;pragmatism&#8221; the appellant justifiably proposes: this is an interlocutory application and is invariably determined on the written evidence. This is why in <span style="font-style:italic">Spiliada </span>[1987] AC 460, 465, Lord Templeman hoped that submissions on forum would be &#8220;measured in hours and not days&#8221;.

It is self-defeating if, in order to determine whether an action should proceed to trial in this jurisdiction, the parties prepare for and conduct a hearing which approaches the putative trial itself, in terms of effort, time and cost. There is also a real danger that, if the hearing is an expensive and time-consuming exercise, it will be used by a richer party to wear down a poorer party, or by a party with a weak case to prevent, or at least to discourage, a party with a strong case from enforcing its rights.</p>

But the preventing of the court exercising an &#8220;exorbitant&#8221; jurisdiction, as the appellant pithily styles it, finds effective restraint by the demanding threshold of the two-stage test. </p>

It originated in the precise formulation of the court&#8217;s pre-CPR disclosure powers and has never been overturned. I find that references to exceptional circumstances underline, with indubitable factual accuracy, the difficulty of meeting the legal requirements for disclosure in a jurisdiction challenge. Exceptionality is descriptive, not definitional; predictive of frequency, not the definitive test. Instead, the legal requirements are the two-stage test enunciated in <span style="font-style:italic">Rome</span> by Hirst J and applied by this court thereafter from the late 1980s until the 2020s without once being doubted or reversed. In fairness to the Judge, she recognised the difficulties and high hurdles confronting a party seeking disclosure in a jurisdiction challenge:</p>

She did not make a finding of exceptionality. She did not have to. While it might have been better to rehearse the rival arguments for and against the primacy of an exceptionality test, the Judge undoubtedly identified the correct and cardinal two-stage test. There is no special doctrine of exceptionality. Therefore, the challenges to the twin orders below (McCloud and Armstrong), to the extent that they are based on the alleged misidentification of the legal test governing CPR 31.12, fail. </p>

Lord Neuberger said at para 13 that &#8220;it would be inappropriate for an appellate court to reverse or otherwise interfere with [a case management decision]&#8221;, unless it was &#8220;plainly wrong in the sense of being outside the generous ambit where reasonable decision makers may disagree.&#8221; Lord Neuberger emphasised that whether or not a judge at first instance had erroneously taken into account a factor was &#8220;not&#8230; the essential question&#8221;. Instead, the question was whether the decision was outside the generous ambit allowed to the Judge. Therefore, an appeal court should interfere where the Judge exceeded the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible (<span style="font-style:italic">Manning v Stylianou</span> [2006] EWCA Civ 1655) at para 19).  This court&#8217;s approach is not substitutionary (<span style="font-style:italic">Piglowska</span>) and the high threshold before appellate interference acts as an essential self-denying ordinance. </p>

It is evident that all the witness did was collate and tabulate the &#8220;readout&#8221; from the Bank&#8217;s systems. For CPR 31.14 purposes, I do not consider him to have directly or indirectly &#8220;mentioned&#8221; (or alluded to) the customer files themselves. I find that the Judge materially erred in her application of CPR 31.14. If the reference to &#8220;records&#8221; in the Judge&#8217;s order at 1a is to the data, that has been disclosed. If it is a reference to the underlying customer files, which appears to be the thrust of para 64, that is plainly wrong. The underlying customer files are not &#8220;mentioned&#8221; for CPR 31.14 purposes. That was neither an accurate nor reasonable conclusion.  The Judge continued at para 65:</p>

I find that the Judge was &#8220;wrong&#8221; in appellate terms in concluding that the test was met.

The choice of language reflected the reality that many of Bank Saradar&#8217;s local target clientele were French speakers, this being a common language of choice among the more educated strata of Lebanese society who were likely to be potential clients of Bank Saradar, and Arabic on the basis that this is the official language of Lebanon, and appropriate for clients from the Gulf. Later, English was also used increasingly to target customers in the Gulf.&#8221;</p>

The purpose of his mentioning the &#8220;materials&#8221; was to support the Bank&#8217;s case that the UK was not &#8220;targeted&#8221; (subject of directed activities).

The Judge was careful to limit the time period to 12 months and in the order confined the disclosable documents to those referring to London or the UK.

That is not the case. The claimant sought disclosure on the alternative basis of CPR 31.12 (&#8220;Regardless, they should be disclosed under CPR 31.12&#8221;.) There can be no procedural impropriety in the Judge considering the alternative basis. However, on this part of the application, I find that the Judge has not or not properly applied the applicable <span style="font-style:italic">Rome</span> stage 2 reasonable necessity. There is the need for an evidential foundation beyond mere conjecture to infer that the disclosure is relevant to the directed activities issue. However, there is no evidence that on merger there was a change of terms. Such information as exists points in the opposite direction. In its response to a CPR Part 18 request, the Bank stated:</p>

There was therefore no need for the Bank to enter into a new contract with the Claimant and there is accordingly no such document. In these circumstances, your request for copies of the &#8216;Merger Terms and Conditions&#8217; (whatever precisely that may mean) is equally devoid of merit. We reiterate that the Bank has provided you with copies of all relevant contractual documentation.&#8221;</p>

Therefore, there is no evidential foundation that the document is relevant beyond speculation. Disclosure is not to satisfy curiosity; it is not about what might be of some use or desirable. The test is reasonable necessity. Nothing less. By not applying that required stricture, I find that the Judge has fallen into error in an appellate sense and the court has the required basis to disturb the order. Further, there is no evidence to begin to suggest that the terms include material about directing activities to the UK. Information asymmetry is not the test, although a relevant factor. What is essential is some identifiable evidential foundation to indicate or reasonably infer that the disclosed material is relevant to the disputed issue. Instead, there is no evidence to suggest that the terms and conditions speak to the directed activities question at all. The appeal is allowed under this head.</p>

A knowledgeable source based in Lebanon has stated that employees of the Defendant undertook business trips to the UK in order to deal with high-net-worth clients of the Defendant resident in the UK. Specifically, that the Defendant asked carefully selected employees to arrange this travel privately and to cover their own expenses for the trips using personal accounts, and then reimbursed the employees in cash. I understand that at least three such trips occurred between 2012 and 2016, with further trips thereafter. The aim of these trips was to meet with high-net-worth clients and target new clients, and included discussing real estate investments in London. On at least one trip to London, employees of the Defendant also held meetings with Crossbridge Capital. The source said that they believed that the Defendant deliberately restricted knowledge of this activity to a very small number of people. Of course, the Claimant is not at this stage aware of the full details of such activities.&#8221;</p>

I have been informed that those who have previously been found to have provided such information have been the subject of reprisals.

Again these are assertions that would be tested by disclosure. But they are also inherently implausible. The idea that the Bank entered into a partnership in London and did not then either pursue or direct activities in the UK is nonsensical. That the Bank suggests that this would be the case only shows the lack of inherent credibility to its account and reiterates the need for disclosure. Moreover, more fundamentally, the Bank&#8217;s position is wrong as a matter of law: the Bank would still be pursuing activities in England even if it operated in London but targeted customers outside of the UK (this, again, being a matter for the substantive Jurisdiction Application).</p>

Whether what is consequently revealed is of the high degree of &#8220;conclusiveness&#8221; the Judge mentions, I cannot accurately predict. But I do not need to. The <span style="font-style:italic">Rome</span> stage 2 disclosure test is different (reasonable necessity) and it is here plainly met. On route (i), I note that it is submitted in the respondent&#8217;s skeleton argument at paras 14-15:</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.56in">I can entirely see how the Judge concluded that there should in principle be Crossbridge disclosure. It seems to me that there is certainly sufficient evidence on the pursuing basis to order disclosure, although I recognise that the Judge did not spell this out or not sufficiently in <span style="font-style:italic">Piglowska</span> terms. In any event, and on the hypothetical that the order had to be reversed, I would reach the conclusion that there is sufficient evidence for Crossbridge disclosure on the pursuing basis. There is no doubt, to my mind, that there is evidence suggestive of  Crossbridge pursuing commercial or professional activities in the UK (or for the section 15E test, &#8220;in the part of the United Kingdom in which the consumer [claimant] is domiciled&#8221;). The next question is whether there is enough to suggest that through its investment in Crossbridge in 2015 (19 per cent share capital) and 2016 (9.89 per cent), the appellant bank was also engaged in this relevant activity. I note that the mechanism was via the Bank&#8217;s subsidiary and Crossbridge&#8217;s holding company. This is not the place to adjudicate definitively on such questions. This is a disclosure appeal. However, I am persuaded that there is enough before me, when viewed as a whole, not to disturb the Judge&#8217;s overall conclusion that there should be in principle Crossbridge disclosure due to the &#8220;strategic investor&#8221; role of the appellant bank and the stated intention to establish a &#8220;partnership&#8221; and a &#8220;footprint&#8221; in the UK which would &#8220;support the Private Bank development strategy&#8221;. One must be careful not to artificially view the evidence in silos. There is a clear and reasonable inference at this point of a close tie between the appellant, or relevant corporate emanations of it, and Crossbridge. It is not clear &#8211; and it is unlikely to be at this interlocutory stage before standard disclosure &#8211;what the extent of the &#8220;partnership&#8221; between the appellant and Crossbridge was and the extent to which it involved the appellant in relevant commercial or professional activities in the UK through its planned &#8220;footprint&#8221;. While acknowledging that the Annual Report speaks of expansion in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, a significant word in the sentence is &#8220;and&#8221;. The relevant extract from the joint statement of Bank Audi&#8217;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer repays quoting in full:</p>

It is interesting to note that the wealth management platform it was intended that the Crossbridge partnership would establish would be a &#8220;centralised&#8221; function. This immediately raises the question of centralised to what. Here one can reasonably infer Crossbridge being used to supplement the appellant&#8217;s Private Banking offering by providing wealth management services centrally to the Bank&#8217;s clients, wherever they may be. This makes sense alongside establishing the Private Bank&#8217;s London footprint as part of the &#8220;Private Banking development strategy.&#8221; At this point, of the parties only the appellant knows what happened. But once more, eschewing fragmented evidential analysis, one can reasonably read across from the evidence about the London Desk being used to service the group&#8217;s UK-based customers and see how it lends plausible support to the likely existence of relevant evidence in the Crossbridge disclosure. The point of disclosure is to enable the court to deal with this issue justly. It is here that the information asymmetry that the Judge mentioned has relevance. The entity that knows the definitive truth about these questions is the appellant. I step back and view the evidence base before the Judge as a whole. It amply justifies her conclusion on Crossbridge on the principle of disclosure and I cannot disturb it. </p>

I next consider the reasonableness of the scope of the disclosure granted. I do not consider the six-year timeframe to be excessive given the indications in the Annual Reports beginning in 2015. That said, in material respects, the extent of the Crossbridge disclosure granted by the Judge is in my judgment unreasonably wide, and sufficiently so to justify this court interfering with that part of the order that exceeds the generous ambit recognised by authority. In 1g (i)-(v) of the McCloud Order, a potentially extensive number of documents are ordered to be disclosed. It is essential to keep the disclosure within proportionate and manageable bounds.

This is clear from the documentation which the Bank has already provided to the Claimant related to the opening of his own account: nothing in those documents reveals how the account first came to be opened with Banque Saradar S.A.L. in 1994 whilst the Claimant resided in Saudi Arabia.&#8221;</p>

No criticism is made of counsel; the weakness of the suggestion is a function of the nature of the document.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in;margin-right:0.56in">Therefore, the Judge was minded to order disclosure of any documents about the London Desk&#8217;s creation, irrespective of whether they contained evidence about the Bank directing banking activities to the United Kingdom or pursing relevant commercial or professional activities. I cannot think the order as made by the Judge is proportionate. However, any document that contains material evidence that the Bank was directing activities to the United Kingdom or intended to do so through the London Desk seems to me disclosable. I remind myself that evidence is placed before the court from former employees in respect of a subsidiary. As the Judge notes at footnote 2 at para 46, &#8220;The London Desk was also mentioned in the Bank&#8217;s website and reflected in a business card in evidence.&#8221; The putative date range in the Judgment is September 2000 (coinciding with the trademark proceedings that mentioned the London Desk) and December 2020, the last of the three relevant dates proposed by the respondent.  If the London Desk ceased to operate before 2020, then that would be naturally self-limiting &#8211; one cannot disclose what does not exist. Therefore, while in part the order under this head must be reversed, it appears to me that there is a valid basis to conclude that the reasonable necessity test in <span style="font-style:italic">Rome</span> is met. Having reversed the disproportionate part of the London Desk order, I judge, with closer focus, that the proper terms should be:</p>

In those cases, the court has not substituted its view, whether or not it would have exercised a discretion within the permitted range in the same way as the Judge, about which I say nothing.</p>

I can agree with her that informational asymmetry is a relevant factor, but the quest for a perfectly mirroring evidential equality should not obscure the need for proper restraint, parsimony and proportionality in disclosure. It is likely that the departure from proportionate disclosure stems from the breadth of information sought by the claimant.  It was put by Mr Shear of his solicitors (B1474) in this way:</p>

To restate: at the next turn lies a jurisdiction challenge hearing, not a &#8220;mini-trial&#8221; (in <span style="font-style:italic">VTB Capital </span>terms), let alone a full one (if happens at all, about which I also refrain from commenting on). That hearing will be determined using a modestly low threshold, as the Judge recognised. But words are insufficient. The acid test is the disclosure she ordered. I judge that she failed at times to give sufficient weight to the legally confined nature of the issue that had to be decided. The &#8220;equal footing&#8221; factor in the overriding objective is not unqualified. It is vitally tempered by the words &#8220;as far as is practicable&#8221;. It must be given effect to in the context of the need to deal with the matter at &#8220;proportionate cost&#8221; and in light of the &#8220;complexity of the issues&#8221; (CPR Part 1).  I am bound to say that from everything I have seen, the gateway jurisdiction question is unlikely to be complex. It is important not to overcomplicate it. </p>

While the defendant bank challenges jurisdiction as is its right, it is in no one&#8217;s interests to be mired in protracted Byzantine interlocutory skirmishes. I remind myself of the salutary words of Lord Neuberger in <span style="font-style:italic">VTB Capital</span> that it is &#8220;simply disproportionate&#8221; for parties to incur costs &#8220;running to hundreds of thousands of pounds each, and to spend many days in court, on such a hearing.&#8221;  This was the Supreme Court&#8217;s cautionary statement about the substantive jurisdiction hearing. The deprecated level of costs has now been reached on just the disclosure proceedings ancillary to such a hearing. It is of note that the Judge ordered a &#8220;disclosure statement&#8221;. The parties were unable to find a single decided case where the court had ordered a disclosure statement in such circumstances. As the appellant submits, it indicates that &#8220;something has gone wrong&#8221;. In similar vein, the Judge spoke of costs budgets for the process, once more a step that appears unprecedented. These innovations are suggestive of a loss of tight control on what should be a circumspect and controlled process.  Lord Neuberger&#8217;s speech in <span style="font-style:italic">VTB Capital</span> was cited by Lord Briggs in <span style="font-style:italic">Vedanta</span> (para 7).

The disclosure mandated will be manageable administratively and proportionate in extent; it can comfortably be considered within the strict (and already generous) perimeters of the time allocated to the substantive jurisdiction hearing listed in April. I sense-check my decisions with a return to <span style="font-style:italic">Rome</span> (and <span style="font-style:italic">Vedanta</span>): ordering such disclosure, I remain acutely aware, is out of the norm for a jurisdiction challenge and &#8220;exceptional&#8221; &#8211; a description, not the test. I am satisfied that the disclosure orders, as refined, will permit the court to determine the jurisdiction question proportionately as envisaged by Lord Neuberger and Lord Briggs, not hamstring or prejudice the claimant/respondent in meeting the Bank&#8217;s forum challenge, and in this way enable the court to deal with the case justly and &#8220;in particular&#8221; (PD 31A) give effect to the overriding objective in doing so.</p>
