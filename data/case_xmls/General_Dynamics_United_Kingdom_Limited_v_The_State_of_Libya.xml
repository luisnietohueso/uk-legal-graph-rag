	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By a written agreement dated 5 May 2008 the respondent (&#8220;GDUK&#8221;) agreed to supply a Tactical Communications and Information System to the appellant (&#8220;Libya&#8221;) for the price of &#163;84m (&#8220;the Contract&#8221;). The Contract was governed by the law of Switzerland. Clause 32 provided for arbitration of any dispute under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (&#8220;the ICC&#8221;), further providing that the decision of the arbitration panel &#8220;shall be final, binding and wholly enforceable&#8221;. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is common ground that clause 32 constituted a written agreement by Libya to submit disputes under the Contract to arbitration within the meaning of section 9 of the State Immunity Act 1978 (&#8220;the SIA&#8221;), so that Libya is not immune as to the adjudicative jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom in relation to that arbitration. The issue on this appeal is whether Libya thereby also consented, within the meaning of section 13(3) of the SIA, to the execution against its property of any ICC arbitration award made against it.  </p>

The Award had been published on 5 January 2016 and was recognised in this jurisdiction under section 101 of the Arbitration Act 1996, with leave to enforce the Award as though it was a judgment of the court, by order of Teare J dated 18 July 2018.</p>

		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.59in">&#8220;The SIA is a complete code and now the sole source of the English law of state immunity. The scheme of the SIA is to create a general immunity conferred by <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">SIA, s.1(1)</span> for the governmental acts of states, subject to the express exceptions set out in later sections of the SIA &#8211; see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Benkharbouche v Embassy of the Republic of Sudan</span> [2019] AC 777, per Lord Sumption at paragraph 39. The SIA draws a clear distinction between a court&#8217;s adjudicative jurisdiction (which is the subject of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">SIA, ss.2-11</span>) and its enforcement jurisdiction (which is the subject of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">SIA, ss.13(2)-(6)</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">14(3)-(4)</span>) &#8211; see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Alcom Ltd. V. Republic of Colombia</span> [1984] AC 580 per Lord Diplock at 600F-H, where the point is also made that voluntary submission to the court&#8217;s adjudicative jurisdiction does not of itself imply any submission to its enforcement jurisdiction; and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">General Dynamics United Kingdom Ltd v State of Libya</span> [2021] UKSC 22; [2022] AC 318 per Lord Lloyd-Jones at paragraph 30. This distinction means, in relation to arbitral awards, that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">SIA s.9</span> applies to applications under [Arbitration Act 1996] <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">s.101(2)</span> because &#8220; <span style="font-style:italic">&#8230; leave to enforce an award as a judgment is, as subsection (1) recognises, one aspect of its recognition and as such is the final stage in rendering the arbitral procedure effective. Enforcement by execution on property belonging to the state is another matter, as section 13 makes clear</span>&#8221; &#8211; see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Svenska Petroleum Exploration v Lithuania</span> [2007] QB 886 per Moore-Bick LJ at [117].&#8221;</p>

Using the word &#8220;wholly&#8221; is obviously inapposite if the intention was to confine the meaning of enforceable in the way contended for by [Libya]. Indeed, in my view to attempt to construe the clause in the manner adopted by [Libya] is likely to defeat what is required by a good faith approach to the true meaning and effect of the agreement when the alternative &#8211; that the sentence is concerned with waiving adjudicative immunity alone &#8211; makes little sense given (a) what the third sentence of clause 32 appears to achieve and (b) that in any event an Award made by a tribunal sitting in Switzerland applying Swiss law would be and it is reasonably to be inferred would be known to the parties and their advisors to be adjudicatively enforceable in most states by reference to the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (&#8220;New York Convention&#8221;).&#8221;</p>

As GDUK points out, however, the Judge there held that there was no requirement for &#8220;special or particular words&#8221; to satisfy section 13(3); he did not consider, because it was not argued, whether &#8220;clear words&#8221; were required.

It derives from the principle of sovereign equality of States, which, as article 2, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations makes clear, is one of the fundamental principles of the international legal order. This principle has to be viewed together with the principle that each State possesses sovereignty over its own territory and that there flows from that sovereignty the jurisdiction of the State over events and persons within that territory. Exceptions to the immunity of the State represent a departure from the principle of sovereign equality. Immunity may represent a departure from the principle of territorial sovereignty and the jurisdiction which flows from it.&#8221; (at para 57) </p>

The sub-section requires the written consent of the state concerned, such consent being &#8220;expressed so as to apply to a limited extent or generally&#8221; by the words used. The task of the court is therefore to determine whether and to what extent the state gave (that is, expressed) its consent by construing the words used according to the law applicable to that exercise, in the present case, Swiss law. Once the court has determined that the state&#8217;s consent for the giving of the relief in question was expressed by the written words, section 13(3) is satisfied. As it is common ground that there is no need to use the word &#8220;consent&#8221; or any other specific wording, it is unclear what would be required, beyond that the words used express consent, for that consent to be regarded as &#8220;express&#8221;. Further, given that words will not be construed as giving consent if they express an intention which is unclear or equivocal, there appears to be no scope for an additional requirement for &#8220;clear words&#8221;.</p>

Part of the difficulty is a lack of clarity in legal discourse generally about what is meant by "express" meaning. Properly understood, express meaning can include implications, which constitute the unexpressed content of a statement or term and which are identified by inference.</p>

The meaning of an express term is derived primarily from the content of the words expressed. It contrasts with an implied term, the meaning of which is derived primarily by inference from the conduct of the parties to the agreement and the circumstances in light of the express terms. There can sometimes be difficulty in distinguishing between the two types of terms, because often the imprecision of language means that inferences are required to understand an express term. Even the words of the most carefully drafted international instrument are built upon a foundation of presuppositions and necessary implicatures and explicatures. The international authorities that insist upon express waiver of immunity in a treaty should not be understood as denying the ordinary and natural role of implications in elucidating the meaning of the express words of the treaty.</p>

For instance, Lord Goff's statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Pinochet [No 3]</span> that consent must be "express" was based on his acceptance of the submissions of Dr Collins, including that "[a] term can only be [recognised as] implied [in] a treaty for necessity, not to give the treaty maximum effect"&#8230; </p>

		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:0.02in">In this sense, the insistence by international authority that a waiver of immunity in an international agreement must be "express" is an insistence that any inference of a waiver of immunity must be drawn with great care when interpreting the express words of that agreement in context. It does not deny that implications are almost invariably contained in any (expressed) words of a treaty. As senior counsel for Spain rightly put the point in oral submissions: "[T]here must be implications that surround every textual passage. The question is: what are those implications, and what level of clarity about the implication is required?" Accordingly, if an international agreement does not expressly use the word "waiver", the inference that an express term involves a waiver of immunity will only be drawn if the implication is clear from the words used and the context. In words quoted by Lord Goff in <span style="font-style:italic">Pinochet [No 3]</span> from the International Law Commission's commentary upon (what were then) the draft articles on jurisdictional immunities of States and their property, there is "no room" to recognise an implication of "consent of an unwilling state which has not expressed its consent in a clear and recognisable manner". And as Rehnquist CJ said, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court of the <span style="font-style:italic">United States in Argentine Republic v Amerada Hess Shipping Corp</span>, a foreign State will not waive its immunity merely "by signing an international agreement that contains no mention of a waiver of immunity to suit in United States courts or even the availability of a cause of action in the United States". This reflects the "political principle that those who are independent and autonomous cannot, except by consent, exercise authority over, or establish an external source of authority over, others of independent and autonomous status".&#8221;</p>

The immediate answer is that that is a criticism of the Judge&#8217;s approach to construction of the Contract rather than his interpretation of section 13(3) of the SIA.

It is well established that a state can submit to the jurisdiction of another state to determine issues of liability and enter judgment (including recognising an arbitration award and giving it the status of a judgment), but without consenting to execution of such judgment or award against the state&#8217;s property: that is precisely the effect of article 54 and 55 of the ICSID Convention (as interpreted in <span style="font-style:italic">Infrastructure</span>), given effect in this jurisdiction by the Arbitration (International Investments Disputes) Act 1966, recognising that the Contracting States are willing to submit to the jurisdiction of other Contracting States, but not to execution against their property.  This reflects the &#8220;greater sensitivities&#8221; surrounding execution against a state&#8217;s property, as recognised by Lord Lloyd-Jones in the Supreme Court in these proceedings. The distinction was also emphasised in <span style="font-style:italic">Svenska Petroleum Exploration v Lithuania </span>[2007] QB 886, [2006] EWCA Civ 1529, where the court (Sir Anthony Clarke MR, Scott Baker and Moore-Bick LJJ) stated at [117] as follows:</p>

In our view an application under section 101(2) of the Arbitration Act 1996 for leave to enforce an award as a judgment is, as subsection (1) recognises, one aspect of its recognition and as such is the final state in rendering the arbitral procedure effective.

Libya emphasises that standard form (or &#8220;boilerplate&#8221;) waivers of state immunity, catering for both adjudicative and execution waiver, are far more extensive and deal separately and expressly with each form of immunity and its waiver, making reference to assets and/or property in relation to the waiver of execution immunity. Further, there is no example in the cases of a single reference to enforceability being construed as waiving both forms of immunity: as set out at [13] above, the term construed commercially as a waiver of execution immunity in <span style="font-style:italic">A Co.

The Judge rejected Libya&#8217;s contention that &#8220;wholly enforceable&#8221; was a waiver of adjudicative immunity, holding that that was achieved by the words &#8220;final and binding upon the parties&#8221; in the third sentence of clause 32 and also by virtue of section 9 of the SIA, the parties having agreed to submit their disputes to arbitration. The Judge concluded that the phrase &#8220;wholly enforceable&#8221; must apply to something else, which justified his conclusion that it was a waiver of execution immunity. I do not agree with that analysis for the following reasons:</p>

The only alternative meaning suggested for those words is that Libya consented to the whole of the award being recognised. Where, as that argument implies, the parties must be taken to appreciate the distinction between recognition of an award and its enforcement, the fact that they have not separately addressed those two concepts, but have instead referred simply to the award being &#8220;wholly&#8221; enforceable, suggests to me the plain conclusion that they consented to the whole process of enforcement of the award, including its recognition in any jurisdiction where it is sought to be enforced. The fact that, as Phillips LJ points out, the parties have agreed (by agreeing that disputes will be settled under the ICC Arbitration Rules) to carry out any award without delay, serves to reinforce that conclusion.</span></p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The State Immunity Act 1978, whose long title states as its first purpose to make new provision with respect to proceedings in the United Kingdom by or against other states, purports in Part I to deal comprehensively with the jurisdiction of courts of law in the United Kingdom both (1) to adjudicate upon claims against foreign states (&#8220;adjudicative jurisdiction&#8221;); and (2) to enforce by legal process (&#8220;enforcement jurisdiction&#8221;) judgments pronounced and orders made in the exercise of their adjudicative jurisdiction. But, although comprehensive, the Act in its approach to these two aspects of the jurisdiction exercised by courts of law does not adopt the straightforward dichotomy between <span style="font-style:italic">acta jure imperii</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">acta jure gestionis</span> that had become familiar doctrine in public international law, except that it comes close to doing so in section 14(2) in relation to the immunity conferred upon &#8220;separate entities that are emanations of the state&#8221;. Instead, as respects foreign states themselves the Act starts by restating in statutory form in section 1(1) the general principle of absolute sovereign immunity, but makes the principle subject to wide-ranging exceptions for which the subsequent sections in Part I of the Act (sections 2 to 17) provide.&#8221;</p>

Part I is entitled &#8220;Proceedings in United Kingdom by or against other states&#8221;. Section 1(1) confers on a state a general immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom except as provided in the following provisions of Part I. That immunity extends to both the adjudicative and enforcement jurisdiction of the courts. Sections 2 to 11 set out exceptions to the immunity from adjudicative jurisdiction, including in section 9 an exception in the case of certain proceedings which relate to arbitrations. Sections 13(2) to (6) and 14(3) and (4) address and establish exceptions to the immunity from enforcement jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>

I accept that the consent must be express consent. But if, properly interpreted in accordance with its governing law, a written contract does give consent, then in my judgment the sub-section is satisfied. The contract, as properly interpreted, will amount to an express consent. Mr Lissack KC submitted that &#8220;clear words&#8221; are necessary before a state can be said to have given consent. That submission was based on principles applicable to the interpretation of contracts under English law. There is no evidence that a similar principle applies in Swiss law. Section 13(3) does not impose any higher standard.  One consequence of Mr Lissack&#8217;s submission (as he acknowledged) was that a contract which, according to Swiss law, amounted to an express consent, might not amount to written consent for the purpose of section 13(3). That would, in my view, be an incoherent result. I reject that submission. </p>

That result is achieved by the mere fact of submission of the dispute to arbitration. For good measure, however, clause 32 goes on to provide that &#8220;the award will be final and binding upon the parties&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I find it very difficult to understand what else that sentence could mean. Before the judge, Libya contended that&#160;the final sentence of clause 32 meant simply that any award is wholly enforceable to the extent permitted by the law of the jurisdiction in which it is being enforced and thus in England enforcement was subject to the immunity from enforcement set out in&#160;section 13(2)(b).&#160;That argument overlooked the fact that English law permits enforcement of a judgment against a state if the state has consented in writing. I also agree with the judge that the first part of clause 32, by which the parties agreed that the award would be final and binding itself achieves the result for which Libya contended.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before us, Mr Lissack suggested a different interpretation. He submitted that what the clause meant was that the whole of the award (as opposed to part of it) would be recognised as such by courts and tribunals around the world as <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> between the parties. It did not permit GDUK to take steps in execution against specific assets. This suffers from the same defect as the interpretation advanced before the judge. The result for which Libya contends is already achieved by the parties&#8217; agreement that &#8220;the award will be final and binding upon the parties&#8221;. That can only mean the whole award as opposed to only part of it. In addition, as Mr Smouha KC pointed out, the effect of the suggested interpretation is that the final sentence of clause 32 achieves nothing at all. The idea that the parties wished to guard against the possibility that only part of the award might be recognised as <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> is, in my view, entirely fanciful.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition, the award is a New York Convention award. Article III of the Convention provides that each contracting state must &#8220;recognize arbitration awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied on&#8221;. Accordingly, recognition of the award was already achieved without the need of the final sentence of clause 32. The distinction between recognition and enforcement is also reflected in section 101 of the Arbitration Act 1996.</p>
