	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Religion or Belief Discrimination: section 136 Equality Act 2010</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">The Claimant was selected for redundancy in phase 2 of a programme of redundancies. He was scored against an agreed matrix but did not achieve a sufficient number of points to reach the threshold applied by the respondent. He was dismissed. The Tribunal found the dismissal procedurally and substantively fair. </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">The Claimant maintained his selection for redundancy amounted to direct discrimination because of his Islamic faith. The Tribunal dismissed that complaint.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">On appeal, the Claimant argued the Tribunal had failed to apply the burden of proof provisions contained in section 136 </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302">Equality Act 2010</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#010302"> and had failed to consider whether numerical evidence about the selection exercise was sufficient to shift the burden to the Respondent.</span></p>

It also dismissed the claimant&#8217;s related claim of direct religion or belief discrimination. The claimant had also brought a claim for holiday pay. In respect of that, an agreement was reached during the hearing below that the sum of &#163;325.35 should be paid and it was ultimately marked as withdrawn, and then dismissed upon receipt of that payment.</span></p>

It failed to persuade Judge Keith on the sift that it disclosed reasonable grounds for bringing the appeal.  At a rule 3(10) hearing the claimant sensibly utilised the services of Mr&#160;Kohanzad of counsel under the auspices of the ELAAS scheme.  Mr Kohanzad refocused the appeal and persuaded John Bowers KC, Deputy High Court Judge, that a single ground concerning the tribunal&#8217;s approach to the burden of proof provisions was arguable.  The judge permitted that single ground to proceed to today&#8217;s hearing. He dismissed the other grounds, including one put forward relating to redundancy scoring matrices.  </span></p>

He was employed at the Dunstable depot (also referred to as the Dunstable branch).  The respondent&#8217;s business was hard hit by the Covid pandemic resulting in a dramatic downturn in demand for its services.  This was because many customers moved to cashless transactions. The respondent was obliged to cut its national workforce by 48% and in 2020 embarked on a process of phased redundancies.</span></p>

Selection occurred using criteria which had been agreed with the two recognised unions following consultation. The claimant was not selected during phase 1. His case before the tribunal was that the respondent had used phase 1 as an occasion to select seemingly problematic employees.  </span></p>

Mr Kohanzad told me that the claimant had not submitted that only six people were made redundant from the Dunstable depot in phase 1 and that five of those six, ie 83%, were Muslim.  The claimant&#8217;s position had been that he did not know how many from the Dunstable depot had been made redundant in phase 1, but that within the &#8216;vault section&#8217; of the Dunstable depot, five out of six of those selected were Muslim.  </span></p>

Those provisions are important in circumstances where there is room for doubt as to the facts necessary to establish discrimination - generally, that is, facts about the respondent&#8217;s motivation (in the sense defined above) because of the notorious difficulty of knowing what goes on inside someone else&#8217;s head &#8211; &#8220;the devil himself knoweth not the mind of man&#8221; (per Brian CJ, YB Pas 17 Edw IV f1, pl 2). But they have no bearing where the tribunal is in a position to make positive findings on the evidence one way or the other, and still less where there is no real dispute about the respondent&#8217;s motivation and what is in issue is its correct characterisation in law. In the present case, once the tribunal had found that the reasons given by Mr Hudson and Mr Buckland in their letters reflected their genuine motivation, the issue was indeed how that was to be characterised and the burden of proof did not come into the equation.

If at the end of the hearing, having considered all of the evidence, the tribunal concludes that there is nothing that could suggest that discrimination has occurred and the employer has established a non-discriminatory reason for the impugned treatment, there would be no error of law in just answering the &#8220;reason why&#8221; question, but it is hard to see what would be gained by doing so, when the tribunal has already concluded that there is no evidence that could establish discrimination, which would result in the claim failing at the first stage . There is much to be said for making that finding and then going on to say that, in addition, the respondent&#8217;s non-discriminatory reason for the treatment was accepted. </span></p>

But again it is hard to see what the advantage is. Where there is evidence that could indicate discrimination there is much to be said for properly grappling with the evidence and deciding whether it is, or is not, sufficient to switch the burden of proof. That will avoid a claimant feeling that the evidence has been swept under the carpet. It is hard to see the disadvantage of stating that there was evidence that was sufficient to shift the burden of proof but that, despite the burden having been shifted, a non-discriminatory reason for the treatment has been made out.</span></p>

This could involve treating the two stages as if hermetically sealed from each other, whereas evidence is not generally like that. It also runs the risk that a claimant will feel that their claim that they have been subject to unlawful discrimination has not received the attention that it merits.&#8221;</span></p>

Statistical techniques are often concerned with associations rather than causation. Further, care must be taken to consider what can be drawn from any data or statistics contained in the evidence, particularly where the numbers involved, such as the numbers selected for redundancy or in pools for selection, are small, and where little is known about the statistical significance of the numbers produced. Finally where statistical tests are employed, the assumptions on which they rest must be carefully scrutinised.</span></p>

No reliance was placed on the reference to length of service issues identified in paragraph 16. As I have mentioned, it transpired during this appeal hearing that this was not a proper reflection of the numbers in question. In fact 28 individuals had been made redundant in phase 1 from the depot and the figure of five out of six related to a subgroup of the 28, namely those who worked in the vault section. Thus, the evidential picture was that five of the 28 people selected for redundancy at phase 1 were known by the claimant to be Muslim.  That equates to around 18%.</span></p>

I agree with that concession.  It does not amount to any evidence at all that the reason for the claimant&#8217;s selection was his faith. Mr&#160;Kohanzad, however, relied on it in conjunction with the evidence in relation to phase 1.  However, I do not consider that it adds anything even when taken in conjunction with those other numbers. It simply is not evidence linking the claimant&#8217;s faith to the reason for his selection.</span></p>

All the numbers showed was that 18% of those selected in phase 1 were Muslim.  There was no data concerning the religious makeup of the pool from which the 28 were selected so that this could be compared and the statistical significance of any difference assessed in light of the sample size of 28.  The reason for that was the subject of a finding by the tribunal.  The tribunal found that the respondent did not collect data concerning the faith of its employees and thus it did not know (see paragraph 35 of the judgment).  There was no suggestion that information had not been properly disclosed in this case.</span></p>

I am entirely satisfied that the numbers were not presented to the tribunal below in the way that I have described.  The submission being made to the tribunal was that phase 1 was used as a way to select problematic employees and that, of different groups of problematic employees, those of Islamic faith were problematic because they used work facilities for prayer. The reference to five Muslim employees in the vault department being selected was used to exemplify this submission.  The tribunal rejected it. Using language echoing section 136 of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">Equality Act 2010,</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> at paragraph 17 the tribunal held that there was no evidence from which it could conclude that the use of work facilities for prayer was considered problematic.</span></p>
