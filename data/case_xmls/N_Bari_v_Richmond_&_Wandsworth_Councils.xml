	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The respondents operate a shared staffing arrangement. The claimant is jointly employed by them as a duty manager at the Hampton Sports and Fitness Centre.  Pursuant to two claim forms, he brings multiple complaints under the <span style="font-weight:bold">Equality Act 2010</span>, relying on the protected characteristic of disability.  He is a litigant in person.  He seeks to appeal from a decision refusing an application by him for a case-management order. That decision was communicated, first, by a letter of 23 October 2023 and then again by a letter of 10 November 2023.  It appears that it was reissued, because its first version did not identify the judge who had made that decision, being EJ Wright.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As well as appealing, the claimant applied for what he called a reconsideration. That was not strictly the appropriate terminology, as this was a case-management decision and not a judgment.  But in any event a letter of 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>January 2024 sent at the direction of EJ Wright stated that the claimant&#8217;s application had been considered afresh and was refused.  He thereupon sought what he again described as a reconsideration and that too was refused by EJ Wright in a further letter of 2 February 2024.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This is not an appeal against either of the reconsideration decisions.  But both counsel agreed, rightly, that the outcome ultimately turns on the first reconsideration decision, in which the tribunal gave what amounted to its final reasons for refusing the claimant&#8217;s application.  The final decision simply declined to revisit the matter again.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The judge who considered the appeal on paper considered it arguable that the tribunal erred because it misdirected itself and failed to apply the correct legal test when deciding the claimant&#8217;s application.  In her skeleton, Miss Darlow Stearn who appears for the claimant, breaks that down into two grounds, while recognising they are closely linked, being, first, misdirection as to the correct legal test and, secondly, failure to apply the correct legal test.  She also applies to add a third ground, being that the decision was not <span style="font-style:italic">Meek</span>-compliant.  Mr Crawford, for the respondents, opposed that application but also responded to that additional ground on its merits.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I will address the application to amend first.  The principles that guide the EAT are well-established.  They are set out in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Khudados v Leggate</span> [2005] ICR 1013 and further discussed in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Readman v Devon Primary Care Trust</span>, UKEAT/0016/11.  Miss Darlow Stearn notes that until she was instructed through the Free Representation Unit (FRU) in February 2025 the claimant had been a litigant in person.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Meek</span>-compliance ground is closely intertwined with the existing grounds.  She also says that there is no prejudice to the respondents by this ground being added, as they can respond to it and, indeed, have done so; and it will not take up significant extra time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Crawford noted that the application had not been made using the EAT&#8217;s application form.  He also submitted that the materials before the EAT show that the claimant was and is capable of marshalling and advancing articulate legal arguments.  </p>

	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I will permit this amendment, for the following reasons.  Firstly, whilst the claimant has been able to put forward articulate arguments that make references to legal rules and principles, nevertheless, whatever assistance he may have had, he has hitherto been acting as a litigant in person; and as result of FRU being involved, this is the first time that he is represented in these proceedings by a lawyer.  </p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Secondly, this new ground closely overlaps with the existing ground or grounds, as a significant part of it asserts that the tribunal has not shown that it has applied the correct legal test, because of the paucity of its reasoning.  Thirdly, whilst this application was first raised only in the run-up to this hearing, Mr Crawford has been able to marshal his arguments.  There was no suggestion by him that, because of the late stage at which this ground was raised, the respondents have been prejudiced in their ability to respond to it.  Finally, whilst the application ought to have been made using the EAT&#8217;s application form, the substance of the ground, and the arguments in support of it, are all to be found in Miss Darlow Stearn&#8217;s skeleton argument.</p>

The judge directed both claims to be heard together at a full hearing listed for six days in May 2023, and gave directions for preparations for that hearing.  The hearing record noted that the claimant was employed on a casual contract from May 2017, but had been made a permanent member of staff from 10 February 2020.  It set out what it called a final list of issues.  That identified the complaints as being of direct discrimination, failure to make reasonable adjustments, harassment and victimisation.  The respondents accepted that the claimant is disabled by reason of psoriatic arthritis.  </p>

Whilst these authorities break down the test in to three elements, these are not necessarily rigid or compartmentalised sub-tests, and in the given case these different sub-strands may overlap or interact.  Relevance is, however, the logical place to start, because, if the tribunal concludes that the request is for disclosure of material that simply is not relevant to any issue in the case, then the application will be refused.  </p>

The definition of a document in the CPR is anything which <span style="font-style:italic">contains</span> information.  So that may include not just hard copy documents, but electronically-stored documents or electronic communications.  Nevertheless a specific request for a document or documents must relate to a particular document or category of documents which is known or believed already to exist.  If what is sought is purely information, as such, rather than existing documents, so that the information would have to be compiled or collated in to a new document in order to be provided, that is a request for information and not for documents.  </p>

But in view of <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Carrington</span>, and to lay the point to rest, I note the following.  Firstly, a number of more recent authorities proceed on the basis that there is such a power.  <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Essex County Council v Jarrett</span> [2015] UKEAT/0087/15 did so, and also held that the guidance in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Beck</span> applies to such requests.  <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Element</span> also did so, at [29] &#8211; [36], holding that the touchstone test is to be found in CPR 18, and that the principles to be applied are similar to those which apply to disclosure requests.  </p>

Those set out exhaustive case management powers which did not include the power to order answers to questions or provision of information.  But all subsequent iterations of the Rules of Procedure up until the 2013 Rules included such a power in one form or another.  The 2013 Rules adopted instead the generic case management power in Rule 29.  Further, Rule 31 refers to provision of both documents and information; and although, as <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Sarnoff</span> holds, that Rule relates to non-parties, it cannot possibly have been intended that the case-management power relating to orders against parties in Rule 29 should be narrower and not also extend to provision of information.</p>

Nor did the observations in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Sarnoff</span> at [23], that it is wrong to view the tribunal rules through the prism of the CPR, have that effect by a sidewind.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I conclude, having regard to all the authorities, that the general test and principles are broadly the same whether the application is for disclosure or for information.  However, when it comes to the application of the test to a request for information there may be real practical differences.  If what is being sought is not an existing document or documents, but pure information, the task involved in complying with the order, if made, may be practically very different.  For example, it might require considerable work to find and collate the information or to ascertain if it even exists.  It may require analysis or processing of raw information in order to answer the specific questions asked.  Even if some answers might turn out to be found within existing documents, the substantive nature of the exercise may involve significantly different work.  Of course, what would be involved in the given case is case-sensitive.</p>

As is discussed in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Element</span> at [32] &#8211; [36] fishing involves seeking information about a matter that does not yet form part of a pleaded case.  That includes seeking further information to assist a party to plead a case of which they know something, but not as much as they would like, as well as a party seeking to discover a case of which they know nothing.</p>

That said, in the context of a discrimination claim, the authorities recognise as a general proposition that aspects of the wider workplace landscape may sometimes be said to be relevant or probative.  In the context of discrimination claims, the old statutory questionnaire procedure formerly provided a formal means of seeking information.  However, it did not enable an order to be made compelling the recipient to reply, and only gave the tribunal the power to draw inferences from an unreasonably late, or incomplete, or evasive or equivocal reply.  A proportionate and more focused questionnaire was therefore generally more likely to yield results, whether from the recipient or from the tribunal.</p>

Miss Darlow Stearn nevertheless relied on observations in <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Virgin Atlantic Airways v Loverseed</span> [2024] IRLR 651 at [48] that a decision of this sort involves an exercise of evaluative judgment, so that the room for a range of opinion is narrower.  However, that case was concerned with an issue of specific redactions made to specific documents.  A due margin of appreciation must be allowed to an employment tribunal in respect, for example, of its evaluation of the degree of relevance of particular documents or information sought, and of issues of proportionality.  Nevertheless, it is also well-established that, even in relation to case-management decisions, the EAT can and must intervene if the tribunal has made a principled error, for example, by not correctly applying the appropriate law; or if its decision is not <span style="font-style:italic">Meek</span>-compliant.  </p>

Alternatively, the judge may have seen it, but considered that it was not reasonable, perhaps because it was too extensive.

However, in this case the tribunal did not, in the 10 January letter, state the guiding principles in the language of the authorities.  It did not refer to whether disclosure was necessary for fairly disposing of the proceedings, nor to the sub-elements of the test.  What it said was that it was not clear how the information requested would assist the tribunal.  In using that expression the judge, intentionally or not, was echoing a phrase used by the claimant himself in his application and correspondence, although at other points the claimant did use the language used in the authorities.  </p>

Mr Crawford submits that on a natural reading one can infer that what the tribunal meant was that the claimant had not shown that any of the information sought was relevant to any of the issues in the case.  That could be inferred from the tribunal&#8217;s further remarks about the claim for reasonable adjustments relating to the claimant&#8217;s particular situation and circumstances.  Mr Crawford also submits that the claimant had repeatedly <span style="font-style:italic">asserted</span> that the information sought was relevant, but did not explain why.

He noted also that the claimant had not engaged with the observations made by the tribunal at the postponed trial, about weaknesses or gaps in his case.  Further, what had apparently prompted the requests was the claimant having learned about one or two particular individuals who he now regarded as potential comparators. These requests, however, ranged far more widely, and included requests relating effectively to the entire work force.</p>

Collating the information would also pose logistical problems and significant work, if it was available at all.</p>

If it transpired that another disabled employee who had moved from a casual contract in leisure services to a permanent contract, had been granted an adjustment relating to their days or hours, that might cast light on the justification that had been put forward for saying that such an adjustment was not possible in the claimant&#8217;s own case.

The tribunal may perhaps have approached the application that way because the information sought was itself all about reasonable adjustments sought by, or made for, others.  But, reading the claimant&#8217;s application and emails, it is clear that he was arguing that this information was also relevant to his complaints of direct discrimination and victimisation.  That was because he contended that, if adjustments had been granted to a colleague in similar circumstances, then that would cast light on the genuineness of the explanation that had been given, for not granting an adjustment in his case.  That would in turn be relevant to whether it might be inferred that the decision was in fact influenced by his disability or protected acts.</p>

However, I think it is sufficiently clear from the claimant&#8217;s communications that the case he was seeking to make was that, if a disabled colleague in sufficiently similar circumstances, particular one in leisure services who had moved from casual to permanent employment, had been granted adjustments to their days or hours, then that might cast light on the justification put forward as to why the claimant&#8217;s request was refused.

Indeed, I am inclined to think that the natural reading of the 10 January 2024 email is that the tribunal considered that the point about the claimant&#8217;s claim for reasonable adjustments turning on his own particular circumstances amounted to a complete and decisive answer to his application, so that it was not necessary to consider any other arguments.  But, even if the tribunal did have in mind some or even all of the factors raised by the respondents in correspondence, it simply did not say so, and the decision was in that respect not <span style="font-style:italic">Meek</span>-compliant.</p>

As I have indicated, it may also be that the judge considered that in any event the claimant&#8217;s requests formulated in the eight questions were far too wide-ranging to be reasonable.  But although formulated as eight questions, they effectively fell into three groups.  Questions 1 to 4 were about those who had moved from casual to permanent employment in the Sports Centres since November 2019.  They were ultimately seeking to know how many such individuals were disabled and granted reasonable adjustments in relation to their hours and days of work, and by which line manager.</p>
