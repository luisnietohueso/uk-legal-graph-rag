	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">COSTS</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">During the pandemic, following the loss of the client contract to which he was assigned, the claimant in the employment tribunal was not furloughed and was dismissed.  He brought a complaint of race discrimination, relying upon two colleagues (not of his race) who were furloughed at the time when he was dismissed, as statutory comparators.  The claim failed at trial.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The respondent then applied for costs.  In its first decision arising from the costs hearing the tribunal decided that the costs threshold was crossed.  That was in particular because, following exchange of witness statements, the claimant should have realised that his reliance on his colleagues as actual comparators, and his overall claim, had no reasonable prospect of success, but fought on to trial.  The tribunal erred, in particular having regard to features of the evidence that should have been regarded as giving the claimant a reasonable basis for continuing with his claim to a trial, at which the respondent&#8217;s witness evidence could be tested, either relying on the colleagues as actual statutory comparators, or relying upon a hypothetical comparator, and on the treatment of the colleagues as evidentially relevant.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The tribunal also erred in a further decision fixing the amount of costs, in particular by awarding costs summarily limited to the maximum amount sought, which was considerably lower than the amount said to have been incurred in the relevant period, but without addressing whether an award of that maximum amount was, in and of itself, reasonable and proportionate.  </span></p>

Following the onset of the pandemic, and then the loss of the client project on which the claimant was working, the respondent decided not to furlough him and to dismiss him on 1 April 2020.  He thereafter brought a claim complaining of direct race discrimination in respect of both decisions, acting as a litigant in person.  </span></p>

The respondent then applied for costs.  That was considered at a further hearing before the same panel in November 2022.  The tribunal decided that costs should in principle be awarded.  Following provision of further evidence as to the claimant&#8217;s means, the tribunal met in chambers and produced a further written decision ordering him to pay costs to the respondent in the sum of &#163;10,000.</span></p>

The notices of appeal prepared by the claimant himself, acting again as a litigant in person, were considered on paper not to raise any arguable grounds.  But arising from a combined rule 3(10) hearing at which the claimant was represented by Ms&#160;Ling of counsel under the ELAAS scheme, amended grounds were directed to proceed to a full appeal hearing.  The respondent&#8217;s solicitors thereafter emailed the EAT stating that the appeals were opposed and that it relied upon the employment tribunal&#8217;s reasons, but also stating that it would not be participating in the proceedings; and no representative has appeared for it today.  Ms&#160;Ling has once again appeared for the claimant, through the auspices of Advocate.</span></p>

He asked to be furloughed and indicated that he was willing to reduce his salary to the level of the &#163;2500 monthly grant available from the government under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS).  However, at that time the respondent&#8217;s policy was to pay furloughed employees 80% of actual salary, even if that exceeded the monthly grant, and the claimant&#8217;s offer was declined.  </span></p>

However, at the end of June the respondent agreed confidentially with P that his furlough pay would be limited to the CJRS amount of &#163;2500 for the final month of his contract, being July 2020.  In the event, no further project work from JLR came through and the employments of both P and S were terminated.  In the case of P, that was at the end of July 2020.  In the case of S, although the tribunal does not mention the date in its decision, it appears from the documents that that was at the end of September 2020.</span></p>

The tribunal relied on the fact that these showed him the evidence that the respondent would rely upon in support of its case that there were material differences between him and each of P and S as regards salary, role and experience, and/or performance issues.  The tribunal considered that he should have realised from that point, that his case that they were actual comparators within section 23 had no reasonable prospect of success; and for this reason it concluded that his conduct in continuing to pursue his claim to trial after that date was unreasonable.  The tribunal also considered that the claimant had acted unreasonably in fighting on to a full hearing, rather than accepting an offer of settlement which the respondent had made, by way of a renewed offer to settle for &#163;10,000 that it reiterated on 10 December 2021, but which the claimant rejected.  </span></p>

Ms&#160;Ling noted that in its original grounds of resistance the respondent relied only upon differences in salaries and the existence of performance concerns in relation to the claimant, but not S and P.  It had not originally relied also on a difference in roles.

In fact, none of the comparators&#8217; pay slips for the entire furlough period from April 2021 onwards were provided as part of the original disclosure.

Ms&#160;Ling submitted that these were material further evidence, because, in the discussion at the start of April 2020, the claimant had offered to the respondent to be furloughed at a salary no higher than the CJRS guarantee, and hence at no cost to the respondent, but that offer was rejected; whereas the respondent had been prepared later to cap P&#8217;s furloughed salary in that way for the month of July 2020, something on which he sought to rely.</span></p>

Originally, Ms&#160;Ling&#8217;s first point was that, as the tribunal acknowledged, and in line with the guidance in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Yerrakalva v Barnsley MBC</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> [2011] EWCA Civ 1255; [2012] ICR 420; the costs awarded needed to be broadly referable to costs incurred in the relevant period.  Originally she advanced a criticism that the tribunal had relied on figures in the respondent&#8217;s summary schedule, which only showed the total of costs incurred since 18 November 2021 without distinguishing what part of these had been incurred after 9 December.  However, she acknowledged in discussion that, on scrutiny of the tribunal&#8217;s decision and the available evidence, it appears, as stated also in that schedule of costs, that witness statements were in fact exchanged on 5 November 2021, rather than 9 December, as the tribunal appears to have assumed at that point in its costs decision.  So this difference in dates may not be so significant a factor.  </span></p>

In particular the solicitors&#8217; costs during this period of just over &#163;19,000 included 47.6 hours spent by the associate who formed part of a team consisting of a partner, an associate and a paralegal.  The tribunal appeared to have given no consideration to that very large number of hours.  Ms&#160;Ling surmised that the high figure might perhaps indicate that the associate had attended the three-day hearing with counsel.  But, if so, the tribunal had not considered whether that was reasonable or necessary.</span></p>

As to the first strand of the challenge to the first costs decision, Ms&#160;Ling fairly makes the point that, in considering whether the claimant in a discrimination claim ought reasonably at a certain point to have realised that his claim had no reasonable prospect of success, the tribunal needs to keep in mind the difficulties of proving discrimination in a case which turns on matters said to have influenced the mind, consciously or unconsciously, of the alleged discriminator or discriminators, and the potential importance of the opportunity to put the alleged discriminator&#8217;s stated explanation to the test through the process of cross-examination at a trial.  On the other hand, as the authorities also recognise, there can be cases where it may be said that, for example, contemporaneous documentation is so compelling and unambiguous in the light that it casts on the true reasons for the impugned conduct that, once disclosed, it can be relied upon as itself demonstrating that there is no reasonable prospect of the complaint succeeding at trial.</span></p>

In the costs jurisdiction, in the nature of things, the exercise is usually carried out in point of time after a trial, by which time the tribunal has itself been exposed to all of the evidence and reached its conclusions.

Nevertheless, the claimant was still not totally bereft of material to work with in challenging the respondent&#8217;s case in this regard, given the evidence that P&#8217;s record was not, on the respondent&#8217;s own case, entirely spotless and that he had received indications that there was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">some</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> need for improvement on his part as well.</span></p>

But what the tribunal did not do is consider whether the claimant had reasonably pressed for further disclosure of pay slips, or whether the email, and/or the relevant pay slip for P, might be reasonably relied upon by him as at least providing a strand of his own case challenging the respondent&#8217;s reliance on the cost of furloughing him as being part of the explanation why it did not do so.</span></p>

But I do see force in Ms&#160;Ling&#8217;s submission that what it said at [42] gives rise to a concern that it set the bar too high for the claimant, given its reference to an allegation of direct race discrimination being a serious allegation.

Nevertheless, in the first costs decision the tribunal focussed specifically on the question of whether the claimant ought to have realised that there was no reasonable prospect of P and S being found to be actual comparators without giving any further express consideration to whether he might nevertheless have had a reasonable basis for considering that he still had an arguable case by reference to a hypothetical comparator and/or relying on features relating to either or both of P and S as evidentially of assistance.</span></p>

The tribunal&#8217;s reliance on the claimant&#8217;s decision to fight on after having received and rejected a reiterated offer of &#163;10,000 to settle on 10 December 2021 must also fall away, as this was essentially parasitic on its conclusion that he ought reasonably to have considered that he had no reasonable prospect of success.

The tribunal&#8217;s own partial answer to that concern was that part of the explanation might be that further expenses had been partially funded by such a loan, although the tribunal&#8217;s view was that that could still not sufficiently explain how he had been able to cover the whole of the expenditure that it inferred he must have been incurring.

On the one hand, the tribunal is concerned only with the means or ability to pay of the individual concerned, and should therefore not presumptively take into account the means of others.  On the other, if the tribunal does have evidence that the proposed payee in fact can call on financial support from a third party, it may potentially be entitled to take that actual evidence into account. (See the discussion in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Abaya v Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> UKEAT/258/16.)  What matters in the present case, however, is that the tribunal did not consider this evidence.  </span></p>

Whilst such an inference can be properly drawn in appropriate cases, the tribunal should take care before doing so, particularly in a case where it will have a direct consequence in terms of the amount of a costs order, and particularly where, as in this case, that decision was reached on paper without the tribunal having had a further hearing.</span></p>

The tribunal was on this occasion engaged in an exercise of summary assessment and it had before it a summary costs schedule.  This certainly showed the figures that the tribunal cited in its decision as having been incurred after 18 November 2021 and described as being in respect of preparing for, and attending, the final hearing from 5 to 7 January 2022.  It is, however, difficult to tell from the formatting and content of the schedule whether or not that figure also included the cost of the disclosure exercise which was completed in the second half of December 2021.  That said, that perhaps would, on any view have been a relatively limited cost compared to the cost of preparing for and attending the trial, including counsel&#8217;s fees.</span></p>

It might be said that the figure of &#163;10,000 was one that the tribunal could reasonably have regarded as fair and proportionate; and Ms&#160;Ling fairly acknowledged that she did not say that an award of that amount would in that sense have been perverse, leaving aside the issue as to the claimant&#8217;s means.  Ms&#160;Ling, however, said that there was at the very least an insufficiency of reasoning as to how the tribunal had arrived at the figure of &#163;10,000, other than it being the limit of the amount that the respondent was seeking.</span></p>

However, I observe that in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Yerrakalva</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> the total costs sought by the respondent were some &#163;92,000; and the language of &#8220;reasonably and necessarily incurred&#8221; suggests that Mummery LJ probably had in mind the test that would have been applied at that time to the detailed assessment that would have been necessary, even in relation to a potential award of up to 50% of that amount.  In the present case, the tribunal was engaged in an exercise of summary assessment and I do not think that it would be bound to apply the &#8220;reasonably and necessarily incurred&#8221; test.  </span></p>

This tribunal did not do that.  Had I not allowed the appeal against the first costs decision, I would therefore, in any event, have allowed the appeal in respect of the amount awarded in the second costs decision.  </span></p>
