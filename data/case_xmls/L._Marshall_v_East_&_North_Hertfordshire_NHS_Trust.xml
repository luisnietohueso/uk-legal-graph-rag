They advised him that the claimant should go home for her own benefit and the preservation of her own mental health. Mr McCabe merely acceded to that advice and put it into practice.

It considered the section 15 </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">EqA </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">complaints at ET &#167; 70 to 74, but failed to mention this issue at all in relation to the detriment identified at ET &#167; 24.5. The reasonable inference was that the tribunal had simply overlooked it. In relation to this single allegation of detriment, rather than focussing upon sickness absence as the &#8220;something arising&#8221; from disability, the tribunal should have focussed upon the issue of the appellant&#8217;s conduct and asked itself (i) whether her behaviour on 21 September 2019 arose from her disability of anxiety and depression; (ii) whether the decision to send her home was because of that behaviour; (iii) whether that was unfavourable treatment; and (iv) if so, whether it was justified as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. The tribunal had, however, asked itself none of those questions. In the absence of any consideration of those issues, its decision to dismiss this aspect of the section 15 complaint was an error of law. </span></p>

It required to consider and rule upon a very large number of issues. Whilst acknowledging that, the inescapable conclusion is that it did not consider or rule upon the issue identified at ET &#167; 24.5 and 27 as to whether the appellant&#8217;s conduct on 21 September 2019 arose from her disability. Inevitably, therefore, to the extent that it may have been necessary for the tribunal to do so, it did not rule on the issues of whether the respondent&#8217;s reaction to that conduct was unfavourable and, if so, whether or not it was justified. </span></p>
