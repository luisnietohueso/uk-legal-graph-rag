In my judgment it does not have that effect.  I consider that the clauses of the SHA pleaded in the PoC as &#8220;relevant to the claim&#8221; are so pleaded because they are the clauses which are alleged to give rise to the claim.  They are not pleaded as those which are relevant to the interpretation of the clauses which give rise to the claim.   My judgment in that regard is reinforced by the considerations:</span></p>

The first is that, pending the appointment of Mr Rajani, Mr Fane has not had access to the board papers, including, for example: (i) up-to-date management accounts, including a profit and loss account, a balance sheet, a cash flow forecast and a one-year projection showing the anticipated position at the end of the year, including budgeted overhead; (ii) a business plan for the current and, if available, next financial years; (iii) draft statutory accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2020; (iv) a projected outcome statement in relation to the CVA; (v) a detailed loan data tape, including provisions (if any), and a schedule of any off-balance sheet assets and liabilities; (vi) a detailed note relating to investments in other companies, including numbers of shares owned at present, current valuations and supporting information and documents.</span></p>

The reason is quite simple: if the respondent&#8217;s case is bad in law, he will in truth have no real prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending the claim against him, as the case may be. Similarly, if the applicant&#8217;s case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined, the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although material in the form of documents or oral evidence that would put the documents in another light is not currently before the court, such material is likely to exist and can be expected to be available at trial, it would be wrong to give summary judgment because there would be a real, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success.

It will bear in mind the clarity of the evidence available and the potential for other evidence to be available at trial which is likely to bear on the issues. It will avoid conducting a mini-trial. But there will be cases where the Court will be entitled to draw a line and say that - even bearing well in mind all of those points - it would be contrary to principle for a case to proceed to trial. </span></p>

In succinctly stating and explaining the principles to be applied, Aiken LJ noted that the circumstances in which the court will be prepared to grant declaratory relief have been widened considerably in modern times (ibid. at paras 118 to 120). There is nothing in the general statements found in the modern authorities as to the general principles applicable that requires that a declaration may not be granted unless there is an actual or imminent threat to a legal right (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Pavledes v Hadjisavva</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> [2013] EWHC 124 (Ch) (David Richards J)).

Buckley LJ explained (at p.1029) that this rule is &#8220;a practice of very long standing&#8221; (see also </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">New Brunswick Railway Co Ltd v British &amp; French Trust Corp Ltd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> [1939] A.C. 1, and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Metzger v Department of Social Security</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> [1977] 3 All E.R. 444, at p.451, per Megarry VC).

The declaration sought was to the effect that on numerous occasions the defendant had acted in breach of the Banking Act 1987. The judge held that the declaration could be granted provided the facts were established to the court&#8217;s satisfaction on a balance of probabilities (and bearing in mind that the court would have to be strongly persuaded as to allegations of dishonesty). The judge found that, in the circumstances, there was no realistic possibility of the defendant showing that the facts alleged were wrong; consequently, although at the hearing of the summary judgment application there had been no disclosure of documents, no exchange of witness statements and no examination and cross-examination of witnesses, the factual basis for the declarations sought had been made out.</span></p>

Assuming in the Defendants&#8217; favour that that is correct as a matter of law, the pleading and the evidence do not identify which classes of the information specified in clause 11.2 of the SHA are affected nor how or to what extent.  Further, the alleged confidentiality does not appear to have caused a problem in the production of the audited accounts for the Group for the period own to 31 December 2022.

That conclusion is reinforced by the consideration that there is no evidence as to the possibility of getting the FCA&#8217;s consent to the use of the allegedly confidential information or of any attempt to do so.</span></p>

The allegation in paragraph 26.3 of the Defence that the Claimant did not request the provision of any information is not expressly denied in the Reply, nor does the Claimant deny it in his statement in support of the Application.  The Claimant does exhibit what he describes as relevant correspondence wherein he sought the information and the Company&#8217;s response.  However, the first item of this exhibited correspondence is a letter from the Claimant&#8217;s solicitors dated 23 January 2023.  Therefore, in my view the Defendants have a prospect, which is better than the real prospect standard, of establishing the allegation in clause 26.3 of the Defence that the Claimant did not complain about the provision of documentation under clause 11.2 of the SHA from 2019 until 17 January 2023.  What is more doubtful is whether the Defendants can show that there is a real prospect of it being established that it has become unconscionable for the Claimant to enforce his rights under clause 11.2 or any of its individual sub-clauses. </span></p>

In my judgment that lack of clarity is not especially important because in view of the similarity of those orders, analogous practices frequently apply to them.  In particular I have in mind the statement in paragraph 31-050 of Chitty on Contracts to the effect that the court may, instead of denying specific performance, make adjustments to the specific performance order to mitigate its harshness, taking into account the proportionality between the adverse consequences of specific performance without adjustment, the defendant&#8217;s degree of fault, and the adequacy of damages to compensate the claimant for any variation of its entitlement.</span></p>

That letter asks for the clause 11.2 information, but does not state why it is needed.  The 17 January 2023 letter refers back to an earlier letter dated 23 August 2021.  The 23 August 2021 letter refers to the Claimant not having been provided with information as a result of which he lost the opportunity to exercise his pre-emption rights in respect of Mr Naldini&#8217;s shares.  That indicates that at that time the Claimant required the information so as to assist him in valuing Mr Naldini&#8217;s shares and the value of shares in the Company before and after any potential purchase.  That is a different reason from the reason submitted to me as to why the Claimant needs the clause 11.2 information now, which was so that he could assess the value of his own shares.  </span></p>

If damages were an adequate remedy, that would be a reason for not granting specific performance of or an injunction in respect of the clause 11.2 obligation.

In this context the &#8220;following information&#8221; was the material specified in clause 11.2 of the SHA.

Accordingly, the admission of paragraph 30 of the PoC does not prevent the Defendants from arguing that, where it is apparent on the face of clause 11.2, that that clause refers to documents containing information, it is the documents containing the information, if the documents existed to which the Claimant is contractually entitled.

However, this point is not as strong as it might appear when looked at in isolation.  That is because clauses 11.3 and 11.4 of the SHA give the Claimant rights to information relevant to prospective sales of his shares.

The management accounts might provide more detail than the audited annual accounts, but they appear to me to be substantially historical documents. No reason or evidence was given as to why the Claimant needed, additionally to the audited annual accounts, the management accounts for this period.  In these circumstances it appears to me that there is at least a realistic prospect that no purpose would be served by ordering the provision of the management accounts for the period down to 31 December 2022.  Further, although there was no evidence as to how much it would cost to produce these accounts, clearly it would cost something and, coupled with Mr Warren&#8217;s evidence referred to above as to the time and effort which production of historical documents would entail, in my judgment there is a realistic prospect that, balanced against the provision of audited yearly accounts and the lack of evidence as to why they are needed by the Claimant, the cost of performance would be wholly out of proportion to the benefit which the performance would confer on the Claimant.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In respect of the period after 31 December 2022, Mr Warren&#8217;s evidence is that the Company intends to produce management accounts for the Company at 6 monthly intervals.  Accordingly, there appears to be no real objection to the provision of these to the Claimant and substantially discounts the possibility of Mr Warren&#8217;s evidence as to the impracticability of producing and providing &#8220;much of the information&#8221; sought under clause 11.2 from applying in this context.  However, what the Company was saying it would do is not what clause 11.2(a) requires.  Clause 11.2(a) requires the provision of monthly (not 6 monthly) management accounts within 15 business days after the end of each month for the Group (not just for the Company).  The audited annual accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023 have yet to be provided.  In these circumstances the two arguments that no purpose would served by ordering provision of the monthly accounts and that the cost of performance would be wholly out of proportion to the benefit which the performance would confer on the Claimant are not strong.  It is difficult to see that no useful purpose would be served by ordering the production of monthly management accounts for the period after 31 December 2022.  Although no doubt it would cost more in terms of employee time and accountant&#8217;s time to produce monthly Group management accounts than it would to produce 6 monthly management accounts for the Company alone, on the existing evidence, the cost of performance is very unlikely to be wholly out of proportion to the benefit which the performance would confer on the Claimant.  Is there a realistic prospect of an argument to the contrary being successful?  In my judgment if and insofar as the required monthly management accounts cover periods covered by other accounts, there would be a real prospect of success on the basis that the provision of the monthly management accounts for that period would be of historical interest only, and would not assist the Claimant in his desire to ascertain the value of his shares.  In respect of periods which are not covered in that way, if the existing evidence was the only evidence, there would not be a realistic prospect of a successful defence to this element of the claim on the grounds that provision of the accounts would serve no purpose or that the cost of performance would be wholly out of proportion to the benefit which the performance would confer on the Claimant.  Monthly management accounts for the Group were what were contracted to be provided; they would assist the Claimant is assessing the value of his shares; no good reason has been advanced in evidence or in argument as to why the Company could not provide monthly management accounts for the Group at reasonable cost or that the cost would be out of proportion to the benefit which the Claimant would obtain from receiving these management accounts.  However, that is not the end of the matter so far as possible judgment on clause 11(2)(a) is concerned. </span></p>

However, the Defendants have had an opportunity to put in evidence of this nature.  They have failed to do so. Given the Company&#8217;s intention to produce 6 monthly management accounts for itself, I consider that further evidence as to the practicability and cost of producing monthly Group management accounts, if any, if available at trial, is not reasonably likely to affect the result.</span></p>

Mr Warren says that a weekly cash flow report has not been produced since October 2020 and that &#8220;cash-flow modelling is now undertaken on an ad hoc basis&#8221;.  In his statement Mr Warren says that the Claimant will be provided with a copy of any report as and when these are produced.  In accordance with my above conclusion as to the effect of the use of the definite article, &#8220;the&#8221;, in my judgment there is no obligation on the Company to create and provide copies of reports under this head which do not exist.

The Defendants have produced no admissible extrinsic evidence to oust the usual and natural meaning of the words of clause 11.2(i).  Those meanings are that it applies to all emails which were sent for information to &#8220;all directors&#8221;.  What clause 11.2(i) does not do is to state from whom the emails referred to in it have to come from.  Is it the Company only or is it any person, including shareholders and third parties?  That is some context indicating that a particular class of emails, possibly those sent on the director email distribution group was intended.  A further consideration for restricting the scope of clause 11.2(i) is that if it was not restricted, it would be difficult or impossible for the Company to comply if, as is likely, it was not copied in on all the emails which were sent by third parties to all the directors, especially where directors have retired safter the emails were received by them.</span></p>

Mr Warren says that the Company no longer has any Board Committees and has not had a Board Committee since the commencement of the CVA.  There are, says Mr Warren, therefore no documents created within this category since September 2020.  So far as summary judgment is concerned that evidence is conclusive to the effect that there is a real prospect of it being established that an order in respect of these documents in respect of the period after September 2020 would serve no useful purpose.  As regards the period between January 2019 and September 2020 is concerned: any committee minutes for this period are prima facie likely to be of historical interest only.  No reason was given as to why the Claimant required these.  Accordingly, in my judgment there is a real prospect of it being established that an order for the provision of the pre-September 2020 committee minutes would be pointless or would serve no purpose or that the cost of performance of it would be out of proportion to benefit which performance of the obligation would provide to the Claimant.

As regards the inclusion of former spouses of the first group of persons, but not of a member the explanation could be that the animosity arising from a divorce was more likely to be aimed at the member and the Company than it would be in the case of a former spouse of a person in the first group of persons who would, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">ex hypothesi</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, have been at least one relationship removed from the member and hence from the Company.  Another, and in my view better, explanation could be that given that the clause is concerned with transfers of shares legally and/or beneficially owned by a member, if a divorce from the member did not cause a spouse of the member to cease to be a &#8220;Privileged Relation&#8221;, a member&#8217;s shares might get transferred to their former spouse by an order of the divorce court when neither the member nor the other members wished for that to happen.  Both Mr Burton&#8217;s and Mr Horton&#8217;s submissions mentioned in this paragraph have some force but I prefer Mr Horton&#8217;s because it gains strong support from Article 49.6.</span></p>

If the Deed had been effective to transfer or dispose of a 50% beneficial interest in the shares to Ms Emma Fane, it would be too late to serve a Transfer Notice because the interest would already have been transferred or disposed of.   Accordingly, I treat the Defendants&#8217; use of the word &#8220;invalid&#8221; in the Counterclaim as meaning &#8220;ineffective&#8221; or &#8220;of no legal effect&#8221;.</span></p>

In particular I was not referred to any authority on the question whether a transfer of a beneficial interest in shares which the Articles provided should not be effected before a Transfer Notice was served is (i) analogous to the assignment of leases in breach of covenant where the assignment is effective, but is a breach of the terms of the lease giving rise to a right in the landlord to forfeit; or (ii) is analogous to an assignment of the benefit of a contract in breach of a term of the contract providing that the benefit of the contract is unassignable except with the consent of the other party, when that provision makes a purported assignment of the benefit of the contract ineffective as between the putative assignor and the putative assignee on the one hand and the other original party to the contract on the other; albeit that the assignment may still have some effect as between the putative assignor and the putative assignee.   The rationale for the first line of cases is that what is being assigned is an interest in property rather than a mere contractual interest.  An ordinary share in a company is frequently treated as an item of property which gives rise to both contractual and statutory rights. Thus, an assignment of an interest in a share may be closer to the assignment of lease line of cases than to the purely contractual line of cases.  On the other hand, pre-emption rights in respect of the disposition of shares are commonplace in the articles of companies and in the case of pre-emption rights in respect of legal title to shares, a failure to have complied with the requirements for a transfer will generally result in the company being obliged not to register the transfer.  With both Mr Burton and Mr Horton having proceeded on the basis that if Article 50 required service of a Transfer Notice, the effect of Article 50.1 was that if a Transfer Notice had not been served the purported transfer of the 50% beneficial interest would have been ineffective, at least as between the Claimant, the other members and the Company,  I consider that it would be wrong for me to attempt to decide that point either differently or at all without hearing proper argument on the point.</span></p>

In this context the Claimant&#8217;s statement that he has never wished to transfer 50% of his shares other than pursuant to a permitted transfer could, unlike in the context where I have considered it above, have weight because the present context arises on the hypothesis that there has not been a transfer or disposition of the 50% beneficial interest, so the statement by the Claimant as to his wishes would not be inconsistent with clause 1b of the Deed. </span></p>

Article 49.5 and the obligations imposed by it are concerned with shares and the context does not require any meaning to be given to &#8220;holder&#8221; other than the defined meaning in Article 1.1.  On the contrary, in my judgment the context indicates that &#8220;holder&#8221; means the registered holder of the shares.  First because it is the &#8220;holder&#8221; whom the Article requires to give the Transfer Notice and (i) on a release of a Charge, the chargee would have no interest in giving a notice, while the member would and (ii) Transfer Notices under Article 50 are Notices which are given by a member.

Even with those amendments, I would not be willing to make the declaration.  That is because although the courts can and do make declarations in respect of the consequences of possible future sets of circumstances, the court will need to be satisfied that the future circumstances are clearly defined.  In my judgment a &#8220;proposed exercise of a power of sale&#8221; is something which will become clear at some stage prior to a sale, but the precise time at which it does so is likely to be unclear.  Further, the duty to notify the Directors and to give a Transfer Notice under Article 49.5 in the event of a release or proposed exercise of the power of sale is subject to an exception if the Relevant Shares are then transferred to the member from whom they were transferred pursuant to the Charge or a Permitted Transferee thereof other than a Permitted Transferee pursuant to Article 49, any such transfer being deemed to be authorised under Article 49.  If the declaration sought was to be amended to include that exception, the declaration would be doing not more than repeating the terms of Article 49.5 in circumstances where it was not known precisely what transaction might take place in the future which would or might trigger the clause 49.5 obligations.  Those uncertainties and result mean that in my judgment it would be inappropriate to make a declaration in that amended form. </span></p>

I agree that the meaning and effect of the part of clause 17.6 which deals with the crystallisation of a mortgage or charge is opaque.  However, if that second part of clause 17.6 is restricted to floating charges, then clearly it would not be engaged by the Charge because the Charge is not a floating charge.</span></p>

Be that as it may, subject to any extraordinary admissible extrinsic evidence relevant to the interpretation of clause 17.6, my view on the terms of the document would be that the creation of the Charge did not contravene the provisions of clause 17.6 of the SHA.  However, by reason of the conditional admission in paragraph 19 of the Defence and the acceptance that the Charge was executed and contained the terms set out in paragraph 9 of the PoC and that a genuine loan was made by Plutus to the Claimant, I do not have to and do not rule on whether that view is correct.

I consider that the possible impact on third parties of a declaration as sought in paragraph 9 of the Draft Order would be zero or insignificant.  As regards Plutus, the declaration sought is in Plutus&#8217;s favour, therefore there would be no prejudice to Plutus.  Further, unlike the position in relation to the possibility of a purported transfer of a beneficial interest in breach of the Articles nevertheless being an effective transfer of that beneficial interest, I am satisfied that all the arguments have been put to me in respect of the issue of whether or not the Charge contravened the provisions of Article 17.6, so the possible effects of the declaration on third parties is not something which in this instance has any significant influence against my making the declaration sought. </span></p>
