The School promoted Equality Diversity and Inclusion (&#8220;EDI&#8221;) initiatives and teachers were asked to display &#8220;Christian Ethos, Curriculum and Equalities, Diversity and Inclusion&#8221; posters in their classrooms. The Claimant did display the poster but then informed Mr Kings, the Chaplain, that she was not willing to continue to do so.  The Claimant was frequently expected to share LGBTQ+ information and resources, including videos, with her pupils, in PHSE and Religious Studies lessons. She showed some LGBTQ+ material to her classes, but she found it distressing, misleading, and contrary to her beliefs, and so stopped doing so.</p>

Her mother advised her to make notes of what was said in class the next time this occurred. About a month later, on 8 February 2022, Pupil A took brief notes of the Claimant&#8217;s comments and informed her parents. Her mother used the notes as the basis of an email to the School, complaining that the Claimant&#8217;s comments were &#8220;very distressing&#8221; to Pupil A &#8220;who strongly believes people should be who they are&#8221; and she is &#8220;exploring who she is &#8211; as many children are at this age&#8221;.

Regulation 15 ensures the publication of particulars that might not necessarily have featured in the reasoned decision, but which are necessary to enable employers and the public to satisfy themselves that an applicant for a teaching position is not prohibited from taking it up by reference to the register of prohibited teachers maintained under section 141C EA 2002. </p>

However, it should be remembered that school teachers are in a very influential position and their actions and responsibilities are bound by much wider duties than this legislation. A teacher&#8217;s ability to express his or her views should not extend to allowing them to discriminate against others. &#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Phillips&#8217; account of the evidence in his skeleton argument at paragraphs 26 and 27 is incomplete.  First, although her comments were a response to questions from pupils, the discussion was initiated by the Claimant.  The Claimant&#8217;s evidence, at paragraph 63 of her witness statement, was that she had viewed the slides provided for the lesson, and they caused her discomfort and concern. She decided that she could not teach anything related to the LGBTQ+ ideology.  Therefore she &#8220;<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">started</span> the lesson by saying that as a Christian I do not support the LGBT ideology &#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">[t]hen</span>, some pupils &#8230;.started to put their hands up and were asking some questions, which I was happy to answer&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">emphasis added</span>).  Second, it is incorrect to assert that the PCP did not have any evidence before them of other similar incidents.  Although the PCP was only concerned with the allegations before it, evidence was given by Pupil A that the Claimant had made &#8220;transphobic&#8221; remarks in a class about a month earlier, as a result of which her mother advised her to take notes in future.  </p>

The PCP found her evidence to be &#8220;measured and reflective&#8221;.

The Claimant&#8217;s decision not to show a video about LGBTQ+ issues to her class and to remove an EDI poster from her classroom was part of the history and the context that the Claimant provided in her own evidence, to explain and justify her actions.

This was indeed a Christian school, but the Claimant&#8217;s own evidence was that she had been unwilling to support that school&#8217;s policy. The result was the nuanced finding that while &#8220;Ms Leger&#8217;s comments lacked respect for the right of others&#8221; this did not derive &#8220;from a lack of a tolerance&#8221; nor had she any &#8220;intention of causing distress to pupils&#8221;. That said, her &#8220;actions were at risk of upsetting pupils in the lesson&#8221; and her &#8220;choice not to present a balanced view undermined the School community&#8217;s aspiration to provide a supportive environment for children who may be exploring sexual identity&#8221;.

Instead she had decided to explain her Christian beliefs to the class, because the pupils were being given a &#8220;one-sided narrative&#8221; (paragraph 35, Claimant&#8217;s witness statement).

These matters were plainly relevant as part of the context within which the alleged unprofessional conduct occurred.  She was questioned about them at the hearing and explained her reasoning. Her reasoning would not have been any different even if the matters complained of had been included in the allegations. The fact that the Claimant&#8217;s explanation of the context within which she made her comments may have undermined, rather than assisted, her case does not render it unfair for the PCP to have regard to that explanation. </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;40 The Convention principle of legality requires the court to address itself to three distinct questions. The first is whether there is a legal basis in domestic law for the restriction. The second is whether the law or rule in question is sufficiently accessible to the individual who is affected by the restriction, and sufficiently precise to enable him to understand its scope and foresee the consequences of his actions so that he can regulate his conduct without breaking the law. The third is whether, assuming that these two requirements are satisfied, it is nevertheless open to the criticism that it is being applied in a way that is arbitrary because, for example, it has been resorted to in bad faith or in a way that is not proportionate. I derive these principles, which have been mentioned many times in subsequent cases, from <span style="font-style:italic">Sunday Times v United Kingdom </span>(1979) 2 EHRR 245, para 49 and also from <span style="font-style:italic">Winterwerp v The Netherlands</span> (1979) 2 EHRR 387, para 39; <span style="font-style:italic">Engel v The Netherlands (No 1)</span> (1976) 1 EHRR 647, paras 58&#8212;59 which were concerned with the principle of legality in the context of article 5(1), <span style="font-style:italic">Silver v United Kingdom</span> (1983) 5 EHRR 347, paras 85&#8212;90; <span style="font-style:italic">Liberty v United Kingdom</span> (2008) 48 EHRR 1, para 59 and <span style="font-style:italic">Sorvisto v Finland</span> (Application No 19348/04) (unreported) given 13 January 2009, para 112.</p>

This qualification of the concept is important, as it makes it clear that law for this purpose goes beyond the mere words of the statute. As the Grand Chamber said in that case, in paras 139&#8212;140, it has been held to include both enactments of lower rank than statutes and unwritten law. Furthermore, it implies qualitative requirements, including those of accessibility and foreseeability. Accessibility means that an individual must know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the court&#8217;s interpretation of it what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable: see also <span style="font-style:italic">Gulmez v Turkey</span> (Application No 16330/02) (unreported) given 20 May 2008, para 49. The requirement of foreseeability will be satisfied where the person concerned is able to foresee, if need be with appropriate legal advice, the consequences which a given action may entail. A law which confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with this requirement, provided the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity to give the individual protection against interference which is arbitrary: <span style="font-style:italic">Goodwin v United Kingdom</span> (1996) 22 EHRR 123, para 31; <span style="font-style:italic">Sorvisto v Finland</span>, para 112.&#8221;</p>

These four requirements are logically separate, but in practice they inevitably overlap because the same facts are likely to be relevant to more than one of them.&#8221;</p>

In the <span style="font-style:italic">Karaduman</span> case, measures taken in universities to prevent certain fundamentalist religious movements from exerting pressure on students who did not practise their religion or who belonged to another religion were found to be justi&#64257;ed under Art.9(2) of the Convention. Consequently, it is established that institutions of higher education may regulate the manifestation of the rites and symbols of a religion by imposing restrictions as to the place and manner of such manifestation with the aim of ensuring peaceful co-existence between students of various faiths and thus protecting public order and the beliefs of others. In the <span style="font-style:italic">Dahlab</span> case, which concerned the teacher of a class of small children, the Court stressed among other matters the &#8220;powerful external symbol&#8221; which her wearing a headscarf represented and questioned whether it might have some kind of proselytising effect, seeing that it appeared to be imposed on women by a religious precept that was hard to reconcile with the principle of gender equality. It also noted that wearing the Islamic headscarf could not easily be reconciled with the message of tolerance, respect for others and, above all, equality and non-discrimination that all teachers in a democratic society should convey to their pupils.&#8221;</p>

I do not accept that submission. Applying the relevant legal principles, as set out in the judgment of Lord Hope in <span style="font-style:italic">Purdy </span>(paragraph 83 above), the legal basis for the interference is the statutory scheme for the regulation of teachers set out in the EA 2002 and the 2012 Regulations (see paragraphs 27 - 35 above).  The Teachers&#8217; Standards and the Advice provide guidance on the standards of behaviour required, and what amounts to teacher misconduct (see paragraphs 36 &#8211; 38 above). Given the discretion and evaluative judgment which is appropriately conferred on the PCP and the Secretary of State, it is not possible to set out every possible eventuality in advance (<span style="font-style:italic">Ngole </span>at [87]). The statutory scheme, read together with the guidance, meet the requirements of accessibility and foreseeability.  </p>

Given that the nature and severity of the behaviour were at the less serious end of the possible spectrum and, having considered the mitigating factors that were present, the panel determined that a recommendation for a prohibition order would not be appropriate in this case. The panel considered that the publication of the adverse findings it had made was sufficient to send an appropriate message to the teacher as to the standards of behaviour that are not acceptable, and the publication would meet the public interest requirement of declaring proper standards of the teaching profession. The panel considered that this was the least intrusive measure that could be imposed on the facts of this case (as per Principle 3 of the Bank Mellat principles).&#8221;</p>

Whilst there was no evidence that the Claimant had sought and failed to find employment as a consequence of the decision or its publication, it is reasonable to assume that it would count against her.

Publication equips employers to make informed judgements on the suitability of applicants applying for teaching positions, in line with the &#8216;safer recruitment&#8217; principles set out in [&#8216;Keeping children safe in education 2023: Statutory guidance for schools]. It is clearly in the public interest for all those who use the services of teachers (including schools and other educators, as well as parents who engage tutors) to know whether the said individual has a finding of serious misconduct against them by their regulator. Where a teacher is found guilty of serious misconduct, a check of the list of prohibited persons alone would not provide the reasons why a prohibition order was (or was not) made in light of this finding. Employers may use these published decisions to help them to assess the suitability of a given candidate for a particular role, providing a more objective basis for their decision-making than might otherwise be available from other sources (such as media coverage or referees). Publishing these details equips schools, colleges and others to make informed judgements about safeguarding risk and suitability &#8211; which may well support teachers found guilty of serious misconduct to return to teaching where a prohibition order was not made.</p>

Teachers or other persons may apply to restrict certain material from publication, which will lead to the decision maker weighing the proportionality and impact of redacting the information against the public interest in publishing it. Whether or not an application is made, the PCP may make suggestions to the decision maker that certain information is redacted. In this case, the PCP did not make any such suggestion. </p>

In this case, for the reasons outlined above, the public interest in publishing the findings in the context of the proven allegations weigh significantly in favour of publication. The publication of the findings is a lesser sanction than making a prohibition order but supports the safeguarding and wellbeing of pupils, the maintenance of public confidence in the profession and the upholding of proper standards of conduct within the teaching profession.&#8221;</p>

Given that the nature and severity of the behaviour were at the less serious end of the possible spectrum and, having considered the mitigating factors that were present, the panel determined that a recommendation for a prohibition order would not be appropriate in this case. The panel considered that the publication of the adverse findings it had made was sufficient to send an appropriate message to the teacher as to the standards of behaviour that are not acceptable, and the publication would meet the public interest requirement of declaring proper standards of the teaching profession. The panel considered that this was the least intrusive measure that could be imposed on the facts of this case (as per Principle 3 of the Bank Mellat principles).&#8221;</p>
