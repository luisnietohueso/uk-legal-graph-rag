Some of the claims were brought as early as 2018. In my judgment after a Preliminary Hearing on 27 November 2024 I noted that none of the claims have been determined, which is extremely troubling, especially because questions such as whether the work of someone working in a shop is of equal value to that of someone working in a warehouse is not conceptually highly complicated and should be capable of resolution within a reasonable period, even though the claims are potentially of a very high total value. I also stated that the potential high total value of the claims is no justification for a war of attrition but a reason for the parties to apply their resources wisely to clarify and simplify the dispute. The overriding objective applies to proceedings both large and small.</span></p>

In  particular, it goes to the question of whether paying Stores colleagues at the rate the  Respondent did (which it says was in line with the prevailing market rate), and not  above that rate, was in furtherance of a real business need. Both parties have pleaded  cases as to what would have happened had the Respondent paid more. This goes to  the  linked  questions  of  the  legitimacy  of  the  Respondent&#8217;s  aims  and  the  proportionality of the means adopted. While, again, factual evidence will be led by  the Respondent, questions as to the consequences of paying more than the market  rate raise matters of assessment and opinion.

Production of such expert reports is expensive, time-consuming and may ultimately be counter-productive. That is precisely why CPR Pt 35.1 exists. In my view it is the duty of parties, particularly those involved in large scale commercial litigation, to ensure that they adhere to both the letter and spirit of that Rule. And it is the duty of the court, even if only for its own protection, to reject firmly all expert evidence that is not reasonably required to resolve the proceedings.</span></p>

If the application had been made under the statutory scheme it was highly unlikely that the claimant would have been medically examined and so he had lost the chance of receiving the higher payment on the application of the rough and ready assessment under the scheme.

Tesco were content for me to do so, but the claimants contended that I should only do so if I concluded that the only possible decision was that the expert evidence was necessary or was not necessary. If a discretionary decision was required it should be remitted to the Employment Tribunal. I can only determine issues if the parties agree or there is only one possible answer. The parties do not agree to my determining the issue and I do not consider that there is only one possible answer.</span></p>

The claimants contend that the remission should be to the same Employment Tribunal because the determination was not totally flawed, Employment Judge Hyams has been managing these hugely complex proceedings for a number of years and is familiar with them and remission could only be to an Employment Judge who is ticketed to conduct Equal Pay proceedings. I have considered the principles set out in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Sinclair Roche &amp; Temperley v Heard</span><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] IRLR 763" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] IRLR 763</ref>. While I consider that the errors of law were unfortunate and serious, I consider that the judgment falls short of being totally flawed. I also consider it has to be seen in the context of the enormous burden of judging such litigation when large legal teams produce vast amounts of material. While the judge lost sight of the correct test to be applied to determining whether to admit expert evidence I consider that he can be trusted now to focus on the correct test and to apply it properly without attempting a second bite of the cherry. I have confidence in his professionalism and that on an application of the correct test and consideration of all of the relevant factors he will allow the application if he concludes that is the correct decision or refuse it if that is the correct decision. I have sought to avoid giving any hint of what I might have decided had the parties agreed that I retake the decision and nothing in this judgment should be seen as giving a steer. I would only add that all parties are represented by leading and junior Counsel with great expertise and experience in equal pay litigation. Particularly where they agree the correct approach to the law, very great care should be taken before deciding that they are all wrong and that a different test is to be applied.</span></p>
