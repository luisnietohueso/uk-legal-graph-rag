At question 3, the claimant was asked whether there was any medical or other evidence that she wished to rely upon. The document did not stress that medical evidence was likely to be necessary, nor did it suggest that a claimant should ensure that they had other evidence that corroborates the answers given.  </span></p>

Judge Burns concluded that the essential ground of appeal was that the Employment Tribunal&#8217;s assessment of disability was wrong and unfair. Judge Burns went on to tease out various components of the analysis that were arguably in error. While it might be said that some of those grounds went rather beyond what was in the grounds of appeal, the respondent adopted the pragmatic approach of accepting the grounds as set out by Judge Burns. Generally, I consider it is good practice, where further grounds have been identified, for them to be the subject of an amendment to the grounds of appeal. </span></p>

In response to an inquiry from me as to whether the grounds fully matched those either in the original grounds of appeal or in the grounds permitted to proceed by Judge Burns, a formal application to amend was made. I granted the application in respect of grounds 1 to 6, but refused to add ground 7, for reasons that I gave this morning. </span></p>

A Tribunal is of course entitled to say after it has assessed the evidence in the case that it finds the evidence of a particular witness so unsatisfactory or unreliable that it is not prepared to act on it unless there is other evidence to support it. A Tribunal which takes such an approach is simply exercising common sense and judgment, not imposing a legal requirement that there be corroboration.</span></p>

It might have concluded that, though she genuinely believed what she was saying, her evidence was unreliable and what she asserted was factually incorrect. Instead, what the Employment Tribunal did was to state that she had not met the standard of proof.  This was done without reaching any conclusion as to her credibility or stating why her evidence should not be accepted. This is clear when dealing with doctors&#8217; appointments (para.55) where the Employment Tribunal said that the material was limited to the claimant&#8217;s assertion and that she had not shown on balance of probabilities that she was not escorted to doctors&#8217; appointments simply because she required a lift. At para.56, the Employment Tribunal said there was no evidence other than the claimant&#8217;s assertion and, therefore, her evidence was rejected.

There is some suggestion that, during the period in which the claimant had been in employment, she had not gone to the dentist. She appears to have accepted that was the case, but said that she went to the emergency dentist once. The Tribunal held: &#8220;I do not find this to be credible to the required standard of proof.&#8221; It would have been open to the Employment Tribunal to find as a fact that the claimant had not visited the emergency dentist, but it did not do so. The claimant had given evidence that she had visited the emergency dentist and there was no direct evidence to contradict it. </span></p>

Again, this was a simple issue in respect of which the Employment Tribunal should either have concluded that the claimant did or did not have difficulties in food shopping as a result of her medical condition. If she did, the Employment Tribunal should have gone on to decide whether, when considered with any other adverse effects, the adverse effects including her ability to shop for food were more than minor or trivial; and, whether the effects met the long-term criteria.

From paras.59-62, the Employment Tribunal recorded that the claimant stated that she could feel anxious and display physical symptoms that affected her ability to complete household tasks. The Employment Tribunal held that the assertion had not been proven on balance of probabilities. This determination was based on scoring that the claimant had given during CBT sessions between August 2021 and February 2022 when she had been asked to state on a regular basis how she considered she was limited in carrying out specific activities. The scores varied. The Employment Tribunal averaged the scores over a period rather than considering the most significant. The approach adopted to the scores is challenged by ground 3:</span></p>

I cannot see a rational basis upon which an average of her scores was used to demonstrate that there was no substantial adverse effect on day-to-day activities. The scores were the claimant&#8217;s self-description of her condition. They fluctuated considerably. I appreciate that the Employment Tribunal might have concluded that those self-descriptions were incorrect, but it did not do so. Because there were periods during which the adverse effects had been greater than others, the Employment Tribunal should have considered whether, during the periods that the effects were at their most severe, they were more than minor or trivial, and then concluded whether such effects met the long-term criteria, including consideration of the possibility of them recurring.

The Employment Tribunal rejected the claimant&#8217;s evidence on the basis that she had not established on the balance of probabilities that her sleep was adversely affected. In doing so, the Tribunal specifically referred to lack of corroboration. Accordingly, I consider that ground 2 is made out in respect of the issue of sleep. </span></p>

Furthermore, the claimant referred to not having been able to attend work on two occasions because of lack of sleep.  That, on the face of it, was clearly more than minor or trivial and would have raised the question, as it was a sporadic occurrence, whether it was likely to recur. The Employment Tribunal rejected the claimant&#8217;s evidence because it came out during cross-examination and that, therefore, there was an inequality of footing because the respondent could not have known that they were to meet this issue. There is no rule that a party cannot rely on evidence that results from cross-examination. It is the very nature of cross-examination that it will occasionally elicit further evidence that may support the case of a party being challenged. Accordingly, ground 4 is also made out in relation to sleep. </span></p>

The Employment Tribunal also relied on CBT scores, averaging them in a manner that I consider was irrational.
